If you think CSGO was bad, you're in for a treat. You'll enjoy getting hit behind walls, zero damage direct rocket hits, leading nailgun shots a few meters off the target in close range fights and more stupid bullshit that shouldn't happen in a game of this caliber, especially if it tries to sell itself as an 'esport'\n\n- Horrible optimization and performance, you really need a powerful PC to run this game at decent framerates without any stuttering/freezing. Very CPU-bound performance, also it hates slow HDDs. Mouse feels delayed and floaty at the same FPS compared to Quake Live.\n\n- Too much visual noise and distractions even at the lowest settings. Hard to see what's going on behind all the explosions, LG sparks and what not. Forced FXAA you can't turn off. 4:3 aspect ratio is broken in menus\n\n- Very limited number of client settings, can't even change the crosshair\n\n- Champion balance issues. Some champions are just objectively better than others\n\nVerdict: not recommended at this point unless you're a diehard fan of arena shooters/Quake. Save yourself the nerves and wait until the devs fix it. If you're really dying for it, just get the F2P version at bethesda.net.", "recommendationid": "34749329", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605236", "timestamp_created": 1504584177, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 8052, "last_played": 1507186422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 403, "steamid": "76561197992062636"}, "votes_up": 194}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505055583, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 21, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "As much as I love this game, I can't recommend it in its current state, not for $29.99. If you aren't a huge Quake fan you probably shouldn't buy this game until it improves.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fantastic. Every other big name FPS released this year can't even come close. It's Quake. The multiple characters provide you with a choice between several movement styles and don't force you into playing a specific role; every character plays the same for the most part. This game is not a hero shooter. I wouldn't even call it class-based. There are some active abilities that I'm not fond of, but the passive abilities add a lot to the game in my opinion.\n\nWhile the gameplay itself is fast and fluid, actually getting into a game is slow and tedious. The only way to join a match is through matchmaking. The general flow of game goes something like this:\n[olist]\n[*] Click \"Find Match\" and select gamemodes\n[*] Wait for match (~3 minutes on average for me, starting to get longer)\n[*] Find match, load into match\n[*] Get greeted with a screen that lists players in the server and those still loading in, wait ~25 seconds\n[*] Watch 15 second cutscene of players standing a line for some reason\n[*] 1 minute of warmup time\n[*] Game starts, 10 minutes of action\n[*] Game ends, win/lose message displays for 10 seconds or so\n[*] Ending cutscene showing top 3 players, ~25 seconds\n[*] Scoreboard finally shows up, you can press esc to exit now\n[*] Load back into menu\n[*] Click through all the XP screens and popups\n[*] Decline rematch since it usually fails or bugs out anyway\n[*] Repeat\n[/olist]\nIt feels like constant red lights on a 70mph road. Why not let players play warmup immediately after joining a server? Why not keep the players in the server after each match? Why can't I skip the stupid cutscenes? Why not present the rematch vote during the ridiculously long ending sequence? It's so obnoxiously tedious and ineffecient that I'm usually sick of it after 3 matches or so. Close to 50% of time in-game is spent in menus and cutscenes. It's horribly, horribly structured.\n\nThe servers/hitreg/network/whatever is subpar, even by 2017 standards. I'm skeptical of whether or not this can actually be fixed to an acceptable degree. I think this will be the determining factor of whether long-time Quake players stick with the game or migrate elsewhere. \n\nQuake Champions likes to crash a lot, too. There are several different memory leaks right now apparently. I can get through 1 match without much stuttering, if I try to play more than 2 games in a row I usually crash during the 3rd match. The game is still very much in beta, so be aware.\n\nSteamworks integration is almost nonexistent. The in-game friend and invite system is completely seperate, people you play with don't show up in the recent players window. There is currently no way to chat with other players unless you're in the same lobby.\n\nDuel is a joke. I've tried to give it a fair chance, I really have. A three frag limit is just not fun. It places too much emphasis on each life; one unlucky spawn will usually result in a lost round, especially since each round lasts only 5 minutes and regaining the upper hand against a skilled opponent is difficult enough in a standard 10 minute duel. The differing health and armor amounts for each character can feel like a real hindrance in this mode, too. Combine all this with a larger emphasis on active abilities and the whole mode just feels like a real mess. I'm sure someone out there likes it, but I sure don't. \n\nI don't like the stance the developers have taken in regards to how the game is presented. I don't mind cash shops or cosmetic items or anything like that, especially since this game was intended to be free-to-play. In short, the \"games as a service\" model in itself doesn't bother me. \nWhat I take issue with is the overly restrictive attitude they've applied to every other aspect of the game. Want to disable the obnoxious bloom effects that blind you everytime you fire LG? Too bad, no option for that in the settings menu, and the developers have recently stated they won't be adding that option because reasons. But no problem right? Just edit the config file instead. Oh wait, there isn't a straightforward way to do that, because [b]everything is deliberately obfuscated for no apparent reason[/b]. Something as simple (and essential) as capping your framerate is a massive hassle. There is no server browser, command console, config file, local matches, etc. If this game had been released a few years ago they'd be applying the same logic to adjustable FOV as well. If I didn't love this game so much I'd be eagerly anticipating its demise. I hope the developers have a change of heart soon, because this level of restriction and petty micromanagement will severely hurt the appeal and longevity of the game. This statement will probably annoy a lot of people, but compare the presentation of this game to that of CS:GO, which one feels like a more complete product?\n\n\nThis game is a real diamond in the rough. It's really the only multiplayer FPS that I've genuinely liked in a really long time, so for me it was worth the price. I have my doubts that this game will ever reach its full potential. Even if the developers manage to fix the major issues and polish everything up nicely, the constant additions of new champions makes me wary. I'm even more doubtful that it'll attract new players after the way it was dumped onto Steam in such a state. It's supposedly going free-to-play by 2018, so I would hold off purchasing until then.\n\n", "recommendationid": "34863959", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574906", "timestamp_created": 1505055583, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 508, "playtime_forever": 3001, "last_played": 1506639483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 251, "steamid": "76561198053102631"}, "votes_up": 67}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504959830, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 31, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "although I'm new to quake I love it, but I wouldn't recommend this quake until they've ironed out most issues. \n\nQuake champions feel iffy with weird hit reg (noticed it mostly with the RG and RL the most) where most shots don't miss that should've hit and I'm not talking about shots that you could've hit but the ones you've seen shots clearly hit but hear no hitsound.\n \nanother thing is matchmaking.

I actually remember downloading qtest long ago.  I was a member of RB, we won the T2 ClanRing tournament.  Some of our noteable members include Froggy, Atari, Fo0k and Y0.  Several of us moved on to game development.  In RB, I competed under the name, \"Anub1s.\"  This current iteration of Quake has major problems.  Honestly, I purchased Quake Champions because... (1) I've always loved the franchise... and (2) Adam Pyle is a standup kinda guy and I wanted to show my financial support.  But, every day, I struggle to decide if I want to keep playing this game.  I can't figure out if I'm an optimist or just a mascohist.\n\nWhat are the problems with Quake Champions?  The net code is incredibly frustrating.  Some of the problems relate to lag compensation... dsync... and others relate, imho, to hit boxes.  Hit boxes should be changed to capsule shaped.  Currently, they are nearly model tight.  Model tight works in military sims with sniper rifles and elaborate worlds, but not of a game of the current genre.  Quake has always been a quick twitch game.  Anyway, the net code... while playing the game you will experience weapons such as the rocket launcher doing 0 or 1 damage.  It's even worse against specific champions.  It happens A LOT.  You will also experience rails hitting you while you're around a corner. You will die from shots while you're on the other side of a portal.  I could go on and on.  There are also ongoing memory leaks with the game.  \n\nWhat are the positives?  Well, the visual aesthetics are very cool.  The company has revisited the gothic Lovecraftian vibe again.  For the most part, the maps are well designed.  Some people hate the atmospheric music, but I thought Chris Vrenna from NIN fame did an awesome job.  If the company ever sorts out the network code and hit box nonsense this game could be special.  As of right now, I can't recommend it.", "recommendationid": "34813901", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533987", "timestamp_created": 1504875047, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 873, "last_played": 1506888020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "steamid": "76561198087902257"}, "votes_up": 42}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505039277, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 19, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Quake Champions \"Feels\" right the same way DOOM does. The sounds, impacts and movement just has that \"oomph\" to it. The maps are of varied quality, but the community mostly seems to vote for the descent ones. Quake is back and I don't need to tell you why that is good.\n\nUnfortunately at this time I cannot recommend this game due to a few reasons:\n\n- Netcode: The netcode in this game is the worst I have EVER come across. Sometimes your shots won't deal full damage (Point blank shotgun for 4dmg?) or simply won't deal damage at all. For some reason, shooting someone in the air with a rocket deals the least consistent damage and only  about half (I am not exaggerating this one bit) of my hits actually register! It is absolutely infuriating when you ambush someone carrying the Quad, hit them with 2 rockets in the back that deal zero damage only to have them turn around and burn you to ashes with the lightning gun in .1 second.\n\n- Balance: Some of the champions are just objectively better than others (Some people actually make fun of you if you play Sorlag) and the lightning gun deals ludicrous amounts of damage despite being the easiest weapon to use.\n\n- Performance: I'm running a GTX980 with 16GB of RAM and i7-6700K. The game runs smooth of silk for the first 3 matches, but then at match 4 it starts to stutter and progressively gets worse until it is barely playable at match 7 and the game needs to be restarted. I had this experience when playing the closed BETA as well but it has become significantly worse since then.\n\n- Achievements and runes that won't work: The game has lootboxes. Every shooter since overwatch seems to have them. You earn them by levelling up or by purchasing them for curency. Curency can be earned by simply playing, completing daily challenges or rune challanges. Rune challenges are unique to each character and may consist of winning 10 DM games, using your character's ability 100 times or killing 50 people with rockets. Unfortunately these don't always work and despite killing about 18 people with rockets in my first game, the rune only registered 1 kill.\n\nI'm sure these will be fixed down the line before the game leaves early access, but as it stands, Quake Champions is just not worth it.

It feels just like Quake 3 to me, but with upgraded visuals. I was a bit skeptical at first due to this whole ability thing, but they've made it work and even fit in the entire Quake universe - at least in my opinion. I dislike some of the weapon design;  like the railgun and the lightning gun - but luckily we are given the option to replace most of the weapon models with older versions of themselves from previous games, which is great. I'm liking the maps as well, but DM6 still holds a special place in my heart, so it remains a favourite. \n\nAs for the game modes, there's the good ol' regular deathmatch (kill everything on sight), team deathmatch (kill everything on sight with buddies), duel (speaks for itself), and a new mode called \"sacrifice\" in which the objective is to grab a skull that they refer to as an \"obelisk\", take it to your base, and defend it against the enemy team until it has been sacrificed. \n\nI haven't touched sacrifice, kinda hoping for a capture the flag mode instead (something Tim Willits himself said that they'd look into), and while I'm not a huge fan of the new duel system (each player picks 3 champions that they will play, first one to eliminate all enemy champions wins - or kill one and survive until you hit the timelimit of 5 minutes I guess), it kinda works when you get the hang of it. The DM and TDM feels just right to me though.\n\nA nice little feature (that some people will care very little about, and others quite a lot - I myself find it a fun little aspect) - is that there's a lot of customization available for the champions and weapons. The champions all have different armor sets, that can also have their colors altered with armor shaders. These armor pieces and colors are unlocked with chests that you are rewarded with every level. Every 5 levels you are awarded a reliquary, the largest chest with maximum amount of rewards. You can also buy backpacks with the in-game currency \"favor\" that you get a small amount of after each match. The weapon color shaders only applies to the standard weapons. If you unlock a legendary weapon you will be unable to change its color. Not that I mind - they're legendary for a reason!\n\nOn the topic of features - you can also unlock runes from the abovementioned backpacks. Each champion has different rune challenges that can be completed for each of the 4 gods - 10 challenges per god. It can be everything from getting 50 machinegun kills, to get \"denied\" medals against a specific champion. Once you completed a gods challenges, you will be rewarded with a unique armor shader. I find this a good feature as you will always have something to do in matches, even when losing badly. Focusing on these little missions will give the match more purpose. I find it an excellent addition. The separate challenges awards the player with stuff as well upon completion. Everything from favor to shards (another currency), backpacks, chests, and even reliquaries for the hardest challenges. In short, it's rewarding af.\n\nThe visuals are good but a bit strange, I don't see much difference between high and low. Textures and shadows seems to make the biggest difference I guess. It runs well though. My setup is an i5 4570, 16gb's of RAM, and I've got a GTX960 with 4gb of memory - and the game runs remarkably smooth. I'm running most settings on low, but I recently increased texture quality to high, and antialiasing to medium - with no noticable difference to my fps. I'd say it's well-optimized, though I have seen a lot of complaints from people getting microstutters - something that is apparently caused by memory leaks, and can mostly be solved by restarting the game.\n\nWhile on the topic of issues, there are a couple of more of those. The netcode can be a bit sketchy sometimes, and rubberbanding occurs now and then. I personally seldomly suffer from it, but again, other people have complained about it. The hitboxes of the champions also need a little bit of work, something I believe they will adress in the coming patch.\n\nAll in all it's an amazing game, especially for being in early access! I personally think the game will only get better from here. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for us quakers.\n\nI highly recommend this title to any Quake fan, young and old.", "recommendationid": "35091043", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518148", "timestamp_created": 1505937055, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 112, "playtime_forever": 9757, "last_played": 1507167306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1849, "steamid": "76561198036645650"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506171071, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "6/10\n\nI'm still undecided about this, but the netcode for this game feels off to me, not as respoisve as Doom multiplayer at this point in time. \n\nThe games assets and artwork and everything else though is incredibly well done including excellent audio and textures within the levels which have a great sense of place and atmosphere that is Quake like.\n\nI will update this review if my experience changes, but my recent experiences the netcode feels like playing on ice..\n\nThe game needed Multiplayer CTF with gappling hooks, but I guess that ship sailed with Q2, but I think this was a missed oppertunity to bring back that game mode, instead of doing another overwatch variant of Quake3.", "recommendationid": "35152750", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512945", "timestamp_created": 1506171071, "author": {"num_reviews": 71, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 136, "last_played": 1505399197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970330256"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506192912, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "EDIT leaving negative review until something changes.\nAmazingly fun game, needs balances.

If you want to be a fast and dodgy junkie, a sneaky, invisible one or a bulkier kind of monster you\u2019ve got them all here to fit your kind of style. \n\nSome may disagree but I find this game particularly intriguing due to the fact that you can customize your character the way you want, which gives you a feeling of having your own, unique character. The customization comes in different \u201cskins\u201d a.k.a \u201cshaders\u201d for your armor/characters which let you change the color or pattern. And also whole exchangeable parts from your armor, going from Head, Chest, Legs and Vanity items. Vanity items are a bit rarer to get, either you buy them with real money or you hope to get them in a Loot Box at a low percentage. Their idea of adding Loot Boxes to Quake is used by a lot of games nowadays such as CS:GO, Dota 2, Overwatch, Team Fortress 2 and many others. These are so called \u201cMicrotransactions\u201d used to get more income out of the game. Keep in mind that these microtransactions won\u2019t give anyone else an advantage, purley cosmetic. It\u2019s surely a smart move nonetheless in the eye of the developers.\n\nI particularly like the improved graphics and the characters. It looks like what any high standard game made in 2017 should look like, sharp, lifelike textures and good shading. Another thing that makes Quake, Quake is it's high skill ceiling. You can never get too good, meaning you will always improve. A downside is that there aren\u2019t so many game modes. Only Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, 1v1 and Sacrifice. Keep in mind that this isn\u2019t a fully released game, it\u2019s still Early Access. One more thing I don\u2019t like is the netcode and hitreg, but those things will be fixed really soon. It\u2019s ID Software we\u2019re talking about here.\n\nLooking back at the older Quake games, there is no surprise that you will encounter severe gore and high speed. Now add this to next generation graphics and you have got yourself [b]one hell of a game[/b] with an experience like no other these days. \n\nOverall rating (Out of 10)\nGraphics: 9\nMusic: 8\nContent: 6\nControls: 8\nGameplay: 7\n\nI [b]strongly[/b] advise you to get this game if you are into AFPS games.

And it made me want to get all the other Quake games and play through them.  I love this game and it's a blast to play with non-stop action. But I can't recommend Quake Champions in its current state to everyone. There are still a bunch of performance and netcode issues that I encounter almost every time I play the game. But I still play it even with these problems. When the devs fix those two main problems then the game will be a lot easier to recommend. \n\nThe gameplay itself is incredible, netcode issues aside, I never seem to have a dull moment when I play this game besides waiting in the lobby for the next game to start (which can take several minutes). When I first played the Alpha a few months ago I was complete garbage. Having never played a Quake game before I didn't really know what strafe jumping was and why it was so important. I would end up getting destroyed when I first played the game but that didn't stop me. I wanted to get better at it. I played a bit and got better at strafe jumping, found out which characters I enjoy playing as, and learned the weapon/health placements on the maps. I like the grind of Quake because there will always be someone that's better than you at something. You have to dedicate time to practicing your jumps and you need to know when you should use certain weapons over others. Yeah I did rage a lot, but I'm a lot better than when I first started playing. Now I usually come in first, second, or third in the game and I'm really enjoying it.\n\nNow just because I really like this game doesn't mean everyone should go buy it right now. It's still in Beta and they have to add a lot more content before I could recommend this game to anyone for $29.99. But the developers have adressed a lot of issues the community has been vocal about. Hero tweaking, CTF (Eventually), New maps, and Ranked play will hopefully be coming in the next few months. Once the game launches it will be F2P and you will have one champion to start out with and you will be able to unlock the other champions without paying. So unless you are a diehard arena shooter fan I would say wait until the F2P version comes out and try that out.", "recommendationid": "34894055", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507622", "timestamp_created": 1505184706, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_forever": 1505, "last_played": 1506131925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "steamid": "76561198037994492"}, "votes_up": 20}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504862545, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It's so fun I uninstalled Overwatch in between rounds.

If you found yourself playing Quake 3 Arena in the past couple of years and wished there was a newer version with better graphics, then I think this game is for you.\n\nIf you don't fall into the above category, I don't think you will enjoy this game in its current form unless you are expecting and willing to persist through the frustration that is their user interface, and the likely frustration losing will bring vs a mature user base that have grown up on this style of death match.\n\nThose rough edges I spoke about are things like:\n1. UI is awkward in many many places.  If I had to guess, it was written for controller only first, and then mouse support tacked on after the fact.  Mouse hit targets aren't always accurate, and hover indicates are missing on some things.\n2. Viewing the campion details, and related \"sub menus\" (for lack of a better way to describe whatever it is the ended up making) are awkwardly layed out and there are a lot of permanent fixtures to the UI with little to no context of \"where\" you currently are in viewing the details.  For example, you can switch champions at almost any level of the UI, but you have to back out the right amount in order to see the \"top level\" details which includes the champion abilities.  The \"drilled in\" view has multiple \"tabs\" for switching to see different details but the most important \"tab\" isn't included, and one needs to know that you have to go \"back\" to get to the top level details.  I'm sure it is serviceable once the awkward structure is understood.\n3. Game runs poorly at max (framerate drops whenever a player comes into view), which was auto selected for my hardware (980 ti).  Trying to lower it didn't have a positive impact on the performance without restarting the client.  Since the perf problem only shows up with other players, you have to be in a match (training doesn't have players).  So I guess they expect you to join matches many many times, and restart the client many many times until it runs properly, unless you like your framerate to drop at the exact moment you don't want it to drop.\n\nBut other than that, if you can get it running well, once your are in game it feels and plays a lot like the good old Quake 3 Arena.  \n", "recommendationid": "34767672", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500929", "timestamp_created": 1504661377, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 121, "last_played": 1504577628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962745040"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507151249, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This Game is great you get the classic old feeling of Quake.\nThis game biggest problem is that somehow designed that upload speed and Frames per Second are related and if you have the best internet but have low upload speed you are gonna lag a lot the Framerate drops to the toilet and makes this game unplayable until this isn't fixed i won't recommend you buy this right now at least wait until the full release.", "recommendationid": "35480599", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501360", "timestamp_created": 1507151249, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 126, "playtime_forever": 254, "last_played": 1507150421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561198189712813"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 280, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 1141, "total_positive": 861, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
