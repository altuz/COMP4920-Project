(Full disclosure: I know the artist personally.)\n\nThe game is a fun, fast-paced arcade experience with a hint of Pac-Man at its core. The player needs to dig up graves to collect bodyparts without being caught by the groundskeeper or the ever-increasing number of monsters infesting the graveyards. Loads of additional enemy types and power-ups are introduced as the levels go by, keeping the experience fresh and challenging. There are lots of levels, and it takes longer and longer to get through them, so I'm assuming that I'll pour many hours into this game before beating it. I'm assuming that the game was created with gamepad controls in mind, but I'm playing it on a keyboard, which works totally fine, especially because custom keybinding is possible.\n\nIn my opinion, Grave Chase is absolutely worth its full price, especially if you like arcade-y gameplay and gory pixel art.", "recommendationid": "35094556", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507700", "timestamp_created": 1505954165, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 362, "playtime_forever": 127, "last_played": 1506038440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198067295093"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505950877, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Definitely worth the price of admission; a fast, frenetic, arcade-style game.

With all the different types of enemies and power-ups in each of the levels, along with the different stage designs, it really keeps you on your toes. The controls handle well and the animations are fluid and bouncy. The Sount track is energetic and catchy, and the pixel art is really nicely done too. Difficulty isn't too easy or too hard.
