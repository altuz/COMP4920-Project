I am not a horror fan, but this game was interesting. Here's why:\n\nThe game is not much to look at - a simplistic interact system, white enamel furniture, and constant digital flicker through windows. Progression is guided by noises and shifting lighting, which keeps the player moving through story sequences. \n\nThe premise of the game is the good part - the player's role is as the player of a video game, and the baddie is a character inside the game your character (the guy playing the game) is playing. The baddie wants to escape the computer. Mono then uses game crashes, glitches, and blue screens (in-game) as, essentially, game-over or end of sequence screens.\n\nSo yeah. It's clever, it's short, and it made me yell frightened obscenities at my computer despite looking bland.", "recommendationid": "31169127", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "timestamp_created": 1492310190, "author": {"num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 324, "playtime_forever": 63, "last_played": 1492108945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043735930"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499209430, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This game made me have to change my pants!!\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4vaXmSf3ko]>>youtube let's play here<<[/url]\n\nPros\nGreat atmosphere!\nreally good jumpscares!\nsuoer underpriced for the games look and feel!\n\ncons\nsuper confusing, waking around to die then wake up die, exact same repeat. mostly because im bad at games,\n\n8-10 love it!", "recommendationid": "32258321", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497478", "timestamp_created": 1496879637, "author": {"num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 136, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1491395334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014910652"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 20, "total_positive": 19, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
