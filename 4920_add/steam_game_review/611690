Concept and aesthetics are fantastic and right up my alley, but the way the game feels to play is just so off-putting. Let me describe to you from FPS gamer to FPS gamer: There is no inertia. Any change in movement input is enacted instantly with no respect for momentum. Aiming while moving becomes jittery and impercise to the point one must retrain how they aim in an FPS for this one game.\n\nBut wait; there's more! Graphical options are a simple A/B setting. Now I don't mean individual options are either high or low, no I mean the whole set is either high or low. Add to that various cinematography effects like motion blur and while you have a great game for screenshots; it just looks and feels horrible to play. Jittery lack of inertia in the aiming while moving with having to aim through motion blur is on a level of annoyance it made my skin crawl.\n\nThe same may not be true for you though. So please! Try the demo~\n\nP.S: You can't change options while in-game. You have to reload the main menu, wait for the animation pan to finish, change w/e options, restart the level you were on, wait for the un-skippable description sequence to end, then it begins loading the level, and press any key to begin so you can test your changes; such as aiming sensitivity. Oh and the first run opening sequence is also un-skippable. As is the main menu pan animation.\n\nNote to Developer: If you change all these problems I have with it and notify me as such; I'll rebuy it at full price happily, and change my entire review. Love the aesthetic and concept; I just wish it was better executed.", "recommendationid": "32400324", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500935", "timestamp_created": 1497397999, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 561, "playtime_forever": 16, "last_played": 1497396165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034361185"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
