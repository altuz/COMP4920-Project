Ultimately I have returned the game for the time being. It REALLY needs more customization for the setup. my holster was WAY too high on my body, so id play a stage 20 times and go to draw to see my hands empty bc my gun wasnt where it should be on my hip. The locomotion needs some work as others have said. Overall I'm leaving as a reccomend b/c the idea is awesome, the dev is active and working on things, its definitely playable etc. It's just not worth $20 to me right now. Im sure I'll buy again down the road. The holster thing alone would get me to rebuy.", "recommendationid": "34297487", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1502932648, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 251, "playtime_forever": 96, "last_played": 1506204168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "steamid": "76561197967662747"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 7, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
