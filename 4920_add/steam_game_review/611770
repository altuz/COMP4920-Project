For example, you need to Alt-F4 to exit out of Classic Mode, and the Level Editor is only very bare bones.\nHowever, the main part of the game, Story Mode, is working fine - so don't let the Early Access label stop you from buying it.\n\nIt costs $4 (although I picked it up with a Steam discount coupon for $1) - either way, its cost is quite reasonable.\n\nIt's nothing amazing, just another linear space-shooting game (an updated version of those games that have been around since the 1990s), but it provides some cheap entertainment - so I can recommend it on that basis.", "recommendationid": "34541479", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531939", "timestamp_created": 1503877144, "author": {"num_reviews": 131, "num_games_owned": 2079, "playtime_forever": 139, "last_played": 1503918236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996890045"}, "votes_up": 16}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502135096, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I am mainly reviewing the following game based off its quality and potential, not the price.\n\n+ Has very good quality for its genre, the graphics are alright and work well with the concepts of the game.\n+ Some of the music is outstanding, not sure if its original or not but regardless, it makes the game more enjoyable.\n+ There are several gamemodes and they all work well.\n+ No playability issues (game logic makes sense)\n+ The atmosphere is engaging\n+ There is even a level editor which is rare for these kinds of indie games.\n\n- The game concepts are a bit overused (However this game is one of the best of its kind)\n- Some of the model art could use a bit of work, some characters and enemies could be upgraded\n\nI was able to purchase this game discounted and it was well worth what I payed, because I could actually enjoy the game instead of just using it for more trading cards.

It's another side scrolling shooter that looks awful and the gameplay isn't far off. It's way too easy and there's really no punishment for death because you have way too many lives and you just respawn where you die. The power ups have this \"level\" system which sound interesting at first but then you realize that all it does is a little more damage and nothing else new, and it caps out at level two. Another thing is that this is just any other side scrolling shooter that you can find on places like Newgrounds for free but they charge you for this one. There are no gimmics to set this game apart from those games and some Newgrounds games look and play better than this game and they're free! tl;dr This game is bad, don't buy it.", "recommendationid": "34125900", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495070", "timestamp_created": 1502288076, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 6, "last_played": 1502232844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198123456079"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501870127, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1502415532, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "developer_response": "OK, now just tell me how exactly you suppose the gamepad to work in a game where you go WASD+mouse?
