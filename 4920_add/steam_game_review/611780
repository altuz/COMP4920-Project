Combining crafting, puzzles, a bit of mystery and a story that keeps you interested just enough, Across The Moment gets a recommendation from me.  There are some obvious flaws - the broken English can throw you off a bit.  There isn't a whole lot in the way of clues on how to progress at times.  I encountered a bit of lag and screen tearing - though that could be based entirely off my aging rig.  \n\nGraphically the game takes a more stylistic approach which I think suits it better. Though you may find the color scheme a bit bland and the assets a bit redundant.  \n\nOverall the game has some promise and seems to offer a decent amount for a relatively cheap entry point.  So I feel comfortable suggesting it if these adventure/puzzle type games are more your speed. Just don't expect action - you won't find it.  \n\nIf you're interested in seeing a bit of gameplay (where I get stuck...): https://youtu.be/snqQuqVM1Ow", "recommendationid": "32224848", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508023", "timestamp_created": 1496772770, "author": {"num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 56, "last_played": 1498236760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025227359"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496779518, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Did you know that not very often you can find a really great quest with a dramatic atmosphere? I can tell you: this is impossible. \n\nI noticed this game when it was just a development and add it to the bookmarks. In fact, I did't think it would be such an interesting game. So, today it was a very low price for this game, and I like quests, so I bought and ... it's really cool, I forgot about the time and just played. Full world, simple color, good illustration, plot, cool puzzles, everything is done very well. I just started playing and I reached the second world.
