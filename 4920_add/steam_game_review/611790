I do not disagree with that. But let's be honest here, it's not that decent of a game even for 15 dollars. It's not worth 15 dollars for the sheer value and content that it currently offers. \n\nThere are a few basic mechanics that I do not see why it hasn't been updated into the game already. There is a missing continue game function on the main menu. Which is odd. It's tedious to start a new game just to load a save file. NPCs will keep walking away from you when you're trying to interact with them until you finally click on talk or give. And even when you do, the camera won't even pan towards them, if they already walked off the screen, you're talking to a blanket of air. Additionally, NPCs will just walk around with glitchy legs and clutter in rooms and hallways. And certain areas, although small are just so dark and hard to see. For example the kitchen counter, unless the object is a bright color, it literally just blends in with the counter and stove. \n\nGameplay is super linear. As of now, there isn't much diversity in the paths you can take to achieve certain goals for the characters you want to get sexual with. Sure you can do particular steps in different orders that don't necessarily affect the outcome you want, but it makes no difference to the story. Yea it's early access, I get that. But there is a worry for the development of this game.\n\n\u201cWe will eventually call one of the versions 1.0. I can see that happening before the end of 2017. But that doesn't mean that we won't continue to update the game with new stories.\u201d\n\n I just don't see how this game can leave early access by the end of 2017 ( as if the game could even be considered \"finished\" with the lackluster updates). At least that's what I'm getting from my interpretation. The game will leave early access which will be called 1.0. But the game will continue to be supported with updates. That's what it sounds like to me.  But don't push me too hard on that. If anyone can confirm otherwise, please do so respectfully.\n\nAnd I've read some reviews and oh boy the patreon thing just doesn't sit well with me. Asking for even more money when people already gave money to support the game being developed right now. I'm not the ethical police here. I'm just stating what I'm seeing. Moving on. \n\nIn conclusion, wait for a sale or not buy it at all. As funny and silly the positive reviews ( as most steam reviews are), I feel it's egregious that such reviews are praised while negative ones with real criticism are for the most part \"shunned\", for the lack of a better word. Certain basic functions like the continue game and NPC walking bug ruins the most basic experience you would think a game would have implemented. I'm no engineer, but I am saying if you're a professional developer or even amateur, you'd have at least enough experience to implement basic functions. I completely respect and support Eek in the fight against censorship where it's hypocritical that video games with extreme violence and gore is accepted by most of the game industry. The game in it's current state isn't for me, if it ever even improves beyond the experience I had.", "recommendationid": "35060569", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715741", "timestamp_created": 1505811096, "author": {"num_reviews": 47, "num_games_owned": 304, "playtime_forever": 197, "last_played": 1505799059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082612211"}, "votes_up": 201}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505240554, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 41, "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 20, "review": "Needs a Playable Female", "recommendationid": "34906141", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622195", "timestamp_created": 1505240554, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_forever": 88, "last_played": 1505182220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013687199"}, "votes_up": 146}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506369099, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 29, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 5, "review": "If you're here for the nudes, let me tell you that it's not worth it.
