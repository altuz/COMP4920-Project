There are so many levels to play, and you can add on the fact you can make your own levels! I did get a refund though, because it was very difficult. I couldn't stand how difficult it was, but to be fair, I do find a lot of games difficult. The only thing I wish was that there were more levels, because once you compelte all of them, it would get a little boring, considering there is no goal to the game.", "recommendationid": "34893037", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501117", "timestamp_created": 1505178485, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 64, "playtime_forever": 78, "last_played": 1505176478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198214470752"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 19, "total_positive": 19, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
