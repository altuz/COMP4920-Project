This is a terible scam. 4 minutes in and I'm already asking for refund (I was forced to play another minute to make a review, lol. 5minutes requirement:)). And I am not some picky player. It was just SO terrible already.\nMy experience in those 4 minutes.\nNo music. Sound almost absent expect few interactions which are ridiculously loud. It also seem inconsistent. Abysmal combat = enemies just run at you and through you and you just swing all around. No shielding, no tactic, no nothing.. in fact even no collisions at all. I don't even know if I hit them, there is no sound, no particles, no change in behavior in enemies, truely no nothing..and then they die in a moment of swinging in the air.\nWell.. I already spend more time writing this review than playing the \"game\". Just beware and do not buy this even for a $1. JUST NO\n\t\t", "recommendationid": "34150969", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525723", "timestamp_created": 1502385125, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_forever": 5, "last_played": 1502385039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083978612"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502772068, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is the kind of game that gives Early Access titles a bad name.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UMTMOyiGmpE\n\nTimeToDie has some major issues that I can't believe the dev(s) didn't know about when they released their game and priced it at $19.99. I've played far better free to play games. I rarely refund games but this title will join that very small list of titles.\n\nLets start with everyone's favorite topic. Locomotion. We get no options for trackpad or teleport. We just get a trackpad locomotion option. My preference lies with trackpad locomotion but options always trump being forced into one or the other.\n\nThe bigger issue though is the frequent sliding. At times I felt like I was on ice. I'd tap to go forward just a bit and slide 10 feet away from where I wanted to be. It doesn't make sense with the terrain and is just plain frustrating when you're not expecting it.\n\nMoving on from locomotion, the sound was either non existent or waaaay off from what it should have been. Background music was hit or miss and weapon swings either had no audio cues that you landed a hit or a delayed, overly loud, explosive sound.\n\nThe HMD auto-adjusted my height to a fixed point even when bending down to pick up a weapon, resulting in the world jumping around me and my height drastically changing while playing. I imagine for most this could cause serious comfort issues.\n\nGraphically the game was just so-so. There have been better and there have been worse. I did like the lighting however the visual fidelity of the game didn't match the price tag.\n\nI haven't even talked about the two elephants in the room yet.\n\nWhat's a key componant of a hack and slash game? The weapons? Yes. That's right, the weapons. The things I couldn't pick up roughly 50% of the time I tried to play. Whether tapping grip or pressing and holding, certain weapons would not slot into my hand. They would fly off into the distance like a kernel of popcorn. This alone makes the game pretty close to, if not, unplayable. \n\nThe thing that DOES make the game unplayable is that I crashed to desktop 3 times in a 30 minute play session.\n\nThis game reeks of a dev that either didn't care enough to test his game before putting it out into Early Access or a dev that knew exactly what he was doing, hoping he could make a few quick bucks by dropping a VR roguelike into a RPG starved community. My gut leans toward the latter and I'll be requesting a refund as soon as this review gets posted.\n\nI firmly believe games and devs like this are the issue with the EA system. I hope you all vote with your wallet on this one.", "recommendationid": "34249058", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507502", "timestamp_created": 1502772068, "author": {"num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 36, "last_played": 1502763954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983689849"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
