I got so caught up in the exploration that I almost forgot what I was running around for (stupid pets)!\n\nThere's a good challenge on the first playthrough, which you'll inevitably fail because healing is limited, even if enemies don't respawn once killed, and they mostly just run back and forth in extremely limited patterns. Items are limited, though some are re-usable at a cost of gems, which are limited. Backpack space grows quickly, limited to 9 slots. You'll generally have more than enough money to go around, and even money's limited. Items to resurrect dead party members are limited. But there's a shop...limited to only one of each item for sale. Even the initial map is limited!\n\nAll the limitations make for good gameplay, though! It forces you to focus on inventory management, particularly only taking what you need instead of trying to load up on everything. The game punishes hoarding pretty harshly when you die. Lots of deaths can also mean not being able to complete a run. In which case you will have start a new game. Once you know your way around, following playthroughs become much more strategic!\n\nFortunately, each character has their own set of stats, and the gem reduction upgrade you get fairly early on (depending on how murdery you are) makes certain items free to use with certain family members. You can swap party members back at the house whenever you want, so this gives you some reason to not use the boy (occasionally (sometimes(maybe))).\n\nI only had a couple of issues. First and foremost was being unable to change the controls. The gamepad controls are tolerable, but Up to switch items and Down to drop them, particularly when you're forced to use the thumbsticks instead of the D-pad, are not good controls. I dropped items on the ground frequently or found myself set to a random item in my list. Not too terrible, just annoying.\n\nLadders are also kind of annoying. They stop you from attacking reliably, and you can't jump off the middle so place them wisely. Even attempting to jump off the top is sometimes a gamble.\n\nIn the end, it was a pretty good game overall, so go ahead and buy it! It'll scratch that Metroidvania itch for a day or two, at least.", "recommendationid": "33941180", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503065", "timestamp_created": 1501558213, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 53, "playtime_forever": 542, "last_played": 1501555528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198094882627"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
