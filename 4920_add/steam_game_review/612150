It uses simplistic arena designs and a very small pool of enemies to horde the player with. The highpoints of the game involve strategic handling of large masses of enemies, with occasional attention to constant dodging.\n\nThe action can seem a bit slow on easy difficulties, wherein you're in no danger of being killed by the slow-moving, barely damaging enemies.\n\nWould recommend the higher difficulties to people who're into the horde-management kind of combat. It works well.\n\nPlay it with nightmode, or whatever the game calls it!", "recommendationid": "31124144", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513194", "timestamp_created": 1492118036, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 17, "last_played": 1492117525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018816764"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492115256, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Fun game! :D Waiting for a PVP Mode and More Awesome Weapons!", "recommendationid": "31123452", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504074", "timestamp_created": 1492115256, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 383, "playtime_forever": 16, "last_played": 1492115125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052292891"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492973103, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Well first if you couldn't tell from the trailer the game runs at what looks and feels like 25fps. So thats not great, but it's a new game and that is something that could be patched. Moving on the game only has 4 weapons you can buy and that's it. no upgrades, or attachments are available. So you run out of toys to play with after 5-6 waves. There is no progression that carries over from other sessions. Just endless waves of the same 3 enemy types spawning over and over. Also from what I could tell theres only really 2 modes theres the regular mode that has lighting in the map and one without. As far as difficulty there doesn't seem to be much difference between normal and hard. As for nightcore from what I could tell it's just hard with the lights off. The map does change and introduce platforms, but they serve very little purpose other than getting in the way, or giving you a spot to sit and VERY slowly heal. Since the enemies can't jump up them. This game feels like a place holder demo and isn't worth your money in my opinion. Unless you are wanting to get it on a steep sale or a cheap bundle to make a few cents off the cards. The only reason I played this is because I thought it could be like the old ratchet and clank areanas or like the deathlock spin off in that series, but it is not even close. I would not recommend this game to anyone. You'll have seen all it has to offer in about 20-30 minutes if not less and have to wastse your time requesting a refund.\n\nAlso something I forgot to note is that enemies can get stuck behind the spawning gates leaving you with no way to progress to the next wave. In which case your only option will be to exit the game and start over.", "recommendationid": "31321378", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505837", "timestamp_created": 1492958256, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 253, "playtime_forever": 35, "last_played": 1492956616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133138717"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492366418, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 10, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "As a rutines gamer hvis game took me 15 min on the hardest deficulty with no sweat.. amature game...
