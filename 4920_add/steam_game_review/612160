The controls are really on point. The shooting, especially when you're on a higher level, is so much fun. There is so much variation in the construction of the worlds. I have to admit, that it's not the easiest game I played so far but I love the challenge and it's still fun because I'm getting better every time I play it.\n\nThe enemies seem to be easy targets most of the time but there are quite a few that can be really tedious. All the more fun when you've figured out their weak spot. The most interesting part about this game seems to be, that when you're on a certain skill-level, you can pretty much go on forever. But I think, there's more to it, than to just beat your own highscore over and over again. The story seems to be, that you can decide for yourself, if you wanna stay in this sourrounding of shoot, kill, die, repeat or if there's a way out of it. I've yet to find this way, but I'm eager to progress towards this alternative goal.\n\nThanks to the developer for making this game. It's fun and also challenging, exactly how I like it.\n\nPS: The soundtrack is really amazing. The track, that plays, when the cheat screen is on reminds me of the old Amiga times - perfect. If you didn't buy the original game back then there was often such a screen that looked exactly like the one in Splinter Zone. Nice memories.\n\nSo, of course I highly recommend this game. For this price, it's a steal and you can have fun with it for many hours.", "recommendationid": "32149578", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511590", "timestamp_created": 1496486733, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 643, "last_played": 1499525853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056052621"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
