It's grueling to the point I lost interest after a short while. It's a shame because it let the whole thing down while the concept, graphics and music seemed appealing. But not enough for me to continue playing any longer. It also felt like a childrens game, but children a more impatient than me probably and so I really don't know if I could recommend it even for that. Sorry :( I regret paying for it, I truly expected more and I wish I read the reviews first but I gave it the benefit of the doubt.", "recommendationid": "35314293", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496073", "timestamp_created": 1506723484, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 55, "last_played": 1506723297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "steamid": "76561198323092446"}, "votes_up": 0}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
