The atmosphere is about all this game has going for it.....graphics are actually not that bad\n2. 6 shot double barrels???.....how does that work\n3. Zombies will spawn out of thin air right in front of you\n4. The flash light on your head has some kind of lightsaber technology because it only projects about 7-8 feet in front of you but seems to not reflect off anything beyond that.\n5. The AI is based on a legaly blind Rtard......sometimes they come after you sometimes they just want to ignore you and eat a wall\n6. lots of bugs.\n\nTHis game is garbage.......unless its on sale for .99 cents dont bother", "recommendationid": "31032248", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506350", "timestamp_created": 1491712766, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_forever": 20, "last_played": 1491614067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998320258"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492239513, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Worth what you pay.", "recommendationid": "31150500", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "timestamp_created": 1492239513, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 86, "last_played": 1501702612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198092074067"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494870137, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Decent play for a very short game. Definitely has some draw backs.  Enemies just respawn, and do so right out of thin air and drop down to the floor.  Floods of enemies, a shotgun in each hand and a katana in each hand.
