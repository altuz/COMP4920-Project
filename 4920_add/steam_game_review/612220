What a pile of dog-dookie this game is. This game seems half-ars*d and unfinished, and it doesn't seem to have anything that would compel you to play it for any longer than first couple of levels before you begin to start yawning.\n\nWell, let's start with the good:\n\nPros\n  - Starts up.\n  - Uninstall works.\n\nCons\n  - I had the Viveport version before and it was in Chinese only. Had to uninstall both and reinstall steam version to get English.\n  - Boring combat, consisting of holding your melee weapon in the air and waiting for enemies to collide with it to take damage.\n  - Combat has no feedback whatsoever. You feel disconnected from the \"action\" (or lack thereof) all the time.\n  - (see above) sword/staff/wandplay feels like waving feather dusters at ethereal enemies.\n  - Ranged combat (sorceress/wizard/scantily-clad bimbo only?) works whenever it wants to, and there are no means of aiming.\n  - No sound, other than the \"plong\" menu sound effect. Yes, really. No sound whatsoever from enemies or combat.\n  - Collecting loot is more difficult than defeating enemies.\n  - Uninspired, generic enemies that don't do much other than waddle to you to get killed.\n  - Movement and view direction control seems to work when it wants to. You never know which way you are facing after a teleport.\n  - Weapons are pointing out in a ridiculous angle, instead feeling like a sword hilt they are pointing 45 degrees backwards which destroys any immersion there might ever have been (unlikely).\n\nLooting stuff after defeating the boss sounds straightforward, but in reality it is so much worse.\nYou summon a large chest and throw the stuff enemies drop into it, and they should appear in your arsenal in the \"base\" after you exit the level.\n\nSounds neat, right? Quite simple?\n\nNo. Far from it. The problem is that the chest is deathly afraid to be touched by anything and as soon as you take anything even near it it decides to bounce into sky and fly all over the arena. If you unsummon it and resummon it, the lid will be clipping inside the chest, causing it to float in midair. Which makes tha already fickle thing even more scared of your loot. Trying to throw the items (which is impossible because items just practically drop straight down from your hand) into it makes either the chest or the loot fly 100 meters up in the air and land some time later on the other side of the arena.\n\nThis game is currently broken, and I would not recommend this to anyone. Ever. Not even if it was 99% off. Stay away from this garbage rip-off.\n\n0/10, Unplayable.", "recommendationid": "33305198", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512150", "timestamp_created": 1499331374, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 1105, "playtime_forever": 53, "last_played": 1499330039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997651718"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494611217, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "it's not bad if youre desperate for a game with RPG elements.\n\nIts more about the loot and levelling than combat.\nEnemy designs are pretty nice and there appears to be a large variety of spells and weapons.\n\nIt's got a relaxed pace and not so intense which is sometimes nice in VR.  \nThey need to fix the item box bug though.  It's almost game breaking not being able to reliably drop loot in the item box.  it does work if you keep at it, but sometimes It's so annoying that I just leave all my loot behind :(\n\nThe price is a bit too high.
