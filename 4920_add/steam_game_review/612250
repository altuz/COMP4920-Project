Why? Well there are a few reasons. \n\n1. Bad Aim\nThe aim in this game is atrocious. The gun, while accurate in construction, is extremely hard to use. The aiming reticle is only good for horizontal aiming, meaning that it is very hard to hit headshots, which you need to do to have any chance of beating this game.\n\n2. Hard to kill \nYour character and the opponents seem to have the same amount of health, and it is too much. It takes either a headshot, mentioned earlier, or 3 to 4 body shots. Keep in mind the gun is a five shot. I personally feel that the game would be much more enjoyable if it was easier to kill both yourself and the enemy. This go hand in hand with the AI\u2019s dodging ability, they are able to pull off mid shot dodges with unhuman (duh) reflexes, throwing off your aim in an area where it normally wouldn\u2019t have been disrupted. \n\nMore minor things now:\n\n1. Movement restrictions\nIn the current state of the game if you throw the gun out of the play area you cannot retrieve it.\n\n2. Matches \nYou cannot leave a match besides beating your opponent or restarting the game.\n\n3. Exclusion\nThis game leaves out the left handed community (however small) by only allowing you to draw with your right hand.\n\n4. High noon\nIt is not high noon\n\n5. The holster\nThe holster (at least for me) is directly under the Vive, other wise known as my body\n\nOnce again, this game has huge potential. However right now it has too many \u201cexit points\u201d. I can not wait to see what this game become.\n\nPS I will not be refunding and will rewrite the review in 1-3 months. \n\n\nVideo examples of some of the points https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1KYiavnPGw\n", "recommendationid": "31834302", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511534", "timestamp_created": 1495169098, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 126, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1495167072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198100365660"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498238431, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 11, "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Premise:  You're a gunfighter and up against some scumbags of the old west.  You never move or interact with anything except the occasional jaunt into the bar where you can throw around an NPC, a beer glass and select an opponent to kill.  Don't worry about the amounts of money over their heads since you never actually get that money nor can you spend it on anything anyway.\n\nIf I didn't buy this for $1.19 I would seriously be upset.\n\nPros:  \nThe accuracy of the pistol is pretty good most of the time.\n\nCons:\nDrop your gun outside the interaction box and it's gone.  You have no way of getting it back without closing the game and restarting it. Unfortunately with the wonky controls and gun-grabbing you're likely to do that often...\nThe controls for actually taking your gun are pretty odd.  I found myself trying to stab my crotch with the remote when \"hovering my hand\" over the gun.  It was rather odd placement for a gun holster.\nLow poly graphics.\nNo interaction beyond listening to the guy in front of you curse you out.\n\nThis game is EA, but I don't suspect it's going much further than it already has.  Considering it was released in the beginning of May and hasn't received I haven't seen a patch yet (It's the end of June)\n\nDon't get me wrong, if you like a quick game of \"shoot em up\" and don't mind the quirks, this would be worth the $1.00 price tag.\n\nIf you're looking for a quality game, look elsewhere unless a BUNCH changes between now and its release.", "recommendationid": "32690094", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505433", "timestamp_created": 1498238431, "author": {"num_reviews": 65, "num_games_owned": 4448, "playtime_forever": 7, "last_played": 1498232638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972966291"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498954159, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I kinda like it for some reason", "recommendationid": "33107416", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1498954159, "author": {"num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 569, "playtime_forever": 119, "last_played": 1504049187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198061302571"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496021530, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Wish I knew how to get my money back.", "recommendationid": "32032798", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1496021530, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 16, "last_played": 1495761881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198316756819"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
