Played it a ton when it came out in 2001. At the time I thought the graphics were amazing and the gameplay was brutal - assaults are fast and furious with little room for error. Nowadays I think this may be too complicated for many RTS players since the controls are outdated - playing the larger missions is more tedious than fun because of path finding and unit managements. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1153653727 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1155063729", "recommendationid": "35484955", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525431", "timestamp_created": 1507171864, "author": {"num_reviews": 244, "num_games_owned": 254, "playtime_forever": 403, "last_played": 1506854669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 403, "steamid": "76561198039580049"}, "votes_up": 12}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 15, "total_positive": 13, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
