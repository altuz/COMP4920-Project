Played it a lot as a kid (Still have my hard copy)\nIt still holds up really well with fun factor, and difficulty.\nThe artstyle is very nice, adds to the atmosphere of the game.\nWell worth $6, Compared to the $30 when it was released back then XD\n\nBUT, The game STILL crashes everynow and then....There seems to be an issuee with the US campaign when you start it. It has something to do with Windows 10. I was able to get passed the first mission with a fix I found, but then it crashed again on the 2nd mission.\n\nIt also crashes on the \"Bridge defense* mission in the British campaign.\n10/10 gameplay and fun factor\nbut BEWARE, This game does have some issues with Windows 10, So be prepared for a few crashes (and they are game breaking crashes)", "recommendationid": "34114553", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "timestamp_created": 1502236699, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_forever": 584, "last_played": 1503796024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993292768"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503241668, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Ah, great childhood memories.\nThe game is better than i remember it.", "recommendationid": "34375695", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1503241668, "author": {"num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_forever": 456, "last_played": 1503249320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198161435120"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 11, "total_positive": 10, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
