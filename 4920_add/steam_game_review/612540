If the game is going to be marketed to an audience with modern computers, it should be able to run without excuses about it being old. My problems were resolved by opening the Add/Remove Programs applet, selecting Windows Features, and enabling Legacy Components / Direct Play.\nSudden Strike\u2019s biggest problem is that it is an old game with old game problems. Path finding is horrible, with units often taking the long way around obstacles and exposing themselves to plenty of enemy fire. Tanks bump into each other, and often advance backwards with their weakest face to the enemy. Supply vehicles collide like keystone kops, get confused, and stop resupplying.\nYou\u2019re often are presented with large maps with a lot of units to start with, but it\u2019s never explained that you need to take the objectives in the order listed, or you don\u2019t get reinforcements. The enemy troops mostly sit in defensive positions with artillery, and do a remarkable job of killing a lot of your units before they are winkled out of their foxholes. They receive a seemingly endless supply of Tiger and Panther tanks that are ridiculously hard to kill.\nIn the face of strong German armor and endless troops, you have limited reinforcements that are doled out as you capture objectives. Reinforcements consist of weak armored vehicles and infantry easily mowed down by dug-in defenders. When a group of new troops hit the beach, it\u2019s like being given a $20 bill in a casino and being told to make it last for an hour.\nThe AI is the worst part of the game. In the D-Day mission, you have British allies controlled by the AI that will try to shoot through your American tanks and halftracks if they get between them and their German targets. As far as the enemy AI is concerned, it is utterly atrocious and the developers have compensated by having it cheat shamelessly, giving it endless waves of reinforcements.\nThe campaign missions go on WAY TOO LONG and cease to be fun, becoming tedious and boring. A good game should never stop being fun and become work. \nI thought Men of War / Assault Squad 2 (another game in the same genre) was ridiculous in the way it sent so many AI German troops charging into Allied guns in the first mission, but that game is a jewel by comparison. Buy that instead.\n", "recommendationid": "34702344", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507283", "timestamp_created": 1504413263, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 336, "last_played": 1504241757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993324698"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501407190, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Excuse me, but what is the edition of this release?

That would be my Review for Sudden Strike 3.\n\nI played Suddenstrike 1 & 2 years ago and was searching for old games, that can be played on Notebook. So I decided to buy this game but after I've hit the first mission I was so disappointed. First of all I've salvaged some tanks, that worked perfectly but the soldiers are so f***** slow. After I enlarged my army by 3 tanks, it was time to kill some enemys and get the objectives done... so far so good but here are the reasons, why i would never ever recommend this game:\n\n- the sight ranges of tanks are soooo low\n- even the snipers don't got a really high sight range\n- 3 tanks equipped with MG .50 and all the stuff vs. 3 german soldiers.... 3 minutes later the soldiers are still alive and the enemy got a really high spotting range and is firering on my tanks with everything from everywhere and there is no possibility to spot them, without loosing either my soldiers or my tanks.\n- Tanks don't shoot on enemys with the main gun, as long as they are just soldiers.... WHY??? \"Hey, theres a group of enemys, lets try to kill em with our 0,50 cal.... erm... nope.... no hits yet.... should we maybe try to kill 'em with our main gun?? NOOOOO, that would be to effective vs. a large group of enemys. Let's try to hit 'em with our MG for another minute.... nope, still nothing... hm\"\n\nOn the other hand, some of the missions are quite fun, as long as you get enough reinforcements ;)\n\nGo fuck this game. It sucks. Sudden Strike 1 was awesome, Sudden Strike 2 was awesome and this Sudden Strike sucks. \n\nGuys, better play Ruse, Wargame or even Blitzkrieg or the good old D-Day!", "recommendationid": "33879550", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488646", "timestamp_created": 1501330713, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 19, "last_played": 1504478620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036299239"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 13, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
