If its on sale then also worth a look.\n\nI have two main hobbies, drone flying in real life and VR and I thought this programme could be an excellent best of both worlds. Maybe I am looking in the wrong place and what I want is a drone simulator, but I find the controls annoying. I would prefer an XBOX controller option that allows me to fly the drone like my real life one, so that I dont have to learn all over again, and because I think they are designed how they are for good reason. I also think the position and control of the drone should be important to the firing. The employed mechanism mean you could sit somewhere in a hover and only use the shoot option which then makes it like SPT. You would only need to fly to avoid being hit. If the guns were fixed so you had to aim the drone I think that would be better. Has potential but I think probably not for real drone flyers.", "recommendationid": "31286734", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513889", "timestamp_created": 1492824943, "author": {"num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1492822170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968638558"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493395034, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ok this is interesting. I like it. I actually liked it a lot. Street Fighter kind of feeling with Drones, changing weapons, drones and avatar stuff. These are all good. But what I like most about this game is it is really different. I guess you have to try it to see. But let me try to explain a bit.\n\nYou don't control the drone like other flying plane or spaceship games, But you don't control it as real life drone either (actually you can, there is an option for flying like real life drone, but I found that diffucult) They used motion controllers in a good way. I liked it. You hold trigger and bend your hand to fly around and click up and down to go up and down. First time you try it is very weird, because I didn't try controllers like this. But after keep playing a bit. You are getting it. It is fun.\n\nReal diffuculty is other controller. So one hand control the drone, other hand has a target/laser thing. with that you keep shooting enemy drone. Using one controller to fly and other to shoot is very interesting. It's really diffucult but you are learning quickly. I got better and better in like half an hour or so.\n\nI couldn't find online games, I guess because this game just released. So I will give it time to try online, but they have enough solo stuff for now.\n\nIt is something different and it has real potantial to become something bigger than what it is now. \n\nI want to see more arenas (there are only 3) and more players online. Otherwise it is good.\n", "recommendationid": "31419085", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1493395034, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 55, "last_played": 1493396076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198296887989"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494510429, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I am new to VR games, and this is a great one to start with.

But it was me controlling things - an awesome experience. Took a little time to get the movement controls down, but with a little patience was able to start controlling drone movement just fine using the default methodology.

It's not everything I was promised, but it's also not Bladerunner, so I suppose I should be grateful.\n\nThis game, however, is everything I was promised.  I woggle one stick, and the drone zooms off to port and starboard like a spry galleon.  I press the circle pad thing down, and my faithful drone sinks into the depths like a rather less spry galleon.  I press up, and it ascends, a trick which even the spryest galleon struggles with.  If you've ever wanted to move in three dimensions, this is pretty much your chance.\n\nAs for the fighting part of drone fighter - I grew up playing Specter on an enormous grey Macintosh, so there's something nostalgic about shooting hollow green glowing cubes while shouting obscenities at uncooperative hardware.  Maybe you had to be there, but if you were, you can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the terrifying red pyramids of Specter are nowhere to be seen here.  If you've ever wanted to shoot stuff with a laser pointer, well, you didn't need to wait for VR, but this adds another dimension to the experience.\n\nIt must be said, in fairness, that this game has its moments which make you question the existence of a just and loving God.  All the moments in which you have to fly through hoops come exquisitely to mind, as do the periods of mournfully gazing about the ceiling, trying to discern whether my vehicular companion is hovering right above me, or has simply buzzed off to another world where the are neither hoops nor spiky red balls it isn't supposed to shoot no matter how much they deserve it.\n\nThere's enough in it, and it's competently enough executed, to justify calling it a game, rather than an upsy-downy-vroom-vroom simulator.  There's not enough to call it a sensory or narrative extravaganza, but that's why you're buying it, slightly on sale, for ten dollars, instead of pre-ordering Mass Effect Andromeda and then shrieking incoherently for three weeks.\n\nEnjoy.", "recommendationid": "31512663", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1493755599, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 639, "playtime_forever": 931, "last_played": 1493765872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006640250"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494001148, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very cool game and very difficult.
