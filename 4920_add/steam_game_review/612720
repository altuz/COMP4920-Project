Most of the questions I had myself and found others asking are answered in the tutorial (this cannot be overstated). I played through 40+ hours without going through the tuturial, and based on others' questions I believe they did as well but it was all unnecessary as most confusion was cleared up by simply playing through the tutorial. The developers have done an excellent job at intermingling several different genres into a single title, however, there is a learning curve (again go through the tutorial) but it is extremely rewarding overall. This game is very promising for early access, it is intricate and has longevity that many others fall short of. This game is easily a five star in my book and hopefully the development team keeps in mind the same spirit, moving forward, that brought us this initial but amazing release.", "recommendationid": "34850200", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537437", "timestamp_created": 1505004746, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 55, "playtime_forever": 10009, "last_played": 1507095207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1952, "steamid": "76561198012154799"}, "votes_up": 22}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504902837, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Potential.... lots of Potential.\n\nAs a fan of the The Guild series you can see clearly where the game is going, however, it is still far from completion.
