But this is just not good.\n\nThe good things about this game are that it looks good and the music is nice. That's about it.\n\nOther than that, I'll summarize the game: you start the game, the game gives you 2 pages about a bland story, then the game starts. You have no idea who are the characters you're using or why are they fighting because the story is really THAT vague. After that, you just type words from a selection of 3 words to attack your enemy. You have to defeat the enemy before a 10 seconds counter or your party gets hit and after a certain number of stages, there is a boss fight. After you charge the special bar, you get an extra word that heals the party when activated. You just keep going from fight to fight. There's no story in between fights or anything else - something like resting in a tavern to check on your party, equip items, choose who you want to take on your party next, assign points to skills or attributes... Nothing. It's just one battle after the other.\n\nThere is an elemental reference showing up at the corner of the screen, showing which element is strong against a certain element, as monsters and your characters have an element assigned to them - attacking the monster with its element deals little damage and attacking the monster with its weak element deals high damage. The problem with this system is that most of the time, you're not really paying attention to elements, you're just trying to type words as quickly as possible, which is actually more effective if you're a fast typer than just using specific elements.\n\nSpeaking of being a fast typer... The game has no difficulty selection. If you're not a fast typer, you're going to be defeated very easily.\n\nThe party levels up as monsters are defeated. When you die, you then start over from the beginning, but the party's level remains. I'm not yet entirely sure what this changes in the game, but I'm assuming your party causes more damage and takes less damage, which would then allow you to progress a little further into the game each time you play.\n\nDon't get me wrong - as a typing game, it works decently well. It's when we consider the RPG elements that the game falls short and ends up just being an average typing game. Maybe the game's story progresses further on, but sadly the game is so lackluster that it doesn't encourage me to keep trying.", "recommendationid": "33425553", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514035", "timestamp_created": 1499675798, "author": {"num_reviews": 102, "num_games_owned": 4292, "playtime_forever": 315, "last_played": 1499674783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014445897"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
