It looked like such a quirky game, and I saw it's on sale for just under $5. So I decided to play just a little, and I ended up playing through the arcade mode in one sitting, and having a lot of fun. The roster of the game is good, plenty of character options, and everyone plays unique from each other. There's also a menu that has bios for each character, which is useful since there are some Gods that I didn't know about, like the Chinese god of war, for example. I played using the Hori fighting commander controller, and it was very good for this game, I had no problems with the default controller input. The only real bugs I noticed were on the menu, sometimes it can feel a little unresponsive, like changing the resolution to 1920x1080, pressing right many times, then it changes and makes the click of the button sound for as many times as I mashed the button. Thankfully, in combat, everything feels responsive and doesn't feel like there's a lag or delay to your attacks. Back to arcade mode, I played as Athena, and I think already, I've found my main. She plays like a hyrbid of Wonder Woman and Aquaman in the first Injustice, pretty much take WW's sword/shield mode but replace the sword with Aquaman's trident, and that's how she plays. It only took a few matches on very easy mode to get the hang of her moves, and they do have the full move set on the pause menu. The game goes from very easy to very hard, and on very easy, I never lost two rounds, so it's as welcoming to any player skill level as you want. Casual to hardcore challenge. So far on this build, there aren't individual character endings, but I'd imagine later they'll have text endings, because they do have bios already, so it seems like they have an idea of a little more post game story planned. The game does look really nice, very detailed character models, faces never change expression, but that's fine. Each character has their own very detailed background, very much like classic Street Fighter. As for the game play, I would say it feels the most like Samurai Showdown IV, a little slow paced, like floating jumps, but it never feels sluggish or anything, and of course the weapon based combat. There's also very easy to string together and flow combos, which does remind me of Killer Instinct. For an indie fighting game, it does have nice polish to it, in it's current state. Not flawless, but a very good value for the price, because you do get plenty of content, take that Street Fighter V! It does have some completionist incentives. Every God has 2 skins to start with and 4 to unlock, plus it does look as if the final boss is an unlock, probably by beating the game as every God. It does have plenty to do on single player, and it does have 2 player mode.", "recommendationid": "34869653", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482184", "timestamp_created": 1505072094, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 407, "playtime_forever": 103, "last_played": 1505181670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045457700"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505095361, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 7, "review": "Oh hell yes!\n\nFun game.\n\n10/10 Because I can see Buddha fight Jesus.\n\nNeeds Cthluhu.", "recommendationid": "34874904", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519368", "timestamp_created": 1505095361, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 80, "playtime_forever": 217, "last_played": 1505175995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198095807693"}, "votes_up": 14}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504802544, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 24, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 56, "review": "if jesus was as cool irl as he is in this game i'd believe in him", "recommendationid": "34798007", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519689", "timestamp_created": 1504802544, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 78, "playtime_forever": 95, "last_played": 1504566071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198137766183"}, "votes_up": 40}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504589031, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bought this for the memes, but actually ended up with a fairly satisfying fighter.  It's gameplay is surprisingly fun. It feels almost like a slower KoF XIV to me. Some of the specials are lackluster (Sif's DP motion), and while I can definitely see the potential in some character's kits, sometimes it seems like the devs don't know how to make the moves interact with eachother (Odin). Another comment would be that the magic series doesn't seem to work with some characters because their normals are stubby (specifically Sif's M).\n\nCombo damage seems very high, which is not a bad thing. For instance, with Jesus I was able to find a 50-60% combo within about 15 minutes of picking him up. If I had to compare it to something else in this regard, I'd probably call it similar to street fighter 2. Scaling seems a little wonky too, but they can fix that in a balance patch.\n\nThe game has two meters, a super gauge and a DPS meter.  The super gauge is only used for your super, and the DPS meter is essentially a V-trigger from SFV. I'm really hoping that, as the development of the game goes on, they create additional uses for these meters, as right now options feel kind of limited.\n\nOverall, I really like this game. It's definitely not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to following this game and seeing where the devs take it.
