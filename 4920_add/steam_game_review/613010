Watch my gameplay revealing the complete game and discussing the hidden messages with my moderators here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwlbITdiFeI\n\nIt took me livestreaming it and two of my moderators who are pretty smart helping me to get through it.  I think I had it about 98% complete an hour and a half into it, but when you lose all your \"chances\", you have to start completely over and do it all again.  All in all, it took me just over four hours to completely solve it, but the story itself is only maybe ten minutes long.  I'm sure that some people will be able to beat this in much shorter time periods, especially if they have seen it played before (as in my video above)\n\nI do believe this is a great game and value for it offers the player hidden inspirational and pretty deep messages about love, relationships, and 'letting go\".  The music is also beautiful, as is the black and white art found within the game.\n\nIt's not perfect however, and the biggest problem I had is a complete lack of options, both sound and graphic resolutions, as well as a missing option anywhere to exit the game, forcing you to ALT-F4 to exit the game as even the ESC will not work.  Still, it scored an impressive 86% on my scoring table, and the low price tag and high value helped it achieve that score on my table.\n\nHighly recommended.  It's a beautiful little game with deep messages if you are patient enough to complete the full game.", "recommendationid": "32582967", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517420", "timestamp_created": 1497930952, "author": {"num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "playtime_forever": 248, "last_played": 1497910421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053422627"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497885067, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 12, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Its a very interesting game. it's kinda like a visual novel, but with gameplay elements. graphically its very nice and the music matches that very well. if i could take things seriously i would probably like it alot more. but for the price it seems like an ok story game.\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0dkJTHWh-8&feature=youtu.be", "recommendationid": "32567709", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473423", "timestamp_created": 1497885067, "author": {"num_reviews": 103, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 20, "last_played": 1497881791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036777325"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
