No, the game isn't that hard to figure out, but ask me what the power-ups do and I honestly couldn't tell you. Most of the times I just try to connect them with the other tiles, obviously, and it triggers several combos. It usually takes several tries to finish a level. A tutorial is A MUST.\nAnother thing that bothered me is that if I notice things aren't going my way, I normally ike to retry a level. There's no button for this. There's only a pause button. So in the end I have to click up to 20-30 times in order to restart a level. This definitely needs to be implemented.\nAlso, the text is a bit blurry, even on extremely high quality. If the developer can fix it, it will look smashing. I like the slowmotion endings, they look really cool.\nNow, would I recommend this game ? Yes and no. If none of my complaints is fixed, then no.
