This game takes place on the Eastern Front of the Second World War between the Germans and the Russians from 1941 to 1945.  I really enjoy this game. You play has both the Germans and the Russians in different campaigns in the game.  I think that you get a lot of content for the price of this game.  I also think that they also have a pretty good Tutorial Campaign in the game which teaches you all the basic stuff you need to know to play the game.\n\nI also like this game because it is a lot of just point and click with your mouse to move your units around and to get your units to fight.  I can zoom in and out on the maps real easy with my mouse wheel.  I can also use my mouse to move around on the maps.\n\nI hope that HexWar Games make more of these kind of games to play on the PC in the future along with their Civil War series of games which I also really enjoy playing. \n\n", "recommendationid": "30862498", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533875", "timestamp_created": 1490996864, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 133, "playtime_forever": 348, "last_played": 1491593378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970510452"}, "votes_up": 22}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502164146, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A simplified smaller version of Panzer Corps but a lot of fun, annoyingly half the time I play when I beat a level it will freeze up.  A simple ctrl+alt+delete and task manager then end tank battle takes me out.  If you can be bothered dealing with that annoying glitch I'd say pick it up maybe on sale, like Tank Battle: North Africa I'm enjoying my time with it.  One of those easy to play games that don't require a lot of time or stress.", "recommendationid": "34094951", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1502164146, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 149, "playtime_forever": 226, "last_played": 1503805075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198231810204"}, "votes_up": 0}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
