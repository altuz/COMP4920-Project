It's quite the steal for $2, and is definitely worth the suggested price of $2.99.  This is a must buy. [u] I played this on the Oculus Rift with Touch conrollers and gameplay was smooth.[/u]\n\nBasically you're fighting not waves, but hordes of zombies chasing after you across a decent sized map.  Movement is by joystick forward or backward and turning can be done by physically turning IRL and you can also move strafing right or left by pushing down on joystick right or left (have to click down).  You can also do swinging arms + grip to move if you want but I don't recommend that as the zombies will chase you all over and you need quick and precise movement.\n\nYou can dual wield small guns (handguns) or single wield biggers guns (ARs, etc.) and there's lots of of guns to test out on the zombies.  You unlock weapons by leveling up when you kill enough zombies.  There's day and night environments and I believe a total of 4 different enviroments.  There's big zombies, spitting zombies, really fast zombies, and normal zombies.  They are lego type zombies and they have all kinds of uniform dress ups.\n\nEither way, it doesn't matter.  Either the idea of running around avoiding zombies while killing as many as you can appeals to you or not.  And it appeals to me :D\n\nRate 7/10 great mindless fun for the price and very small download", "recommendationid": "35050586", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498218", "timestamp_created": 1505759266, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 845, "playtime_forever": 52, "last_played": 1505791599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 7, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
