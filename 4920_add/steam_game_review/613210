I played the game for maybe ten minutes and fell in love with it. It wasn't until after I played it with someone else that I realized what a treasure I'd purchased.\n\nAbout Single Player:\nThe single player mode is a series of puzzles. You can earn one to three stars on each puzzle. In order to get those stars, you have to get each mouse into the hole that's provided. Cats are on each level. If the cat eats one mouse or gets stuck in the hole, you have to start the puzzle over. You are provided with more arrows than are necessary to complete the puzzle. If you use the least amount of arrows necessary to complete the puzzles, you are given three stars and an in-game sticker.\n\nAbout Multiplayer:\nThe multiplayer is based around a game called ChuChu Rocket. Two or more players use the same board and try to collect mice that spawn. Different events happen that can make that collection easier or harder. Each player can place arrows nearly anywhere on the board. Only three arrows remain active for each player. If a fourth is placed, the earliest arrow placed by that player is erased.\n\nThere are three different multiplayer game modes. Each one provides different challenges for players.\n\nPros:\n- The controls are easy for the controller: one thumbstick moves the cursor and the other places arrows in the designated directions.\n- The puzzles are enjoyable but challenging if you want all the stars.\n- Multiplayer is completitive and fun!\n- Local and online multiplayer.\n- The art is cute and seemless.\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer can only be played with human players. There is no CPU option.\n- Screen can sometimes be a little too busy in multiplayer modes.\n- There's a limited number of multiplayer maps. While there is some variety, I'd like to see more, if that's somehow possible. If community made levels or custom levels are possible, that would be fine. I would gladly make my own levels.\n\nI'm definitely going to be pouring more hours into this, so review may be altered a little overtime, especially if updates are continued.", "recommendationid": "34848829", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506518", "timestamp_created": 1504998773, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 391, "playtime_forever": 76, "last_played": 1505200795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120437431"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
