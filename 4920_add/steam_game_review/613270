Dinosis is 5 bucks so i figured i'd give it a shot and my opinon is simple: It is NOT a bad game. The reasons why i still can't recommend it are simple (from minor to big):\n-The voice acting\n-Flaws with the engine (beard dissapears and appears at the campfire, stairs aren't accessable whithout jumping, etc.)\n-Sometimes the subtitles doesn't even say what the character is saying\n-Whether this guy is just VERY hungry or the hunger system is slightly off but you are even hungy after eating a whole \nt-rex\n-Dinosaurs like the ankylosaurus should not be able to walk through narrow spaces\n-Dinosaurs aren't acting like they should (herbovoirs attacking you on sight, raptors hunting alone, etc.)\n-bugs/glitches: pretty much what got me to quit the game to name a few: got eaten by a dead t-rex, got stuck between stairs and a corpse, ankylo bashed me in a house and i couldn't get out again\n\nTo be honest it feels more like an early access title but if you are ok with starting a game over and over because of bugs and glitches it could be enjoyable to the point you killed every dinosaur atleast once.", "recommendationid": "35369180", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1506844005, "author": {"num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 85, "last_played": 1506842470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "steamid": "76561198093571585"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504706035, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "the first thing I haft to say about this game is that maybe yes it's cheap, but this is my opinion so sit down kids and let me talk you through this game\n\nthis game is literally the worst dinosaur game I've ever played, well second worse, it's still better than PCE (that isn't a compliment though), but my point is that it's broken, buggy, but it's kinda bad in a good way, you really shouldn't buy it (should be a free game really) but its balancing just so perfectly on a so bad its good level in terms of the environment being very occasionally so.\n\nthe voice acting is lazy and sounds like the voice actor can't be asked half the time, like he's really not interested, the models are buggy and don't look right or glitch out on kill, the animations are broken and really don't seem to have that much time put into them, just to skim over that quickly.\n\nanother thing I have a problem is seemingly having to extinct the entire raptor population to get a few bars of hunger, yes that's an exaggeration but you haft to kill a lot to refill even half your hunger, the mechanic isn't bad since most survival story games don't really have that very often but it could still be so much better and fixed to a point where it does not take so damn much to have full hunger.\n\none thing good about this game is the constructed and visible scenery, I know it's not that HD and cinematic but I kinda like and can appreciate the look and style of it.\n\nthe story is why I cannot recommend this game, it hints at being such a perfect and constructed story, not many dino games have backstory that's visible (only Jurassic Park clone games, but they ARE Jurassic park clones) but this game kinda made me feel it could have a deep and interesting story, it was as I said hinting on something deep and interesting, why is this guy here, why did their plane crash-\n\n[!!!!SPOILER FOR STORY PAST THIS POINT!!!! what little there is of it]\n\n-in the future? why are there dinos, what are these weather- oh wait, you are robbed of all that BY A STUPID CLICHE 'ITS A TRAP' ENDING!!!, but still there was hope even past that originally when I saw that it was a trap at the end, when the loading screen came up I was interested to see what would happen next, after the loading screen, what I could possibly be caught for? maybe some sorta revenge? but no, just a 'the end' screen and pretty much a very unsatisfactory and terrible ending to a actually good concept for a story, it just ruined and wasted the great opportunity, I felt cheated, like everything I had done was a waste of time, I made no impact to the universe and felt like I left before I really even begun, I also learned jack s*** about the world except for it being the future and that nature had reclaimed the land with dinosaurs for some reason roaming. \n\nI'm sorry developer but you need to do better, this story and the ending that robs you of finding it out in any form just really ruins the game, I ask you to make something of an extension to this game or a remake with a longer story with a ton of time and effort, the scenery isn't even that bad, the models and glitches are somewhat passable (but would also need a lot of work) but the terrible presentation of the story and the way it is really stolen from you before you get a chance to really actually get into any of it is really bad and dissapointing, and personally what makes me despise this game as a whole product.\n\nthe game has some interesting ideas and could become a great story if you just put a lot more time and effort into them, and help make the player emerged and deep into a great story and universe, I really hate seeing wasted potential in dinosaur games cause the only good ones we ever get are Jurassic park clones, (well only one made by Telltale have I seen some actual good story in) and other than that one product all dinosaur games are basic survival with claimed story or just complete flops.", "recommendationid": "34775659", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502876", "timestamp_created": 1504704936, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_forever": 239, "last_played": 1504691168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068533775"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 40, "total_positive": 26, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
