I hope that they are going to add some other activity happening in the casino. Some other players at the tables, people at slots, etc. I would also love to see using hand gestures to hit or stand instead of the menu. Being able to actually place your cheques to bet instead of using the menu would be more immersive. I didn't see a way to reset your position, so I had to place chair exactly where the chair in the game is, maybe i missed the setting for this? I really like how realistic the casino environment looks. This game has potential and I hope they keep developing it.", "recommendationid": "31677138", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1494476482, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_forever": 31, "last_played": 1494473557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056244759"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493629926, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Still basically a beta.\n\nEncountered some AI bugs. while I can't give it a thumbs up yet the dev's are watching so if your interested in providing feedback and ideas to help shape the game give it a try.", "recommendationid": "31460797", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505968", "timestamp_created": 1493549587, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_forever": 3422, "last_played": 1494577295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042292660"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505078969, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Edit: All the bugs I knew of have been fixed.
