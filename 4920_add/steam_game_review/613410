Can I make this full-screen?\"\n\nI furiously searched for the options menu and it was no where to be found. I pressed ALT-ENTER, nothing. Okay, let's keep going.\n\nI created my character then found myself in what I figured was the Town HUB.\n\n\"Hey, there's the menu button!\" *click* nothing *click click* nothing happens.\n\nTurns out you need to complete the tutorial before you can access any in-game options. *sigh* \n\nThe tutorial was surprisingly decent -- teaching me how to equip and enhance loot, trying out different character skills, etc. However, I quickly learned navigating menus and inventory panels was infuriating. The tutorial failed to properly teach combat and all the keys, although I eventually figured it out -- later to learn the keys could not be changed.\n\nTutorial finished, on to a scenario -- fought some baddies, leveled up, and gained a couple skills. All the while loot is dropping everywhere, but there's an odd 2-second delay between picking up each item, making looting a slow and painful process in what is supposed to be a fast-paced Action RPG.\n\nFirst impressions are everything, and Delphinia Chronicle was a major disappointment, even at its affordable price point.\n\nGet me out of here. Uninstalled.

You copycat Dungeon fighter for literally everything except the controls, and in place of it you add this??? And I can't change it at all?

Also whats the point when you can just get all your endgame weapons with cash?\n\nNo reason to play over Dungeon Fighter, why isnt this early acess? It's ethier terrible or incomplete.

Take, for example, the character\u2019s skills are shown in round button (I literally want to touch my monitor to cast the spell), but instead you figure out you should press 3, 4, 5, 6 on your keyboard. Same thing goes to the menu and all the sub menu.\n\nThe graphics, judging from a PC game point of view, looks weird to me in a way that even though the surroundings, characters, and enemies are all in one screen, there isn\u2019t many interactions between them, and it gives me the feeling of stiffing when it comes to the combat system. It is further penalized by the poor/low frame drawing; the animation is not smooth.\n\nI do want to say that I only played this game for only 10 mins in scenario mode, however it should give me a rough idea what I am getting into.
