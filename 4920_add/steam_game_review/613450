If you are someone that has suffered anxiety, stress, depression, or a mental illness in general you are going to have a deep connection to this game. As somone who has suffered from depression and anxiety for a very long time I can say that this game hits home...it hit's home in a way that is deep, raw, and unfiltered. It's a summary of what it is like to deal with these issues on a day to day basis. Some of the struggles, the energy that is needed to accomplish tasks, loss, nagging thoughts/emotions, and the frailty of it all. It is a game that is going to make you feel. Cough cough I ugly cried cough cough.\n\nThe controls are simple walking around. Left, right, up, and down. Some clicking here and there. There isn't a lot of \"gameplay\". You are along for the story.\n\nIf you have played other story rich indie games like Night in the Woods or The Beginners Guide this is in the same vein.\n\nWould I recommend Please Knock on My Door? I've played through it twice and plan to keep playing for quite a bit more. I would absolutely recommend it\n\n\nEdit: I think the best way to play this game the first time is \"The experience\", after that probably \"The Story\", and then \"The Game\". Really \"The Experience\" feels more like a sim where as the others just give you a bit too much information via \"stats\"", "recommendationid": "34807791", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566040", "timestamp_created": 1504844986, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 190, "last_played": 1505442749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054635369"}, "votes_up": 34}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504867875, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great plot with a some thrilling twists and turns. I strongly recommend playing \"The Game\" and not \"The Story\" as your first playthrough, as The Game offers more of a challenge and perhaps the more real experience. I played The Story afterwards to skip the restrictions. I did not try \"The Experience\" yet.\n\nGameplay is a bit like Sims but more mundane IN A GOOD WAY, if that makes sense. You have to min/max your choices and will often have to choose the lesser evil. It's a lot about figuring out what's the right way to go about a problem, and what gameplay strategy you have (long term good health for better late game or feel good now to have a good day at work, but probably feel bad at late game?)\n\nNever been depressed myself but lived with someone who was, and I recognize a lot of the feelings and arguments in the game. I think everyone should try stepping in the shoes of someone being down, which this game does a great job of.\n\nPros\n-Excellent voice work and music\n-Engaging story with a (sometimes) rewarding climax\n-Fun gameplay while being about a serious topic\n-Great replayability\n\nCons\n-\"The Story\"-mode might be misleading as first playthrough\n-No chapter select (Try different answer at the end = replay game)\n\nI strongly recommend this game to everyone, great work.", "recommendationid": "34811848", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530056", "timestamp_created": 1504867875, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_forever": 202, "last_played": 1505222773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035683104"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504938297, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I played through this game twice. The first time was with the numbers hidden while they still affect your choices; the second time was with the numbers on but still affecting your choices.\n\nAt the end of my first playthrough, I felt absolutely broken as if I'd never be happy again. As someone who can relate to the overall theme of the game, I thought I'd do a better job of taking care of the MC. Oops. In comparison to my my second playthrough, my fortitude levels were absolutely abysmal my first time through. I did too much and overextended the MC, and things I thought would affect me negatively actually affected me positively and vice versa.\n\nIf you go through the game blind, read through all the text and the various scenes, you'll probably get a solid 2+ hours out of the game. I highly recommend playing The Experience mode, where you can't see how your actions affect the MC until it's time to make a decision.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, although considering how I felt at the end of my first playthrough perhaps \"enjoyed\" isn't the right word. The narrative makes it incredibly easy to empathize (or sympathize) with the MC. It can be frustrating (in a good way!) to see things unfold from an outsider's perspective, where you have an idea of how Will, Amy and Jenny really feel but the MC may not always see the reality of their feelings because of the situation the MC is in.\n\nReally, it was such a gem. I absolutely loved the narrator, and somehow the second act took me by surprise.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say is about the small handful of grammatical errors here and there. Their presence sometimes pulled me out of the game for a moment or two, but it wasn't anything absolutely terrible. One more readthrough of the game's script by the dev probably wouldn't hurt, though.\n\ntl;dr I went in expecting to play a game with a depressed MC knowing how it would probably end, tried to make good choices, ended up making bad choices but loved every minute of the game anyway!", "recommendationid": "34830308", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520962", "timestamp_created": 1504938297, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 187, "playtime_forever": 257, "last_played": 1505674610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198151976494"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505153665, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A very real and heavy game, but still entertaining.
