You can't even call it trash metaphorically because it is literally made out of random pictures with no consistency. Even the trailer for the game said - Buy this game......Bitch. Well, now I have to see what the game is about. It is very refreshing to see a game that is so aware of its stench ( I do not recommend it to anyone but I love it )\n\nThe first boss is a wizard who wears supremacy robes.You can't help wondering what else is there and the game does not disappoint. This is a good game sort of like NES Dr.jekyll and Mr.hyde is good. It is only enjoyable because it is unbearably bad.\n\nTechnically speaking it falls under a Metroidvania format because it has backtracking, platforming and cell based map (using that term very lightly) The big exception is the fact that Silver Island has a lot of horizontal walking and limited vertical platforming. Surprisingly it actually has some content.I am 5 hours in and only about a third way through the game. There are many melee and ranged weapons some of which are hidden inside secret areas. Not much in terms of moves and shoots tend to go through the enemies most of the time.\n\nSave system is rather helpful since you can save inside the save building or from inventory. The inventory itself is not as awful as I expected. You can't do much in terms of options. No gamepad, full screen or remapping controls.\n\nPlatforming, combat, and controls are not good. Still, I don't actually mind it because the game feels so motivating in terms of randomness and grinding. Some enemies are pixel art and other are cut off from images. Same goes for environment and animation. You just can't predict what will game show you next. Will it be a turd monster or Jason with a chainsaw? There is a lot to explore but I find it a little difficult to navigate. \n\nExcept for that nice song in the trailer I think it has decent music and use of sound effects. I can't be certain if the soundtrack was specifically made for this game but I actually enjoy it. Most areas have its own theme and there are several genres. \n\n[h1] Rating 5/10 [/h1] I can't recommend a game like this because I take game mechanics seriously. However, if you looking for something remarkably bad, I think it is hilarious. Maybe I have a dumb sense of humor but personally, I got my $2 back in laughs. Horrible in most aspects but I do find it amusing.", "recommendationid": "33682542", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499298", "timestamp_created": 1500588091, "author": {"num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 324, "last_played": 1503369387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
