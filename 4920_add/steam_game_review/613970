Not only is the text hysterical to read due to god awful English translations, but the controls don't respond beyond the left mouse button for attack and right mouse button to walk. You also get slammed with hordes of enemies and higher level foes out of nowhere. At one point I was on the character screen upgrading, I died, and played the game with zero health and invicibility. Didn't help any because I got swarmed by one horde of higher level enemies after another. I saved and quit the game and when I chose continue it restarted everyhing but didn't respawn the bear for the very first quest so I couldn't continue, as well as kept my level but not my upgrade points or even the points I spent.\n\nUnless you intend to finish this game in one sitting, you're not going to finish it. Until the developer fixes these problems, it's best to save your money. It's a shame because it's not the worst Unity game that looks like it uses a ton of assets in an action rpg I've played (could be wrong, just basing it on looks), but even when (and if) the repairs are made it still won't be anything of great interest unless massive upgrades are implemented and quick to make it stand out as more than a generic looking title.", "recommendationid": "31965054", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515187", "timestamp_created": 1495772959, "author": {"num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 3292, "playtime_forever": 48, "last_played": 1495772053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025037510"}, "votes_up": 14}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495808742, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1495821045, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "developer_response": "Thanks for your review, it was very enlightening for us! Our game was made to be difficult, but we understand that the enemies are OP, and we are working as fast as possible in balancing.\nThe motion command is all mouse-based, so there are no intentions of AWSD commands. You can rotate the camera by pressing the scroll button, and pick up the items on the floor with the A key as described in the help icon in the upper right corner.\nAbout the cave music, there really is no music, but there is a characteristic ambient sound.", "review": "Video Review\nhttps://youtu.be/-qCBNFWfJD4\n\nIn it's current state i can not recommend this game to anyone here are the resons why.\nThe Music just stops when entering a cave.\nThe enemys just rush you and most of them are OP so together there a nightmare.\nyou can't use WASD to direct youself you are limited to right click.\nThe path fineding it terrible you will find yourself running into walls and fences a lot.\nthere is no objective markers or indercation on the map where to go for more quests.\nAnd many more but some are just very picky i know.\n\nBut given all that it is still a very new game so Fingers crossed the dev improves it over time as it dose have a good foundation.\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "31974401", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490405", "timestamp_created": 1495808742, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1495803504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198307180354"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
