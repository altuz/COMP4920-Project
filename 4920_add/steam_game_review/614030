That is putting it nice. It does not stop there, however.\nThere are a few minor problems, for example that your music stops for a short while each time you get hit, that either input is not always recognized or there is some weird and inconsistend cooldown for your shooting without that being represented anywhere in the UI or how terrible navigation is when choosing a song, and a bug (Multiple times when I tried fighting a boss both him and me would be stuck with the music playing while we both could not do anything, which was the only one I encountered in ~30 minutes though.).\nOn their own, these would not be terrible, however they do add up.\nAnd while I would be willing to forgive the game for all of these and be left with a product that while not terrible does not bring anything thrilling to the table and is only worth a look for the niche genre I mentioned earlier, there is a total dealbreaker for me.\nThe music is weirldy distorted when incorporated into the game.\nI have absolutely no idea what went wrong, but in this game, all my music sounds very weird, some songs more than others. There seem to be no options to tweak sound quality in this game and outside, everything is perfectly normal.\nMaybe this is due to my taste focusing on Metal and it works well with other genres, but that kills it for me. I'm afraid I will refund this despite its low price since I know that I will never touch it again in this state and don't expect it to be fixed as I appear to be the only one with this issue.\nTry it out if you are interested as a lot of people seem to very much enjoy it and see for yourself if you have any issues.", "recommendationid": "32877034", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522389", "timestamp_created": 1498589744, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 275, "playtime_forever": 33, "last_played": 1498589095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071182392"}, "votes_up": 12}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491787815, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "To be completely honest this is one of my favorite games and the price is insanely low for such a great time consumer.
