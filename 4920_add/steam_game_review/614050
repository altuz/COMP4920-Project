The \"strategy\" aspect of the game which is supposed to remind you of heroes is instead an automated battle in which you have very little control besides casting a little spell every once in a while. This feels like a tug of war game without the tug of war part, strategy is more or less out the window and combat is more about throwing as many units into the fray as possible- Which isn't much because the devs decided that, instead of having units take up a given value, it would be a good idea to have every unit type have their own individual cap based on how strong they are. This means that, instead of a \"strong\" unit taking up a certain amount of your total supply, you can only have x number of that unit based on your current stats. \n\nThe other aspects are also lacking, any sense of empire maintaining is non-existent even compared to the heroes series which was already barebones in that aspect. Instead of crafting units you exclusively get more units by just hiring them at buildings located around the map for gold that you find laying around (you do get an income but it is negligible considering how little you get for how much time it takes to send you more). The plot is minimal and doesn't receive any input during playing. It's basically the same level of plot that early super mario games offered (i.e. Hey look, the princess is kidnapped! Let's go wander around and do shit I guess\").\n\nOverall: Not a terrible game but very underwhelming in every aspect.", "recommendationid": "31031890", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504241", "timestamp_created": 1491710998, "author": {"num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 362, "playtime_forever": 50, "last_played": 1491711489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044873014"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491676112, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "5/10 not enough content only 1 story that takes 35 minutes to beat\n\n", "recommendationid": "31023533", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499320", "timestamp_created": 1491676112, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 60, "last_played": 1491676062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054702826"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
