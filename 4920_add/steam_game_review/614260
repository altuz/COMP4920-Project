I have to say I really like the look of it at such an early stage. Like many of the reviews I can say I really wasn't a fan of the 3rd person locomotion, but it rumours are true and they have/are working on changing that then it will be music to my ears!\n\nI found from my first play through that some of the key sounds were missing that you would expect... like the sound of swinging a sword. To be honest I think the sounds need quite a bit of work at this stage, but granted it is early access.\n\nIts a great Dungeon crawler game and much more suited for adults than most other entries on VR at the moment. Haven't played too much but love how many spaces there seem to be in the inventory for different weapons. At the time of writing this I have only found the Sword/Shield/Crossbow. \n\nAgain like some other review I really was getting a little agitated at how long it takes to reload the crossbow, I was stuck on one section for what seemed like an eternity because of this.\n\nBut overall at this early stage I think its going to be a great game to keep an eye on!

Even the movement system has been 'fixed' to removed the avatar, as mentioned in the latest update.\n\nBut as a game (even early access), it is really lacking and needs more than a pretty wrapping and some simple-minded zombies to fight. Here are some points for improvement:\n\n-Add some kind of back story and incentive to crawl thorough the dungeon\n\n-Teleport cool down is randomly broken, taking too long to reactivate\n\n-Please add a more conventional approach to teleportation, by always showing the teleport overlay on the ground where your controller is pointing, and activate the teleport with a single click of the track button\n\n-Level 2 has randomly collapsing bricks with an unrealistically short reaction time; this level is so frustrating, I stopped playing here\n\n-add interactive items in the world, even if they serve only as junk items to smash or toss; adds to the immersion\n\n-crossbows are not laser beams; add a parabolic trajectory", "recommendationid": "34337192", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1503092218, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 136, "last_played": 1505096495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987289348"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505633197, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I think whoever did the graphics is extremely talented.  The whole world looks very beautiful and the atmosphere is perfect.  There was an area/room with a blue flame reflecting in a pool of water in front of it, and it was so beautiful and immersive that I just kept staring at it for some time admiring the beauty of it.\n\nBut many other aspects of the game need to be improved.  I noticed the devs being responsive and open to changes, so it might all work out in the future.\n\nPRO\n\n-   absolutely stunning graphics!!  (But I think you need at least a 1080 currently?)\n\n-   perfect atmosphere!\n\n\nCON\n\n-   the inventory interface is really bad.  It's confusing and difficult to store/grab objects. Also buggy (couldn't get a key with my right hand, but it worked with my left, but then I dropped the torch I was holding in my left hand, etc).  \n\n-   lack of sound effects and ambient sound (I think someone who really knows sound and music in story-telling/games is needed here).  Music stops and starts at weird moments. Also, choice of music is not that good. When the music stops, no ambient sound, no sound effects, you think there's something wrong with your sound.\n\n-  game content :  demon comes running to you, you kill it.  Then pick up a key for a closed door. You go through the door and again demon attaclk (in the same way).  Again a key.  No challenge, no requirement to think, currently no story either.\n\n\nIt looked very beautiful though...  if I would own a game studio, I would hire the dev for his talent regarding graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'm not refunding and I hope future updates will improve it.

Game looks nice. Main issue was the \nlocomotion method. Very odd whereby a pointless animation of your avatar is played walking to where you point, then you teleport there.
