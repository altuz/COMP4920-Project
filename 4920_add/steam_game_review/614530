The only thing Garden Tale has going for it is the artwork, though some suspect character designs (Meryl) manage to tarnish even that. \n\nGarden Tale prides itself on a trap system revolving around Bonions, exploding vegetables that can harm both enemies and allies. The videos and images show large-scale chain reactions that seem exciting and fun, similar to games like Disgaea or La Pucelle. The videos, however, lie about these possibilities in a shameful way, including fabricating combos for show on maps that, in practice, aren't possible to pull off. Indeed, one segment of the advert video shows a combo on one of the first few maps you play on, with a starting point that would require a long-ranged attack. The problem? There aren't any long-ranged attacks, particularly not at that point in the very beginning of the game.\n\nAnd there lies the biggest issue with the trap system; there is no safe way to work within it. Bonions require an attack to detonate them and they explode over a large area, and several hours into the game and 5 characters acquired, I still only have melee attacks. Essentially, bulding a series of explosions thus means sacrificing a character to the fallout afterwards. \n\nExcept, that assumes the traps are worth building in the first place! Enemies are many per map, and they hit very hard, an issue exacerbated by the forced progression from map-to-map without opportunity to grind and level one's characters up. Bonions, further, cannot be pushed, pulled or thrown, they can only be moved with certain attacks done by certain weapons wielded by certain characters. This means, in order to set up traps, you have to spread out your characters, take several turns moving Bonions into range of each other, and then sacrifice a character to detonate them.\n\nIn practice, this will get you killed long before them just from enemy attacks, enemies which have your characters beat both in movement and attack range. The solution? Ignore the Bonions, and just attack the enemies. Not only is this easier, it's the only real effective strategy. Unfortunately, it's also the most boring one.\n\nIn the most aggregious lack of enemy diversity I've seen in any game in a long time, there are only two types of enemies, and fittingly two types of enemy sprites; a melee wolffoxthing, and a ranged wolffoxthing. Further, while there are a variety of skills, they mostly function on the Bonions which have since been established as effectively the most falsely advertised form of a gimmick a game developer can get. So, enemies are uninteresting, and skills - given that they function on a nonfuctioning system - end up uninteresting as well. In the end, the game comes down to hacking and slashing enemies in a very uninteresting, monotonous way alongside some of the worst, uneditable control and camera systems in modern gaming.\n\nThere is little else to save the game from it's badly thought-out battle system. Animations have no flair, music is forgettable, and the storyline and character development are on par with Creative Writing 101 alums at best. There's no way to grind, defeating the fun for people that enjoy that, no real way to strategize, defeating the excitement of one coming from better-made TRPGS, no multiple paths, no exploration, no choice, no point. \n\nEven at under $10, I wish I could get my money back. There are far better experiences even in this price range for RPG fans.

Animation looked a bit stilted, but overall not too bad.  The music is inoffensive, at least.\n\nThen I started playing and realized it was a phone game port.  The mouse was merely an analog to tapping.\n\nThe camera controls are sticky, and the menus large and intrusive.  If I play a game with a neat aesthetic I want to be able to see it.  \n\nI got into the combat and it only got worse.  The Bonions were either overpowered or useless.  Overpowered when they were set up from the start to be taken advantage of.  Useless when it required baiting enemies into their range.\n\nWhat finally broke me was the first boss fight.  I had given up on the Bonions and fallen to normal SRPG stragegy of just sending the heavy guy up front to wail while my others did whatever support they could.\n\nThen the boss summoned reinforcements not only right on top of my crew, but these new troops also got an extra turn.\n\nIf I want XCOM-grade bullshit like that, I'll play XCOM.  \n\nGot my refund after wiping on the fourth map to a scenario I could not have known about and did not have any chance to react to.", "recommendationid": "35006703", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503658", "timestamp_created": 1505594295, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 208, "playtime_forever": 84, "last_played": 1505461975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197965901308"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505298466, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just played the first two maps of this game, and I can totally say that's pretty fun ^_^\n\nThe chance to have chain reaction explosion by hitting Bonions, with the risk of potentially wiping all your characters, (that's what happened to me during the first map :P) adds a nice layer of strategy; carefully positioning them before hitting for the big blast :D\n\nGamewise, it is the typical Advance Wars / Super Robot Wars style game, on its side it really has a really nice character design; the characters so far have pretty nice sprites.\n\nIf you like the genre, it is a game that's worth buying (10/10 would wipe my party again with a big chain reaction explosion :D )", "recommendationid": "34916845", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498197", "timestamp_created": 1505298466, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 537, "playtime_forever": 37, "last_played": 1505319153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048337383"}, "votes_up": 7}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
