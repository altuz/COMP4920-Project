Of course, you can\u2019t expect complex characters and a deep plot, but it\u2019s enjoyable if you\u2019re looking for something not serious.\n\nBattleship Bishojo had potential. But how can I put this\u2026 Nothing much, if not at all, happened in this first game. The girls are bounty hunters and their target are monster girls. Your choices pretty much only give you a few different CGs, they don\u2019t affect the ending. And here\u2019s the main problem in my opinion: [spoiler]they don\u2019t successfully capture ANY of the monsters to sell. They encountered various monsters, and they simply failed to capture them because they a) let them escape or b) the crew felt bad about them and decided to release their targets. I think they should change their jobs because they suck at capturing monsters. lol[/spoiler]\n\nThe ending was rushed and disappointing too. They built up the story\u2019s climax and suddenly BOOM, \u201cthe end\u201d. That was\u2026 Yeah.\n\n3/10. Also, it\u2019s really expensive for such a story where nothing happens. The plot isn\u2019t terrible, and I think this visual novel had potential. But unfortunately, it turned out meh in the end.", "recommendationid": "31862380", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577713", "timestamp_created": 1495292387, "author": {"num_reviews": 385, "num_games_owned": 791, "playtime_forever": 296, "last_played": 1491264266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120348301"}, "votes_up": 39}, {"timestamp_updated": 1491706607, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 11, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "No sir, didnt care for it, especially not for that price", "recommendationid": "31031056", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471175", "timestamp_created": 1491706607, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_forever": 214, "last_played": 1491706554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198118095881"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
