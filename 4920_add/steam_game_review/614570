I planned to lure him into an alleyway by chucking bottles at his head, then Displace behind him and cut his throat. The bottles didn't phase him, then I got frustrated, messed up the displace, and teleported inside him -- at which point he burst like an overripe tomato and painted the walls with gore. If you can't get behind exploding a mime from the inside-out, don't even talk to me. \n\nBillie is brutal as hell. I love it.\n\nOkay serious review though: \n\nNB, I have a pretty solid gaming computer, and I'm playing on medium settings. I have experienced 0 technical issues thus far. I understand a lot of the negative reviews are from people who are having issues running the game -- PLEASE check the required specs before buying because this does seem like a serious problem.\n\nPros:\n* Billie has a much smaller pool of powers, which leads to a much more deliberate and stealth-heavy gameplay style. As Corvo you could always fight your way out and it was super fun, but playing as Billie is TENSE in a way I haven't encountered in a long time.\n* Big maps, lots to explore.\n* GREAT dialogue/writing. Fuck the haters: easily the best writing I've seen in a Bethesda game, pretty good writing fullstop. There's even occasionally these little poetic flourishes that I would love to see more of. \n* Genuinely challenging in a way more games need to be. Play smart or you're gonna die. \n* Despite the short length, there's a really satisfying progression/customization system with the bone-charms. Instead of runes, there's just increasingly powerful and interesting bone charms (much more than in previous DH games) that add a lot of variety to the play. \n\nCons\n* Short. Probably 4-6 hours if you're burning through the plot, 6-8 at normal speed, maaaaybe 12 if you're a completionist.  \n* Doesn't seem as replayable as DH1 or DH2 -- the limited powerset means you're probably only gonna play the campaign through once or twice. High Chaos/Low Chaos, done. \n* Lots of reused assets (even whole maps like the Conservatory) from DH2.\n* Have encountered a few scripting bugs that really shouldn't have made the live game, mostly relating to moving between zones -- there's contracts that require you to knock somebody out then dump their body in x, but then you can't get the body to x because it requires a new map to load and your kidnap-ee disappears. \n\nPro OR Con depending on what you want out of it:\n* Graphics identical to DH2. Don't expect it to look any prettier, but don't expect to need a new graphics card either. \n* This is NOT an action game (see below)\n* A lot less forgiving than other DH games. Billie has 0 ability to tank, even by the standards of an assassin, and screwing up WILL get you killed. Her movement skill is slower and doesn't go as far, her face-steal barely lasts long enough to make it useful -- you have to plan methodically to have any hope. It's much more of a traditional stealth game in the vein of Thief than a stealth-action hybrid like the other two.\n\nHell, let me elaborate on those last two points (and the first Pro). I am an old-ass man, and I remember Stealth games of the 90s. If you got caught by a single random guard, you had decent odds of making it out alive (if you got it over quickly). Two guards? RUN. Billie plays like that -- she hits hard and fast, but one solid hit will take her down. Billie MUST stealth, and her abilities play into that very heavily: she gets no combat boosts outside of equipment upgrades, she knocks herself over if she teleports into somebody, and she has Foresight, which is probably the best stealth/recon tool I've ever encountered in a game. Even with the twin-blade and some of the beefier late-game bone charms she's still a total glass cannon. Billie is not meant for front-on assaults at all: she's meant for\n\n1) avoiding combat all-together and\n2) meticulously planned surgical strikes\n\nShe's so fragile, you start avoiding even unecessary assassinations, in case somebody is watching. When violence does happen, it's fast, tense, bloody, frightening. If there's two guards standing together, you better learn to wait until one of them leaves before you go for the throat. It kinda reminds me of the recent Atomic Blonde: the fights play out like close-combat between a (highly trained) woman and a (decently-trained) man would play out IRL -- to win, the woman has to tilt the scales, and fight fast, dirty and brutal.\n\nThere's a real tension and desperation to the way Billie handles that I haven't seen in literally decades. You will spend five full minutes lurking on a drainpipe so you can drop down and kill one measly guy without being noticed. You'll hear that musical sting that means you've been rumbled and just immediately bug out because there's no way you're winning a fair fight. You'll run, find somewhere new to strike from, spend another ten minutes planning while swearing under your breath.\n\nIf that sounds boring to you, this isn't your game. If you miss the days of Thief: the Dark Project, this is right up your (heh) alley.\n\nEDIT: this has been rewritten quite a lot, as I've now completed the game.

It's 5 missions long, and I beat the game on the hardest difficulty in about 5 hours. The only reason this did not release as a dlc, is so they could charge more for it.

But a terrible Dishonored game. Wait until it goes on sale.\n\n+ The game is well optimised and runs fantastically on PC\n\n+ The visuals are gorgeous as always\n\n+ The contracts system adds a lot of fun new challenges.\n\n- There aren't enough consequences for your actions. The removal of the chaos system reduces replayability, and all endings lead to the same overall outcome.\n\n- No Clean Hands achievement means that non-lethal players are not rewarded for their playstyle\n\n- There are far too many enemies in lots of the levels, making it a pain to get around.\n\n- One level is used twice, and another level is a slightly tweaked level from Dishonoured 2. So as a result, in a 5 mission game, we only have 3 genuinely new levels. That's the same amount as in the Brigmore Witches, for double the price. That said, the new levels were all fantastically atmospheric, particularly the final one.\n\n- OG+ mode is awful, and only allowd you to use three powers from the previous games - Blink, Domino, and Dark Vision.\n\n- The characters are all pretty badly written. Daud is especially dire, and doesn't act in any way resembling his real character.\n\n- Billie's powers are awkward and limiting, making it far less enjoyable to play than previous games\n\n- There is no way to upgrade or buy powers, so this is the first Dishonoured game with no progression system whatsoever\n\n- Sometimes you finish a level only to learn that a character has died, even though you never killed anyone.\n\n- Only 5 missions. Honestly, I was expecting more for my money.\n\nOverall, it's still good fun if you like Dishonoured. I got 20+ hours out of it. But if I had to rank both Dishonoured games, the Dishonoured DLCs, and Death of the Outsider, I would consider this to be the worst.", "recommendationid": "35024963", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579343", "timestamp_created": 1505658888, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 1477, "last_played": 1505657746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033541859"}, "votes_up": 124}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505882294, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 52, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I really wanted to like this but overall it's not worth full price. Its definitely not a bad game but I can't give it a thumbs up. The gameplay is just as good as it is in Dishonored 1 and 2 but this one has some other big issues. To start with there's only 5 missions and the last one seems like they're padding by placing a bunch of enemies on the map and trying to make the game longer. My second issue is the writing, it's pretty bad and the story is not great. This one is also far more linear and only having 3 powers doesn't help that. I was also looking forward to original game + but was disapointed when I found out you only get 3 powers and don't get to choose. The powers you get from Dishonored 2 are also pretty similar to the ones Billie already had. On a positive side the performance is pretty good and there's alot of options to tweak including a FOV slider. If you've never played Dishonored 1 or 2 pick those up instead. I would only get this if you love Dishonored and have played the first 2. This is definitely the weakest in the series so far.

I've bought every game and bit of DLC released. Even the books and such. I have almost 160 hours logged in D1 and over 90 in D2, so it pains me to say that DOTO did not hit the spot for me. I paid $50 for a six hour game for starters. This just wasn't long or deep enough to warrant a full separate release. It should have been $20 DLC. \n\nSpoilers may follow:\n\n- The ending of D1 left me awed at the journey the game had taken me on. The end of D2 left me satisfied that things had been set right. The end of DOTO made me feel like I'd been trapped in a corner by a philosophy major who'd had too many coffees and wouldn't STFU. I was caught between apathy and annoyance. \n\n- Way too many fucking cultists. Apparently stuffing levels with enemies was prioritized over actual challenging gameplay. There's no Jindosh beauty in this game. Not even close. \n \n- Unlike other iterations of Dishonored, this one almost felt linear. There was still some range of choice, but not compared to previous titles. In some levels, previous levels were used, but even they were cut down!\n\n- Unlike in previous games where the drama played out directly in the actual gameplay via animated cut-scene in DOTO it's mostly you do some generic Dishonored blinking around to a designated point on the map, complete the level, and then a non-animated cutscene takes the place of what really should have been the most dramatic moments of the game. \n\n-Sorry, but Billie Lurk was not written well enough to be the protagonist. I found her voice acting flat and unemotive, and I'm not sure I would have cared anyway had it been better. Even Daud came off as flat and apathetic. The game spent the whole time trying really hard to be meaningful and deep but in the end it just felt disconnected, disjointed and sort of unsatisfying. There was no moment of triumph. No swelling of music, no joy to be found. There was just moralizing and whimpering and a story that lost its way. It didn't even have the balls to go full on \"Evil Emily\" ending. It was just \"oh well, I'm a murderer woe is me.\" (Apparently the non-lethal ending is more cheerful. Even so, the other comments stand. It's still a short, shallow shade of the first two games. Would have been fine as DLC, but not as standalone.)\n\nTo sum up, this fails on level design seriously, story line out of what feels like laziness. The gameplay is sort of interesting and might have held up better if the levels had been more expansive and not the tiny space same over and over.", "recommendationid": "34991608", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592969", "timestamp_created": 1505552445, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 178, "playtime_forever": 370, "last_played": 1505551170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011527648"}, "votes_up": 140}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505801174, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 41, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "As a huge fan of all earlier installments of this series, I was extremely hyped to see a new addition to the storyline as a so-called \"Standalone DLC\". Sadly, it did not meet my expectations at a 300NOK (38USD) price-tag. For just a couple more dollars, you get all of Dishonored 2, which offers a whole lot more content. I feel the game's pricing relative to content is a big issue to me, as the game gives off more of a DLC than Standalone vibe. The \"Standalone DLC\" naming has gotten a far higher bar of expectation than regular DLC, and this should not have been advertised as anything more than just \"DLC\". I played through the game in a day (8hr sitting, approximately) sneaking through every mission, trying to find all interesting parts of each map. I have to say that I was fairly disappointed with the amount of things to do.\n\n-Upon entering the game as Billie Lurk you're probably hoping to get some of her backstory and connections to Daud clarified throughout the story. That's not happening. All we get of character from Billie is a fairly flat voiceover through cutscenes telling us things that are either explained through the world through missions or that has been told to us in earlier games. \n-There are 5 Missions in the game, 2 being pretty much the same one and 1 being on a reworked map from Dishonored 2 [spoiler] The Conservatory [/spoiler]. \n-The storyline feels sort of forced, as this hatred towards the Outsider comes off as unmotivated from a player standpoint. In earlier games, the Outsider has been a guide of sorts. An omnipotent character who pops up out of nowhere and builds the world or explains motivations. This is the Outsider that I enjoy. However, in this game, all he really does is sit back and watch as you're on your way to deliver his demise. Sure, he does come up here and there to talk to you, but the impact is far from the same as it's been before. Daud's hatred towards the Outsider comes off as an old man rambling on his deathbed, trying to put the blame of his mistakes on anyone but himself. Billie simply follows along with the wishes of her former mentor.\n-The Powers in this game are interesting, but few. You gain 4 Void Powers in total and these are all you gain through the game. What were passive Abilities in Dishonored 2 can mostly be found as Bonecharms (Like Agility). Should you pass through the story and enter the Original Game +, you will no longer have these powers or Bonecharms, but you will gain Blink, Dark Vision, and Domino instead. You don't gain access to the full arsenal of Powers from Dishonored 2 or even the one you had in your original playthrough (which is to be expected of any \"New Game +\"-like system). \n\nI'd recommend playing on a fairly strong computer, but this requires no more performance than Dishonored 2 did. I encountered some spots where frames dropped, but these were high up and overlooking the edges of the map. \n\nTL;DR: Buy the other earlier games and DLC instead, or wait until this comes on sale.", "recommendationid": "35041445", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579688", "timestamp_created": 1505724208, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 304, "playtime_forever": 513, "last_played": 1505666675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001678567"}, "votes_up": 103}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505546606, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 81, "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 5, "review": "Ok so I pre-ordered this game because I love the series but I gotta be truthful to what I'm about to say.\nI feel the pricetag is alot for something that feels empty at the end of the game.\nI finished the game and walked away with \"hm ok\".\n\nNow I wish the recommend this game part said \"Yes + No\" or a custom type of recommendation so let me explain why.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who are fans of the series but I do not recommend this to anyone who would end up picking up and playing it.\n\nLets start with,\nPros:\nGameplay is great and feels the same as dishonored 1 and 2 in terms of doing different types of tactics etc,\nGraphics are good but sometimes performance suffers even on my beefy PC,\nThe voice acting is top-notch,\nThe sections of the game are very lively,\nNo bloodflies to scare the crap out of you,\nThe new powers are brilliant.\n\nCons:\nThis should've just been some cheap DLC like brigmoire witches rather than a whole different \"game\" even though it uses the dishonored 2 engine and the same exact locations which are just revisted,\nThe story is way too short and doesn't really reward you with any \"OMG\" moments,\nThe missions seem lazy compared to dishonored 1 and 2,\nYou have 0 incentive to not murder everyone in sight as it doesn't affect the game ending,\nYou play as one character (while i thought you play as billie and daud kinda like corvo/emily),\nIt took me 3 hours (Though i did afk hour alot due to not caring if it was on or not) to complete it while collecting and completing any side quests/contracts on max difficulty,\nYou can easily run through this game if you don't care about killing,\nThe performance of the game in terms of FPS mirror dishonored 2 launch issues with fps drops,\nOnly 5 missions and one shouldn't really be considered a mission as its that short,\nOnly 1 new type of enemy aka the void version of the clockwork soldiers,\nYou don't get to upgrade your powers only more bones,\nYou only get 3 powers through the whole game until you get a certain weapon that is just MEH.\n\n\nSo all in all I'd tell you to wait for the game to be $10 as I feel I just wasted my money.\nThe only good thing about the game is it at gave me some time wasting for FIFA around the corner.\nSo my final review score is -\n\n6/10 - Above average aka mildly mediocre.", "recommendationid": "34989960", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585861", "timestamp_created": 1505546606, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 680, "last_played": 1505545840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961325502"}, "votes_up": 170}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505875608, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 67, "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 4, "review": "First of all, this game should be a 10 dollar DLC, not a 30 dollar standalone.\nSecondly, this game kinda sucks.  The most fun part of Dishonored was how there were multiple, creative ways for you to get through an area.  However, in this game, you only get 3 powers, and their functions only reinforce the linearity of the levels.  The powers are a sort of blink where you can leave behind a marker and teleport to it later (the only thing that can be used creatively in combat) a sort of dark vision, and a camflauge.  None can be upgraded.  The ability to speak to rats is ultimately useless as they tell you nothing you couldn't simply find out by looking around.  There really isn't anything interesting for you to do in each level, which would sometimes lead me to just run straight for the objective and get it over with.  I haven't even bothered playing original game plus, I heard it only gives you 3 powers from the original game which are very similar to Billie's default powers, not helping at all. \nAnother problem;  The game is 5 missions long.  Way too short for the price they placed on it.  Also probably plays a role in how crappy the story is since there wasn't enough game time for it to develop.\nLet's talk about the story.  Sucks.  Rescuing Daud felt incredibly anti climactic and all of his character was thrown out the window.  He's only here this game to tell you to kill The Outsider.  Pretty disappointing, I really liked Daud in the first game.  And the whole \"kill The Outsider\" thing seems interesting at first but it isn't.  There isn't really any build up to it or feeling of \"oo I can't wait to kill him and see what happens.\"  The ending is also very anti-climactic, and this whole story itself seems unnecessary.  All this does is make The Outsider even less of a mysterious, omniscient being, which are his interesting traits.  \nIf you really want to play it, wait for it to go on sale for at least 50%.

It's too short and the story has some issues. If you're a fan of the series, wait until it goes on sale. If you're just an action RPG fan, find another game.\n\nLonger version:\n\nIf you take a long time to explore each level and really pull it to pieces, searching for every secret, you will squeeze about six hours of gameplay out of this game. The game has only five missions, of which one is fairly constrained and small, almost like a tutorial level, two take place in the same area of Karnacka (a new region aclled Upper Cyria District) meaning you spend about 60% of your time in the game there, one takes place in a rehashed map from Dishonred II, and the final mission takes place in an area that, although extremely large, is fairly linear. For a game that cost \u00a320, I expected more than this - a couple of extra levels wouldn't be remiss.\n\nThe new powerset, while thematically interesting, introduces very little that we haven't seen in the series before. There's Displace, your mobility power, which acts like a limited-range Mark/Recall from Morrowind and can telefrag. There's Semblance, which acts like Corvo's Possess except you wear their face instead of their entire body. Foresight is equivalent to Dark Vision, except it can predict an enemy's footsteps, and while it's arguably the most innovative power, it's also the one I found the least use for. Void Strike is basically exactly like Windblast. It's also worth noting that you don't get any of your powers until the second mission, which, while consistent with the original two games, means you spend an appreciable chunk of the game powerless.\n\nAs for gadgets, the Hook Mine is basically a more hilarious stun mine. The Hyperbaric Grenade is interesting and useful but there's so goddamn few of them in the world that the only place you're likely to find them is at a black market shop. The Voltaic Gun combines the functions of both the pistol and the crossbow, replaces tranquiliser darts with shock darts, lets you shoot a really hard pearl at people for some reason and also features a chargeup function which I literally never found the need to use.\n\nThe story is weirdly paced and questionably written. Elements are brought into the game without very much explanation, and the way in which Billie Lurk gets her replacement arm and eye happens so abruptly and inexplicably I initially thought it must've been a glitch. The game's story - as with all Dishonored games, come to think of it - has a huge number of extremely interesting ideas and concepts that it has no idea what to do with, and which it has difficulty articulating. The story sure does a lot of telling, rather than showing, and there is an earthshatteringly significant revelation towards the end of the game that it is entirely possible for you to straight-up MISS if you skip past conversations or don't read the right books.\n\nThis game needed more love.

The music, (Rest in peace, Daniel Licht.) the level design, the enviroment, the gameplay, all live up to Dishonored standards. Though graphic and gameplay wise the game is virtually identical to Dishonored 2, it is still praise-worthy. Because of that, the only thing that really needs reviewing is the new additions:\n\n- The constantly regenerating mana instead of having to chug a limited supply of elixirs during a situation all the time is a refreshing change and to me is something that all the Dishonored games should've had to begin with.\n\n- So are the contracts: Which basically exist as tricky but devoid-of-needless-exposition side-missions that offer coin only upon completion of the main mission, thus adding an element of uncertainty wether you get to spend that coin or not in the next level, which urged me to be more tactical about my purchasing. I approve of that actually.\n\n\n\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and loved the atmosphere of it, I believe it could've hit those notes a little better if the whole deal of the game wasn't spoiled by the title alone. It feels very much like a taunt to the face of all Dishonored fans.\n\n\"You know that black-eyed whimpy-voiced demi-god that may or may not piss you off? Yeah you get to kill him.\"\n- It's kinda translating to me as if that should be the only reason to buy it.\n\nBut sadly the part that the developers have failed to emphasize enough: is that it is an expansion of Dishonored 2. Despite being sold as a seperate game and charging you roughly the same retail price as the full Dishonored 2 experience, it is not a new title. It's just a copy-paste of Dishonored 2's areas, enemies, mechanics, graphics etc. But with 3 new abilities (Yes just 3, and you don't even get to use them alongside the abilities from earlier games.), and 5 quasi-linear missions.\n\nPersonally I do not believe it is made clear enough. So I will state it here: [b]If you are new to the Dishonored series, don't buy this untill you've played most of the previous installments, because as a standalone expansion it adds very little new and has rather little content, it is at best a follow-up for the avid followers of the series and should only be treated as a DLC to Dishonored 2, enjoyed purely for story reasons.[/b]\n\nTherefore I do not recommend this untill there is a drastic price drop.", "recommendationid": "35094580", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555011", "timestamp_created": 1505954282, "author": {"num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 999, "last_played": 1505949276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "steamid": "76561198056591778"}, "votes_up": 51}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505439738, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 27, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "First impressions - well written, great voice acting, fantastic mission design, very good atmosphere - with a few changes here and there (which I don't really want to spoil, but there are a few interesting twists compared to Dishonored 1&2, as you may guess from the title of the game), it's mostly the same old Dishonored we've come to know and love.

I dont believe it is worth the price being asked. I absolutely loved the previous 2 dishonored games, and this dlc just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Story wise, if they were so keen on writing out the outsider they should have just done it in the third game and actually done the character some justice. \n\n(STORY) You spend the entire game chasing a nonsensical grudge that Daud has. That, in summary, is that he is mad the outsider gave them powers because he used them for shitty things. The fact that he let the power get to his head is somehow the outsiders fault, and so the outsider needs to die, rather than own up to his own actions. Hes also only a part of the game for about 20mins and then again at the very end, so if you are looking for a satisfying end to Daud's story, youll basically never get it. And really, you wont get a satisfying end to any story here. They drop the fact that the outsider used to be mortal as if it was some big reveal, even though anyone who played D2 already knows this. I suppose it makes sense since Billy Lurk wouldnt know, so its a big deal to her, but from a players point of view that is a waste of time. I wont get into the the end of the dlc too much, only that it felt like they needed to write out the outsider somehow and this was the most profitable way to do it. The ending cutscene, explaining the loss of this omnipotent being that has been a huge part of the last 2 games, was about 30 seconds long and didnt really say much of anything. If youre here because you think the outsider is an awesome character and you want more of that story, youre not really going to get anything that isnt horribly cliche, or that you already knew.\n\n(GAMEPLAY) Generally you would want to add and build upon the existing formula for a dlc, expansion, or sequel. Death of the Outsider does none of the above. There are no ways to upgrate the abilities you have, which wouldnt be an issue if they didnt all feel like neutered versions of the abilities you had in previous games. They are actually all around worse in any situation that isnt meant to be recorded and put in a youtube montage. Want to see through walls where your opponents are like previous games? Ok cool, now its a disembodied spirit you can guide around. Only problem is, A) you cant move with this on. B) you can only mark about 4 people before you can no longer see anyone. If you mark more than that, people will begin to unmark. C) it drains extremely quickly so you have to be fast, it pauses time, and limited range. You can no longer teleport at will without a bone charm, now it requires you to select where you want to go, THEN press the button again to teleport. Which could be a cool idea, ignoring how limiting it is in terms of mobility and escape, if you didnt need to be within range and be able to see the marker to teleport there. So instead of being able to set up plays with recall points, its just a shittier version of your basic teleportation. Every mechanic in this game just makes me think of the saying \"If it isnt broke, dont fix it\". I fully respect they wanted to add new twists for billy lurk, but they really should have given her actually NEW abilities instead of bad versions of old abilities that worked great previously. \n\nReally, this isnt anything special, is extremely frustrating at points if you were a fan of 1&2 or loved the story, and definitely is not worth the current price tag. I still recommend getting it on sale, maybe finishing it in a weekend before the next game comes out so youre cought up on whats canon, but dont be expecting anything other than a mediocre, phoned in experience", "recommendationid": "35001784", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526105", "timestamp_created": 1505580497, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 371, "playtime_forever": 439, "last_played": 1505578306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043721247"}, "votes_up": 76}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505961019, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 14, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe level design of Death of the Outsider continues this series' high-quality tradition as a great example of modern Immersive Sims yet lacking the climax level like \"The Clockwork Mansion\" and \"A Crack in the Slab \" in Dishonored 2. Nonetheless, \"Upper Cyria District\" is still a great work and probably the largest level in this series. \nThere are only three skills in this game, but it's fun as always, can't blame it too much.\n\n[h1]Scenery[/h1]\nThough the art style between Dishonored and Dishonored 2 is different, especially in the Void. In Dishonored, the Void is an azure foggy space with floating small islands on which some historical events reappear in a freezing form whereas in the sequel the Void is a dark and malevolent place with platforms constituted by sharp black pieces of stone. I prefer the former much more for its mystery and elusiveness, that is the real essence of Dishonored's world.\nThe scene of Ritual Hold is very impressive: there are a few huge stone pillars in this empty dimension, whales roaming in the dusty sky, the sunlight is dying; wading through the shallow oil-like water, you can feel a primal fear. It's so fabulous and spectacular, and it fits the Void very well - This place is the end of all things. And the beginning.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nI can't accept the fact that the Outsider falls so easily. He should be an apathetic but curious god, granting power to those who interest him and wondering their choices. He is not evil nor just, he doesn't care human's rise and fall, he just wants to roll the dice and wait for any outcome. If there is any darkness to blame for, then it's in people's heart, not the Void.\nThat's why Dishonored attracts me, it does not focus on becoming stronger and killing every enemy in front of you, it's about choice and outcome. And there is always such uncaring god watching you and making comments upon what you have done. You are the one who pulls the trigger, and the Outsider just magnifies the result so we can see it more clearly.\nBut there is no Chaos System in this game so the choice doesn't matter except for the last time, and the Outsider lacks the motivation to help Billie kill himself, at least the game never explains. What's more, when Billie is doing and has done her work, the reaction of the Outsider is too weak, too mortal (though he is a mortal now, he still has insights when he was the Outsider), it ruins this character and the mystery alongside him. That made me feel disappointed.\n\nThis is definitely the end of the story beginning with the death of the Empress Jessamine Kaldwin, hope it will not be the end of Dishonored series.", "recommendationid": "35086555", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536870", "timestamp_created": 1505921745, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 1022, "last_played": 1505908660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198112404440"}, "votes_up": 41}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505621160, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 39, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "imagine god giving u powers to do anything...you use those powers to kill ppl... and now u wanna get revenge on god... is it ur fault or gods? for 30 the price is too high and dauds motives make no sense..glad i got my refund, wait till it drops ( im  guessing christmas sale)", "recommendationid": "35013564", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511645", "timestamp_created": 1505620987, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 102, "playtime_forever": 72, "last_played": 1505532579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034829585"}, "votes_up": 75}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505631753, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 31, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Not a very engaging experience, with a story that further ruins the point of the Outsider.", "recommendationid": "35016243", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495410", "timestamp_created": 1505631753, "author": {"num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 154, "playtime_forever": 101, "last_played": 1505554080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079141886"}, "votes_up": 62}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506483937, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Is Dishonored: Death of the Outsider a good game?

You can spend 5 hours on a single mission alone, finding all the different nooks and crannies to try and find the tools you need to do the job quietly.\nBut if you don't care about any of that and you go around sword fighting everyone and not really trying to avoid detection, then the game can be over real quick, even if you're not trying to speedrun it.\nThere's only 5 missions.

I mean it's an awesome concept, \"Kill the Outsider, kill a God\" but there's no final boss fight against him or anything so don't get excited. It feels a bit weak in some parts - Billie, the main character, is so quick to hop aboard the \"Lets kill a god\" train. She needs literally 0 convincing to agree to help Daud end the Outsider.

I won't say poor execution because it still held my interests, just some parts made me thing \"Um...     okay\"\nIf you ever wanted to get the game, I'd say it's enjoyable - but wait for it to go on sale to get your money's worth.\nIf I were rating this on a scale of 1 - 5, I'd give Dishonored Death of the Outside a REAL strong 3/5.
