Well. I can see why they are upset about it. But the game is realy fun to play!\n\nPro's\n-Fun and adictive gameplay\n-Fun strory. Its generic. But fun.\n-Lots of things to collect. God I love collecting things! I MUST COLLECT\n-Fun and cheap. The Phone version is free. But some game Machanics are diffrent on mobile devices.\n-Fun art style\n-The background in the game chances depending on where your driving whit your train. This makes the game alternately qual sight.\n-Easter eggs. Lots of Easter eggs. ( Not gonna spoil anything )\n-Large variation in railcars.\n\nCon's\n-Game progression slows down a lot after around a hour or so.\n-Making Money is a pain sometimes.\n-The Distances you sometimes need to make are to long. Causing long waiting times. This is a aspect from the phone version of the game. It should be tweaked is my opinion.\n-You cannot sort train cars out when looking trough your rolling stock. Making it difficult to look for certain train sets.\n-Is repetitive after a while.\n-The economy is kinda Is not well optimized. as you progress things cost so much that its more waiting then playing.\n\n\n\nMy tips for Tiny Titan Studios\n-Add more tings to do when the train is driving long distances. So the player won't get bored that fast.\n-Add a way to sort trains on their speciality. Like Passenger, Food or cargo car.\n-Shorther waiting times when driving to diffrent stations.\n-More ways to make money.\n-Chance the economy and prices of things. It needs to be tweaked.\n-Is There a Tiny Titan Studios train in the game yet? Add that too. A littlle nod to Tiny Titans Studio!\n\nOh one thing that I would love to see ingame.  it would be cool if you could let more trains run at the same time. because then you have something to actually mannage. I have all thse carts that I cannot use because my train cars that I can't use.\nbeing able to hop between trains via the map would be cool. And it would make the gameplay more intersting.\n\nTIny Titans Studio created a game that has a good base for further devolpment. I can't wait see see what things they bring to this game in the future.", "recommendationid": "35157124", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513192", "timestamp_created": 1506181990, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 1035, "last_played": 1507207137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1035, "steamid": "76561198038316589"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505576374, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If there was an option to give a neutral review, I would. There will be more cons than pros in the review, some a bit nitpicky, as I'm hoping the devs will listen to some of them, but overall I still like this game, it is better than the mobile version at least.\n\n+ Nice pixel art graphics\n+ Good diversity of engines and train cars, including some rather out-there creations\n+ No microtransactions\n+ Stable, hadn't have a crash yet.\n+ Very playable at its current state, though there are a few bugs and glitches.\n+ All upgrades and gumball rolls are instantaneous.\n\n- There is not much to do while traveling between stations, especially when they are more than 300 km apart. Having more than one train would improve this issue while requiring next to no rebalancing, as you would still be limited by the amount of cars you have, and high level gumball cars are expensive. Plus, you're supposed to be a train company and what train company would have only one train?\n\n- The scenery frequently does not match reality, it shows mountains where lowlands are, like the Baltic, while not showing mountainous terrain in the Alps. Sometimes it also shows stations that should be in cities outside of cities, so don't be surprised to find Indianapolis in a swamp.\n\n- Maps of certain regions (North America and Europe especially) consist of a loop connecting the cities with few if any other connections between them, which means you have to take some ridiculuous detours while traveling, like from Southampton to London via Galway and Edinburgh, or London to Paris via Amsterdam and Zurich, or Atlanta to Montgomery via Miami, or Milan to Rome via either Lisbon and Barcelona or Athens and Valetta. Russia, Mexico and East Asia (Japan and Koreas) have fewer of these network gaps.\n\n- Many cool engines require 100% region completion to obtain which takes a lot of time and money.\n\n- Many cities are not there. While I'm certainly not expecting all big cities to be there, some are rather big omissions, like Venice, Lyon, Manchester, San Diego, Veracruz, Munich, Gdynia, Linz, Thessaloniki, Varna, or Cologne. At its current state, Europe is pretty empty, which certainly does not reflect reality, as it should be full of cities close to each other.\n\n- As yet there haven't been many updates, but I will give the devs the benefit of the doubt for now, as they are working on adding the missing regions, which takes time.\n\n- Engines do not level up, which means that their patterns/colors stop matching that of their respective cars once you level those cars up.\n\n- All engines sound the same, no diesel produces any smoke, electric engines do not show any effect either.", "recommendationid": "34991576", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505315", "timestamp_created": 1505552349, "author": {"num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 7347, "last_played": 1507205994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2692, "steamid": "76561198056471030"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504592183, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have played the android version of this almost a year ago.

Going from station to station takes a long time and you just repeatedly click the same food cart not to lose money during the first hour.
