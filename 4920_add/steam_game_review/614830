The spray and the way the paint lays down on the wall is the most realsitic I've seen so far. The environments aren't the most intricate, but it is still in early access. The realistic spraying provides enough immersion to make up for the environment design.", "recommendationid": "33524537", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501099", "timestamp_created": 1499989927, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 1903, "last_played": 1506744451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 346, "steamid": "76561198100072013"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501051615, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "In development, this will probably be better than KingSpray when it is completed!\n\n( This app has more artistic features, while KS has more attention to detailed virtual city scenery. )\n\nMost obviously - 2 handed spray!  + eraser and mask\n\nIt's a good price.
