There is one boss that is hard, but can be beat normally. Then you have a choice of:\nA: Boss fight with a mob that dodges your attacks and literally blacks out the interface so that you have to just click randomly around while your party dies.\nB. Boss that only takes one point of damage. After about 10 minutes you get him down to 80% health and then he heals to full.\n\nMaybe with a cheat guide there is some trick to these fights, but there is no feedback that will allow you to learn over time. So even if such guide was available (currently is not), do you want to follow the cheat guide to play?\n\nAlso, after party got wiped out completely the game crashed so I don't know how it treats death. In a split second it looked like it gave me 10 gold for dying. I need 1000 more gold to buy the cheapest new party member (not that this would help versus either boss) so maybe if I died 100 times I could buy one and have some modest progress?\n\nIf you have that much free time, let me know how it turns out for you :)", "recommendationid": "31239764", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535280", "timestamp_created": 1492617322, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_forever": 62, "last_played": 1492616865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197986336400"}, "votes_up": 16}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492998531, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Does not offer much. It's turn based combat with no animations, sprites, or sound effects. You're just looking at some character portraits, selecting abilities, and watching health bars decrease unsatisfyingly. \n\nImagine the type of combat choose your own adventure books had minus the choose your own adventure part. It's just mindless beating on each other (and not in the fun way). \n\nI love turn based games but this is no good, it's just not fun.
