I was expecting a great puzzle game.\n\nThis game probably has one of the ugliest, clunkiest UIs I've seen over a long time. Everything gets on top of everything, you can scroll to infinity, not to mention a few minor details. The editor didn't even work for me.\n\nBut I could have overlooked that and recommended this game if the puzzles were actually nice. Some of the first levels seem promising, but then you start seeing puzzles that are unnecessarily complicated and not elegant at all. As a friend perfectly put, \"you see a huge puzzle, click a few things randomly and accidentally solve it.\"\n\nOf course, you can analyze before testing, but then it's ultimately just a \"lv 10 follow-the-line puzzle\".\n\nAt the end of the day, it's not fun.", "recommendationid": "31387858", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550713", "timestamp_created": 1493270352, "author": {"num_reviews": 143, "num_games_owned": 5647, "playtime_forever": 47, "last_played": 1493269610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198137376448"}, "votes_up": 22}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498614072, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Nice boolean logic game with a few time based puzzles.", "recommendationid": "32903699", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512987", "timestamp_created": 1498614072, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 505, "playtime_forever": 206, "last_played": 1499914281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962439237"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494201154, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I tried. I really tried. I'm not a dumb person, but Cuit is simply too demanding for my brain power. Made it past level 35 with \"relative\" ease, but then it just gets exceedingly more difficult.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's really challenging\n- It has a soothing sound track to salve your frayed nerves\n- It's simplistic yet very deep\n- It uses electricity as a puzzle element\n- All levels are available from the start\n- Level editor\n\nCons:\n- It's really challenging\n- The sound track will get on your nerves sooner or later, believe me\n- The UI is, frankly, terrible\n- It uses elictricity as a puzzle element, but not consequently, which leaves you scratching your head at times\n- It gets so convoluted in the later levels that it's brain numbing\n\nThe game starts off relatively simple and introduces new elements gradually up until more or less the middle of the game I think? (judging by the end boss, there is 1 new element I hadn't encountered up to level 35). It generally follows the principle of powering and de-powering certain switches and stations. That works relatively well. My only complaint here is that it's hard to accept that some elements keep the current flowing, even if they are NOT powered (that mostly means certain switches...I don't really understand that. If no power is flowing to the switch, how can it itself be powered?). And then there is the concept of \"negative power\", which means an element with 2 inputs can be powered by cutting off power from both of these inputs. It takes...some getting used to.\n\nYour goal is to basically power the targets and, if applicable, don't detonate the bombs in each level. I really like the core concept. What I don't like are levels that just play havoc with your brain, i.e. multi-stage levels in which you have to do things in a certain order and if you make a mistake somewhere down the road you have to basically start again (though there is a save level feature which I'm still trying to figure out...maybe this is only for the editor...most likely). It is hard to describe what I mean, but later levels have you alter the path of the current so many times that it's not possible to merely think of the solution from the initial picture, but every step requires you to re-assess the whole level. It's like 4D chess. You can't just say \"when I do this, that happens\", but rather \"when I do this, that happens, which then means I have to do this in order for this to happen, so that this switch changes to that setting, so I don't set off this bomb and power that goal, and then I have to think about how to power the other goal without setting off both bombs and not accidentally disabling the other goal\" Uuuuuuuuuugh. Yes, this is for people with a lot of grey matter ;) That's fine. And I won't hold that against it. Just realize that this is not an easy puzzler. At least I'm smarter than my gf. I think she gave up around level 15-20. It takes time and patience and you need to be able to imagine how the level changes in your head...and then you need to be able to remember several level states.\n\nMy only other complaint is that the UI is shite. Please add a mouseover feature that actually works. The way it's currently implemented is that you hover over an element and in theory the description of that element should be displayed in the bottom. That doesn't work half of the time. Either it displays the level name, the soundtrack, advertisement or \"you are awesome\". So whenever that happens you have to wait for that message to disappear before the tooltip is displayed.\n\nOh and apparently some levels are/were broken, so keep an eye out on the community hub. Though I don't think a lot of people are playing it and submitting potential bugs.\n\nAll in all for a 1 man project and for that price it's a good deal.

The graphics are spartan, but clean and the soundtrack is ultra-relaxing. As far as I've played, the learning curve hasn't been too steep, but still remained satisfyingly challenging (there's some braincells, long dormant from uni physics classes, that were starting to work up a bit of a sweat). It's gratifying to be presented with a spaghetti mess of a new level, complete with new and interesting dilemnas, only to slowly but surely tease apart how everything fits together until you have the right combination and/or order of switches to finish the circuit safely.\n\nThe UI could be a little clearer (the tooltip when you hover over switches doesn't always show immediately and was missed at first), and a more obvious restart button on the screen somewhere would have been welcome (though I discovered pressing 'R' works just as well). There are, however, separate volume sliders...a HUGE common sense addition that some other, much bigger, games fail to include (and bugs the hell out of me), so massive props for that. I can't say anything about the level editor, as that's not my thing (I have a hard enough time solving puzzles, let alone coming up with new ones).\n\nUltimately, I really like it. It's not a massively flashy game, but it's a 'my sort of puzzle' game, I adore the soundtrack and think it's  well worth the price of admission.\n\n(Full disclosure: I know the dev a little, but had no contact with this game until after release, when I bought it with my own pennies).", "recommendationid": "31513432", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1493759234, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 1020, "playtime_forever": 44, "last_played": 1493759096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982199969"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493260564, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is fantastic.
