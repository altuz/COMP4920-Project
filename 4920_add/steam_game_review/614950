Right now you have access to the whole first island which represents 12 levels. This game is a clever puzzle platformer with a retro 8 bits aestethic that reminded me of course Super Mario, but also somewhat Metal Gear Solid and Rick Dangerous. Each level is quite short, but if you want to get the Jars (there is one on each level), you will have to find how, and this is pretty rewarding.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Great clever level design\n[*]Awesome music tracks, with a B-movie feel\n[*]Nice pixel art and funny sprites, also 8-bits rag-dolls and good physics\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Con:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The game mechanics were not very manifest the first time I played despite the tutorial\n[/list]\nI don't see any other Con to list, apart maybe the price of 1$, because this game totally worth 4x the price.", "recommendationid": "33900909", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514996", "timestamp_created": 1501407909, "author": {"num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 1267, "playtime_forever": 398, "last_played": 1501406464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198078288325"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502307634, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Alot of fun for super cheap, as well as the achievements are challenging and fair.
