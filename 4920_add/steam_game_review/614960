You start in the dungeon in a random location (the 1st room is always the same) and the goal is to find where the exit is. The dungeon is a 5x5 grid of levels, with each level having 4 entry/exit points. You need to work your way through the dungeon, checking each exit point until you find the correct one. Each time the game is loaded, the layout of the the dungeon changes with the rooms shuffled and it appears that there are more room variations when you see in a single dungeon, so the game offers a large amount of replayability.\n\nThere is no save system though, so allow at least an hour to attempt a playthrough. There are 2 types of enemy in the game (I have seen), a small version you can kill by jumping on them and a large version you cant. There are also 2 types of traps, spikes that kill you and leave your body behind and a cog that cuts you up into 4 pieces. On top of that each stage is in the dark and the only constant light is from the player, as well as a slight glow from any dead bodies on a stage. You can drop light orbs, but this ability must be recharged via collectables.\n\nI have enjoyed the challenge, and in 4 hours have got to the exit once. While I feel the player would benefit from a save system, I can understand that it would hamper the playstyle the developer is going for. The gameplay will limit people interested in the game, and the lack of a save might reduce that pool of players further - so I would suggest to the developer to add one in (if its there, I haven't found it).\n\nAll that said, I have enjoyed the game and feel its good value for under $2.", "recommendationid": "32153579", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509700", "timestamp_created": 1496499517, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 251, "last_played": 1496495238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960286303"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496943587, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Difficult but interesting game.
