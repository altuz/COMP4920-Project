Room for improvement - more maps, bikes, supersampling for GFX option please. And if posssible for the controllers on vive the posibility to control the bike by leaning the controlers to an angle to turn. more posibilities for controling. more speed - where you can actually hold the right triiger for example for constant increasing in acceleration. (up to a point). it would be nice to have powerups. The music is great!

The controllers positioning should control the turning not the triggers.\n-Add an AI mode or something since the servers are basically dead.\n\nFor now it's just a really basic VR game.
