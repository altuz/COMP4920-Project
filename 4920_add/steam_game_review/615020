However when i first got on i could not find anyone on the severs to play with so i had to play on singleplayer mode. There is a discord for this game but anyway i suggest this game to anyone who is looking for a great strategy game.", "recommendationid": "35381073", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500312", "timestamp_created": 1506863368, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 240, "last_played": 1506465586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "steamid": "76561198220077035"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 11, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
