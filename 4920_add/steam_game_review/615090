You can speed this process up by picking up the collectors and dropping them. This dramatically increases you gold flow. So far i have found out you can only upgrade your castle for a max of 5 tax collectors. So this micro will stay relevant throughout the game, as you will have as far i've seen up to at least 5 towns where gold can be collected. \nSo... [u]if you are in any way a compulsive min/max gamer that cant ignore optimization you will have a bad time with excessive micromanagement in this game.[/u] This ruined it for me personally. (Because of micro you will not be looking at the battles, and excessive clicking can lead to CTS.) But i still like the general design of the game, so if you are the type of gamer that can be more casual you will at least not have a bad time because of this mechanic. \nI only wanted to remark on this specific point.
