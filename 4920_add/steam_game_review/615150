Can't really say exactly  what it is I like, but just enjoy  playing.  It may be too easy, but if you press on you can lose at bosses.  Non boss level enemies just don't have the hit points and damage points to stop you.  For example, in my game file, the characters have about 1000 HP and do -20 damage.  They are confronted by many creatures that do twice my damage, but only have 58 HP.  You might face 3 waves of 3 guys.  I play many turn based games where every click is dripping with tension so this is very refreshing and funny break.\n\n", "recommendationid": "31208105", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1492466853, "author": {"num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 231, "playtime_forever": 434, "last_played": 1492562210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198008322068"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492397165, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I love this game's graphics, sound/music, and simplistic gameplay.
