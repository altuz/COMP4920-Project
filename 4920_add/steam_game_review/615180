It's a very casual game since there's nothing particularly challenging about it while telling a short story using a point/click style of interface. As much as it had going for it, overall it didn't leave much of a lasting impression. I found myself a bit bored due to the excessive walking while repetitively exploring rooms in various floors of a building. It would have been better if there was more story being consistently offered along the way as incentive to explore but it felt too dry at times. At least in terms of the gameplay, I had no issues in terms of glitches/bugs - but I do wish they'd not make the items in your inventory so transparent since it's hard to see what's there.

I spent some of my gameplay time admiring the beauty of this game, it just looks gorgeous. Then there was the puzzles some of them made me feel dumb for a while and made me eager to solve them, they were just executed really well. \n\n Story was somewhat odd(in a good way) I don't think there is a lot of games out there can mix a distopian world with a touching and creepy story. Flashbacks and the \"creepy kids\" kind of elements were used just the right amount maybe a little short since I wanted to see and learn about those kids more and more with every encounter.  \n\nOther reviews mentioned pacing problems. Yes maybe that's the one and only con that I can think of. From time to time game feels a little slow and breaks the immersion for just a second. But it makes a really good job (with a flashback or a creepy encounter) taking you back in to that world.\n\nAs for the conclusion;\n\nFirewood is a well executed Adventure/Puzzle game with its horror elements in its place. Definetly recommended.

The atmosphere is cool and I love the style, but that's about the extent of it.\n\nMy biggest issue, honestly, is the fact that the character is SO SLOW and there is endless walking to be done. I don't mind larger maps, but if you're going to have me searching through a building with multiple stories, and even more rooms.. don't have me dredging along at two miles an hour. It was so frustratingly slow that it bordered on boring, because there was such a gap time between the events that happened and the time it took me to walk there. I understand the guy is an old man, but.. Oof.\n\nI *might* give this a chance later on, since I was so excited to receive the email from Steam that it was finally released, but.. yeah.

It went very fast and the story, while really engaging, felt like it hit the climax and end point really suddenly. I went from knowing nothing to knowing everything. \n\nThe atmosphere is the best part about this game. It is really tense and somber throughout, really inspiring a sense of dread as you play through the game. However, it must be said that the English translation needs some work. Multiple times there were strange spelling and grammar errors that completely killed the mood and made me laugh out loud. \n\nI can certainly recommend it based on what's here, but it's way too short. I honestly thought about refunding it because it went by so fast. And I didn't try to play it quickly either, I read everything and really got into it, but it still went by quickly.

I really have to emphasize the narrative aspect of the game because there is no survivor gameplay.I think Firewood has a decent enough atmosphere, music, artwork and interesting subject for a plot. However, the puzzles ( the core of the gameplay ) were extremely easy, generic, and felt like a filler with no real purpose. If you go into this game expecting to get scared a lot it probably won't happen. This is mostly a psychological experience that aims to deliver a compelling story. \n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nGameplay mostly consists of picking up objects and applying them in correct places. (99% failure proof) I never had to think about how to solve a puzzle in this game. Sometimes you have to look for numbers on walls. Memorize 4 digits is the extent of the difficulty here. \n\nIf this game was completely story based I would not criticize it for having puzzles that have solutions right next to them. If a developer makes all puzzles easy on purpose then what is the point of tedious walking. Firewood could get away being walking simulator but it has gameplay that has little thought behind it. \n\nIt is about 1 hour long and walking around was most of it. Basically, the whole point of \"exploring\" was to throw in some jump scares which had little tension behind them. I think there were some good opportunities to scare a player but they were not utilized. There are a lot of rooms but the game is rather linear. It does a good job of highlighting points of interest so you probably won't get lost with obejctives. \n\nI really wish there was a \"death system\" but I understand why there isn't one. Still, maybe they could have made events where monster gets you and makes you wake up at the earlier checkpoint. When you flash jump scares that have no effect on the character I just kind to raise one of my eyebrows and keep going.\n\nThe psychological aspect of the game was done well. This game jumps between different timelines and I think that is the strongest part of the game. All I am saying that more psychological effects would be better than a lot of crapy puzzles that virtually solve themselves. Maybe it could have benefited from more hidden events ( as far as I know there is one ) \n\n[b] Music/Atmopshere/Artwork [/b]\n\nAt the very least the game has a consistent tone to it. I am not in love with how it was presented but it serviceable.There are no memorable characters or anything that would stand out in my opinion.  I played it during a night hoping to get into the mood and I had a hard time engaging myself. The music was mostly nice though ( except that record song that felt so out of place )\n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts 6/10 [/h1] In short, I don't think this game is great but it ended on a high note. You have to accept the game for what it is which is a story focused narrative. Personally, I really enjoyed the ending but I did not enjoy most of the game up to that point. I can think of couple better games in the same format so take this positive review with a grain of salt.", "recommendationid": "33984937", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499380", "timestamp_created": 1501733621, "author": {"num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 105, "last_played": 1501729853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 9, "total_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
