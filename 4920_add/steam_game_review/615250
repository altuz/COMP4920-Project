Don't buy it.\n\nWhat they are selling you here is the Dos-Box game. The Game, Dos-Box and a front-end like D-Fend Reloaded are all available for free.\nThe Dos-Box that is started from your Steam Library does not allow you to adjust the resolution, so you play the game in 640x480. That's no fun. (D-Fend allows you to do just that. Much better.)\nI still love this game. I had hoped they had done some bugfixing and modernized the GUI so it works well with modern OSs.
