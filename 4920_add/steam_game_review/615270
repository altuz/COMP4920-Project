Its not too hard, although a puzzle has me completely stuck at the moment, but I am engrossed in the simple story, supported by AI players, which is quite cool, and the graphics are extremely good. Excellent use of night and day, and the guns are good and dont need reloading, which I personally like, but a lot of people will complain about I think. Its on the rails effectively, but that still makes for a fun time, shooting everything, and the immesion level is high. Its not the best game, but I think priced correctly, and the English voice acting is quite good, though there are some strange lines of dialogue, which makes you think it has been translated, occasionally poorly. Doesnt distract too much from the overall game.\n\nI really would recommend this as an above average title amongst a sea of average games out there at the moment.\n\nIt will keep me busy until Fallout and Doom I think. Its really Starship Troopers in style of gameplay really, so if you liked the movies and games you should like this.", "recommendationid": "35346965", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529531", "timestamp_created": 1506791493, "author": {"num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 188, "playtime_forever": 229, "last_played": 1506900599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 229, "steamid": "76561197968638558"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506813363, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's a decent game overall. The game is on the rails meaning you just follow where the game takes you. You'll be shooting aliens, bugs and fighting some \"bosses\". The AI isn't interactive per say but they look good and are with you most of the time making it feel like you're with a team. (The captain is a female, and if you grab her boob she does a funny animation. It's like the makers assumed players would do that :D) It's rather short though, but good fun. The beginning pistol they give you made my fingers hurt though since its single tap and the aliens swarm you. If you like wave shooters, this is a solid game.", "recommendationid": "35357256", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506276", "timestamp_created": 1506813363, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_forever": 91, "last_played": 1506810007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "steamid": "76561198122523591"}, "votes_up": 7}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
