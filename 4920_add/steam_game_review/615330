I expected a realistic penguin hitting simulator, but the game is clearly not realistic at all. The physics are all wrong, and penguins don't wear hats.\n\nBut while continuously hitting penguins, it hit me: This game was never meant to be realistic. It was meant to be philosophical!\n\nWhat is all of this about?\nWhere do you want to go?\nDo you want to sacrifice everything for a brief moment of ultimate happiness?\n\nI was deeply touched by this game and it made me ponder the deeper meaning of life.

I thought it would be only batting penguins. But after you bat them you get to guide them in flight via a glider, and when they land on snow via a snowmobile! You get item upgrades that further increases the travel distance of the penguins. \n\nI ran into a few hiccups here and there. I felt like the rings were a little too low. I always found myself flying higher than all of the cool stuff down below. It still exceeded my expectations and is good all around fun.

The game is similar to Angry Birds in the sense that you have to fling a penguin in the air and then navigate it to hit certain bases and rings.
