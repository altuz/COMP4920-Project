I usually don't care about the graphics if the story is good, but with this game it is the other way around, the graphics is amazing, but the story is really average-to-weak in my opinion, you will jump from a conclusion to another, and the ending was kind of meh. The protagonist forgot her objective and got engaged with many other things, which means there will be a second part for this game. \n\nThe Victorian setting is beautiful, each area was beautifully drawn, the music was OK (all the hidden object scenes and puzzles have the same track playing over and over). Characters animation wasn't really good, even the voice acting felt dull. \n\nPros:\n+Beautiful graphics.\n+Fast travel map.\n+Good minigames.\n+Collectibles.\n+Easy achievements (You can get them all in a single playthrough)\n+Steam achievements.\n\nCons:\n-Average story\n-No replay value.\n-Very short game.\n-No journal.\n-Few hidden object scenes.\n\nSince this is a paranormal game with ghosts and spirits, it is still not creepy or scary at all, I think it is safe for anyone with a weak heart. I do recommend this game solely for the graphics, don't expect much of the story.", "recommendationid": "32282646", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580511", "timestamp_created": 1496980884, "author": {"num_reviews": 64, "num_games_owned": 1062, "playtime_forever": 234, "last_played": 1497226848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071375554"}, "votes_up": 40}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497527030, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1]Short version: 75%[/h1]\nScarlett Mysteries is an effortlessly easy hidden object game with a clumsy, but still wonderfully charming little story.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nScarlett Mysteries: Cursed Child is a perfect example of a super casual hidden object game\u2014a game that provides next to no challenge. Its puzzles are a bit rare in HOGs, but they always provide an obvious solution. The items in the hidden object scenes are large and distinguishable. Finally, the point \u2018n\u2019 click parts are held in check by splitting the game into several chapters, all of which have 3-4 screens as the current playing area.\n\nWhile the gameplay is very lightweight, the story, interestingly, is a bit darker than expected. We play as a young medium who is searching for her lost father but stumbles upon a family drama instead, where she has to rescue the daughter of a rich factory owner from a seemingly vengeful spirit.\nWhat is surprising regarding this story is that it should not be enjoyable.

Very nice artwork. About half of my 3.7 hours of play time was actually spent afk. I would say most people should finish it in 1-2 hours. Maybe 3 hours total played if they replay it for achievements. \n\nI have a major issue with the ending of the game story. It does not make sense, and it makes a lot of the rest of the story confusing as well.\n\n[spoiler] Why are ghost Mommy and Daddy acting all happy-ever-after? He tried to steal her family home to bail out his failing factory. When she confronted him, he killed her. And if she's fine with that, why was she trying to kill their daughter? It feels like they just wrote themselves into a corner and ran out of production time so they slapped this ending on.
