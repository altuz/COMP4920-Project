This is what happens when you give someone GameMaker and let them fool around for a little bit.  They make something like this.

I did leave the developer some constructive criticism in my video review, so it's not all just negative stuff and kicking the lone indie developer.\n\nWhile this game shows promise that the developer might someday be able to put together a fun game, this isn't even close.. and it shouldn't be on Steam at any price, period.
