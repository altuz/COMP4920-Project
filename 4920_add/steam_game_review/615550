Combat is Smash Bros style, where damage only serves to increase knockback range, and all KOs are ring-outs. The variety of \"bashers\" (weapons) gives you a lot of options in combat style. Each one is completely viable too, avoiding the \"two or three good archetypes and a bunch of vendor trash\" trap that many randomized games fall into. Staying alive isn't just a matter of not getting hit, it's about not being too close to the edge when you do, especially if your damage is high. Recovery is possible if you get knocked off, but you can't count on it, especially if you're on the lower platforms of a level. Keeping track of where the restore powerups (debuff removal) and heal powerups are in the level is also critical, as you can find yourself needing one in a hurry. Falling isn't a game over, but you lose a random item when you do and if that item is your main basher it can bring your run to a grinding halt. Your inventory is ten slots, which is a good reason to hang onto old items just as a buffer to lower your odds of losing the good stuff if you fall.\n\nThe level randomization works well. Occasionally you get jump platforms or ramps to nowhere, but never inacessible platforms or jumps that are too difficult. Item randomization also stays balanced most of the time, but like all roguelikes/lites sometimes you roll an absurdly overpowered item that boosts you for a few levels, or have to make do with a string of not so good items. That unpredictability is part of the fun though. The learning curve is a bit steep, but since falling isn't a game over learning it isn't a grind, you're just probably not going to finish on your first run.\n\nIt's a simple game, but at four bucks you'll more than get your money's worth. Even if you don't plan on powering through the levels, just bashing on the floating eyeballs is a satisfying form of stress relief.\n\nP.S. I don't have a VR set, so I can't comment on that. But this dev has done VR before and gotten good reviews on it, so I expect it's well executed. Hopefully someone with a Vive can confirm that here soon.\n", "recommendationid": "32516108", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525550", "timestamp_created": 1497729503, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 517, "playtime_forever": 50, "last_played": 1497727647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971763000"}, "votes_up": 19}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
