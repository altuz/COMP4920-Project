There are no fixed points of reference in the distance and the fireflies wafting in one direction can accidentally cause a problem in people especially sensitive to VR sickness. \n\nThe Good: The game is simple, but engaging. If you're a fan of puzzle games, the ability to play with an interactive sliding puzzle in VR is an amazing experience. The game could use more levels, but the levels that are in already are a ton of fun to play and mull over for several hours. I especially like that Solaright takes full advantage of the VR universe to make the puzzle not only three dimensional, but also colorful and interesting. \n\nThe puzzle itself could use some variation in appearance from level to level, and the game could use a little bit of story, but all in all, a ton of fun at a good price.", "recommendationid": "31170113", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512996", "timestamp_created": 1492315082, "author": {"num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 96, "playtime_forever": 21, "last_played": 1506482618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198020135537"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492395394, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've played the work in progress version of this game at NGDC 2016, and they have improved a lot on the environment.\n\nThings I like about Solaright is that it sends the green message of 'connecting the world with Solar power,' and the peaceful musical experience it offers. The sliding mechanics on multiple faces of the cube is unique, and rotating the cube in Vive's virtual environment feels amazing with the overall design of this game. \n\nI just love the puzzle, and it gets challenging over the period. I wish there were a little more variation with the sliding tiles mechanics, but for the price, I think its a good game. And if you love playing puzzle games on any platform, you will just love Solaright!\n", "recommendationid": "31190961", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "timestamp_created": 1492395394, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 75, "last_played": 1492241040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198106247405"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
