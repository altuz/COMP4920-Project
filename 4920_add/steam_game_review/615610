This game follows the same formula of simplicity and replay-ability as its predecessor while also delivering a unique game experience.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly obvious from the demo video, keep your character from entering the black hole while accumulating points for circling it without dying from either entering the hole or being hit by asteroids \u2013 the closer you are to danger the faster you accrue points.  Despite the simple one button gameplay, the game ups the difficulty by adding more frequent and varying dangers that you can only avoid by going over or under. \n\nMy only major complaint with Orbit XL is that this game was easier to play than Bit Blaster XL and took less time to complete.  For a game that relies on escalating difficulty to encourage continued replays it took less than an hour and a half for me to unlock all the skins and achievements \u2013 eliminating any progression (apart from my best score) and thereby limiting replay value.  The game could be improved with some balancing and a few more skin unlocks would be welcomed as well. \n\nOrbit XL is perfectly functional and fun to play and I look forward to future projects by Nickervision Studios.\n\nPros:\n- Simple game design\n- Colors! Animations! \n- Parody Rick and Morty skin\n- But it\u2019s $0.99\n- Achievements\n- Steam Cards\n\nCon: \n- Shorter game life than predecessor Bit Blaster XL\n\nVerdict: \nIf you want to buy a game for $0.99 (barring a game coupon or a Steam sale) and you already have Bit Blaster XL, this game should be next on your Wishlist.\n", "recommendationid": "35166622", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506210802, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 77, "last_played": 1506208882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "steamid": "76561198029040552"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506766657, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very good game when  pubg server is fucking down and you have no games to fucking play", "recommendationid": "35297760", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506695122, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1507113536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "steamid": "76561198283132012"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504955280, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1]You can't pull me inside.[/h1]\n\nVery simple mechanism, and very easy to control.
