As you go through more doors, this dream comes closer to reality. Each room you go into holds a person wanting to change their own life. Not being able to do it, this is where you come in to help guide them. Turning into sheep following you as you go into the next room. Bringing you closer to your own goal, as your clothing, actions, and being followed by sheep is fulfilled.\n\nThis is not exactly a puzzle game, even though it may seem like it. The rooms are easy to figure out and only a few really gets you to scratch your head. I really love how each room had different designs and ways to make the resident talkative. Each being unique from each other as they represent the person and what has made that room hectic to them. \n\nThis is a really short game, coming out as a 15 minute experience for me, so be sure to know that before going in. I know that a lot of people base their choices on game time, so if you are kinda reluctant on spending $2 for a short experience I would wait for a discount.", "recommendationid": "34230801", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514306", "timestamp_created": 1502697273, "author": {"num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 379, "playtime_forever": 46, "last_played": 1501301612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198280371208"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503886772, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "SOLITUNE is a very passive, very brief experience with some colorful, well-done visuals with very little player interaction that ends up being mostly nonsense.\n\nSOLITUNE is a very short (15 minutes total, you see almost every single envrionment you will experience in the game in the 1:00 minute trailer) surreal, relaxing experience with very minimalistic gameplay. You play as a \"shepherd\" entering a series of small rooms which have an NPC in them you're unable to talk to until you click on the right sequence of things throughout the environment, which then unlock a door for you that leads to the next room to do the same process. You do this about 7 times and then the game ends.\n\nYou walk around and click on things and random surreal moments happen, such as trees sprouting from behind you or binders stuck in trees that then shake loose and you click on them when they're on the ground to stack them next to a character, or clicking on some lights until they match the color displayed on a computer monitor in the same room. Aside from the color-matching sequence mentioned (or another where you match 3 icons to be the same on another set of computer monitors) the \"puzzles\" / sequences never have much logic to them beyond just happening to click on objects randomly until you've exhausted all options and the NPC then unlocks and says a few cryptic, wannabe profound lines to you and then you go to the next room to do the same thing. You do this about 7 times then after a brief scene the game just sits there forever (did my game freeze??) with a bunch of sheep lined up below you, crouched down, until you choose to exit the game. \n\nThe incessant bleating from the sheep as you progress from room to room after helping the NPCs (get it??? The sheep are the people you're helping!! *MINDBLOWN*) becomes very loud and grating as you explore the mostly calm environments. This game's art style and colorful visuals are its most appealing aspects. I did enjoy seeing what random, surreal moments would occur in the environments and I didn't expect this game to have complex gameplay, but even when taking those into consideration I feel like SOLITUNE was pretty to look at with not much else going for it.", "recommendationid": "34541172", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513490", "timestamp_created": 1503875767, "author": {"num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 799, "playtime_forever": 16, "last_played": 1503873468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502568941, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A [i]very[/i] short game, but at the same time a [b]very[/b] beautiful and cute game with a philosophical story.\n\n\nFor those that like small and quirky games, I recommend this.\n\nThe vignette art-style is pleasing to look at, and listening to the characters talk is nice to spend 10 minutes and a cup of coffee with.\n\nNot much more to say about this short game.\n\nPlay it if you like small, shot and cute experiences in the form of games", "recommendationid": "34199013", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506658", "timestamp_created": 1502568851, "author": {"num_reviews": 107, "num_games_owned": 2277, "playtime_forever": 165, "last_played": 1502460960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014763908"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503843830, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This review of [b] SOLITUNE [/b] will be a little conservative because if I say anything about 15-minute game you won't have anything left to experience. Well, this game is all about the aesthetic experience that tries to convey a philosophical view on life (which you can guess from the trailer). The delivery of this psychological narrative was decent but it had little time to create a lasting impression. There are few very casual puzzles that did not delay progression for more than 20 seconds. \n\nIf anything I think the game would have benefited from having some secret achievements. During levels, there are some things you can mess around with just for fun. Why not make few achievements for clicking on things that you should not be clicking. Although length through achievements is not the best way of doing things, there are many people who enjoy that ( me included ) \n\nI found the game to be rather pretty but it has some inconsistency with the texture. I would prefer if the game either looked simple or complex all the way across. Instead, it is kind of both. it just seems like certain objects have different texture and do not blend in. Music was pretty fitting for matching the tone though. If it was more than $1 it would be a bit of a stretch but the price is fair. If you like ambient feeling and weird metaphorical imagery you might get a kick out of it.", "recommendationid": "34508246", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498087", "timestamp_created": 1503763168, "author": {"num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1503756093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502297891, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Nah. \nThis is probably one of those games in which one has to know something about philosophy.. or it's just plain stupid.
