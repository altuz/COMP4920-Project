In an effort to make it spoiler free I'll be general about the few I'll highlight.\nNPC who was supposed to disappear with the rest of the baddies just stood there the rest of the game.\nMob in one dungeon never despawned. It just kept being available for an endless encounter farm. \nMaking a menu-box choice didn't do anything. Had to reload save.\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "34541907", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503311", "timestamp_created": 1503879178, "author": {"num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 421, "playtime_forever": 345, "last_played": 1503879250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068920890"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
