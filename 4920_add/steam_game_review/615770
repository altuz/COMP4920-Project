The storyline is great and the ending really is a scary one. (First time I played it I screamed!) I've played this one at least 10 total times outside of steam. When it came available on steam I was so excited. I couldn't wait to play it! Definitely work it if you enjoy mysteries with a more point and click sort of theming. There is a lot of chinese references as well. In fact you could say that is the theming with this particular one of the games.", "recommendationid": "33542695", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511130", "timestamp_created": 1500059665, "author": {"num_reviews": 99, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 152, "last_played": 1500059549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198103347134"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
