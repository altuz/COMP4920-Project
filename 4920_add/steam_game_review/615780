I can't say that without explaining. The only reason I feel that way is because of the point and click mechanics. There is always just a small part of the screen that will allow you to do a action. But other than that I loved this game. I've probably played this one at least four or five times. The theming is around Marie Antionette and its rather interesting. I sort of wonder if the spin that they brought up in her history is actually true of her history. Something to ponder on that is for sure.", "recommendationid": "33547385", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504993", "timestamp_created": 1500075698, "author": {"num_reviews": 99, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_forever": 162, "last_played": 1500075475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198103347134"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
