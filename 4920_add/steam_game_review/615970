Your observations are very useful.\n\nAll the best!", "review": "I want to like Displaced. I really do. But in its current state, I just cannot give it a positive review. I sincerely hope the devs are planning to release updates, because I'd really like to have reason to change these words in the future.\n\nDisplaced is a game with a ton of potential, but sadly, it wastes most of it. Where it had the opportunity to build a gripping, atmospheric narrative where you try to survive the atrocities of war, it falls flat and becomes an unengaging clickfest. You click around the map as you move your survivors. You click through the boxes of text that make up the scenarios (and by the time you finish one playthrough, you will have seen them all multiple times, making the game lose replay value). You click through approximately 200 \"you encountered another group\"-notifications, as the game lets you choose whether you want to attack, greet or hide from them. Most of the time, you'll be fine if you greet them... and then, the strangers decide to move with your group across the map, which promptly forces you to react to the very same \"you encountered another group\"-popup every time they come close to you, something that very well might happen every other second. It's just as annoying as it sounds and at times, it makes moving across the map insufferable.\n\nThe characters in your small party of survivors each gets one line of backstory and one positive or negative trait, but that's about it. They lack personalities and they do not react to the world around them or the choices they (you) make. Decided to stand by and watch an innocent man getting executed? Meh. Shot and killed a teenager? Nope, nothing. One of their own perished while trying to save a victim from a fire? Let's bury them and lose one day's worth of travel, then we'll be a-okay. Nothing that happens, however terrible it may be, is ever mentioned again, and you don't get any sense of accomplishment after finishing the game as you just get a generic \"war takes its toll\" before: Roll credits! Truly a shame since a lot of the different scenarios and choices are interesting and could be and do so much more, but are left behind and forgotten as soon as they have happened.\n\nComing across food, weapons and meds isn't hard; The biggest challenge you'll face is picking what to leave behind when your generous inventory is full of goods. The combat system consists of dragging the character portraits into empty spots, picking weapons and attacks, and then watching the character portraits attack the enemy portraits. Combat doesn't necessarily have to be engaging, but when you play survivors, not soldiers, it really should be. It also shares the same issue as the survival parts: It is way, way too easy. You'll have a good chance of winning every fight from the very beginning, even if your characters are unarmed and the enemy consists of a bunch of armed marauders; 99% of the time, your characters will even escape completely unharmed.\n\nIt took me 2 hours to play through the game twice, escaping to safety both times via different paths. The first run was an... okay experience, it was enough to make me want to experience the game from start to end. I was waiting for it to lift off, to engage me, to make me feel something. Bu both the narrative and the gameplay failed to do that, and realizing the game was over without ever really going anywhere was a huge disappointment.\n\nIn its current state and for its relatively low price, Displace might an alright game to pass an hour with, but nothing more. I feel like the devs are on the right track, though. They definitely have a good idea and a promising premise, but still, execution is everything. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for their future improvement and releases.", "recommendationid": "33817301", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590852", "timestamp_created": 1501101609, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 354, "playtime_forever": 125, "last_played": 1501076532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057818607"}, "votes_up": 54}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501095231, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game is okay at the moment.
