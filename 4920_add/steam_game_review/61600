Zen bound 2 is a a 3d puzzle game wherein the player is given control over a 3d shape attached to a paint covered rope and tasked with covering a certain percentage of the object with paint. It has a nice ambient soundtrack and lots of different objects to fiddle around with. The \"challenge\" of the game mostly revolves (ha) around grappling with the controls as the 3d manipulation with a 2d device can be challenging but as long as you don't get too upset with the occasional tangle this is a nice laid back game to unwind with. If anyone works out VR support for this it will be very cool.\n\nGood\n-very mellow experience\n-Lots of content\n-does what it does well\n\nBad\n-some controller niggles\n-the rope sounds make me feel like I'm on a pirate ship\n\nAll in all this is a uniquely original (well, a bit, it is a sequel after all) and while it might not appeal to everyone I think it is a worthy addition to the library of puzzle fans. 4/5 solid"}]}
