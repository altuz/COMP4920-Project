This game is an Absolute Gem!!! ([u][i]you'll get the joke if you play the game[/i][/u]). It is a [b]Must-Play[/b] for Fans of Rogue-like, Samurai, Sword Play, Minimalist Aesthetics & Gameplay, and Pure Fun!!![/h1]\n\n[b][i][u]TL;DR - BUY IT!!![/u][/i][/b]\n\nFirst off, the price is Spot On. There's no reason to wait for a sale, get this game ASAYCAI [i](as soon as you can afford it).[/i] It is very fun, easy to pick up and difficult to master. The difficulty comes from some design flaws, like the fact that enemies can cheap shot you with a clairvoyance that is utteraly ridiculous, right as you enter a room... or that controls are in fact [i]too[/i] precise. \n\nYou do have to aim at your target before striking, and while it may seem like the controls are a little off - they are in fact incredibly pinpoint, almost to a fault. The angle and timing really matter, even more so given that you only have up to 3 consecutive attacks. If you have good spatial awareness, you'll get used to having to adjust your angle by literally a fraction of a degree. This could mean the difference between executing a sweet combo... or just getting executed.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is the BG Music for the main levels. It's the exact same looped track and it does not really vibe well with the music in the Menu, Shops and \"secret\" Lore Rooms. It's way too fast-paced, and bass drum heavy to be the song that you're hearing throughout most of your playtime. The 16-bit Midi feel is great, but every other song in the game is much better than the main track imo. It wouldn't be so bad if it switched every 3 or so stages after you find the lore room.\n\nWould also be nice if you had the ability to switch the locations of your abilities at will, but maybe in a future update?  Anyway, it's a great game and I Highly Recommend it.
