This is an idle clicker game that actually has a short story that is compelling, which is offered through an AI computer as your progress.  The story is obviously piecemeal, but a world better than any other clicker I have played.  \n\nBut, my game broke after 3 hours of clicking.  When I searched for answers I found (a minority of) others in similar situations.  The player ultimately needs to overcome a hardship, but my game gets stuck.\n\nSo, for me, the game is broken.  It froze in my case.
