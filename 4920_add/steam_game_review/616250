I can also say that this is another job well done. I can't wait for the final version, there r gonna be some minigames!\n\n+ The Voice acting r improved greatly. \n+ The Characters now have some kinda movement like in Nekopara ;)\n+ Finally a Visual Novel with Isekai settings that is not involving any Orcs or Tentacles. Don't know about the future updates tho\n+ Tons of Dialogue Choices. fckn love it!\n+ Visuals r great as always.\n\n- Still an EA game so.. You'd be left hanging for months of Developement.\n- No Immouto this time? Sux\n- I still don't like their choice on music.
