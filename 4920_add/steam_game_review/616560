This is little more than what we used to do in Garry's mod, ten years ago, when we would spawn hundreds of different units and make them fight one another for our amusement and though this game looks about as good as GMOD and is as well animated as GMOD, it brings my PC down to a crawl and has crashed my computer at least once.
