The game definately has pontential but I agree with above post,  it does need some work and the speed feels a little janky in places. The fact that the coaster track in places seems to be suspended in air without any ground pillars adds to the motion sickness a bit. All in all I do believe it is worth the $5 price tag as long as the developers continue support. I do love me a good old VR coaster ride.

There are 4 rollercoasters and I was only able to enjoy the fairground one. The rest are trash. The mine and mountains rollercoaster both sent me falling through the map after not making a jump, something I never wanted to experience in virtual reality. The house rollercoaster gave me motion sickness for the second time in my 5 months of playing a vive. (the first was a motion tracking issue, not the game's fault.) The rollercoasters are also very bad design, there arn't any gliding, fun coasters, just ones where you go so fast you cant even comprehend the turns, which just makes it unbelivable and completely ruins the immersion surronding the VIVE's amazing tehchnology\n\nDo yourself a favor and go buy another game with that $5, like tacoface, tiny wheels or rec room. all of which are great games, cheaper than this load of crap", "recommendationid": "31783891", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "timestamp_created": 1494927085, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 11, "last_played": 1494926588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198104975398"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492595171, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 24, "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 2, "review": "i GAVE THIS A YES CUZ IT HAS GOOD POTENTIAL AND GRAPHICS ARE PRETTY GOOD BUT IT DOES NEED SOME WORK DONE LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE HANDS FEEL WEIRD ONE FEELS HEAVY AND ONE GOES SIDEWAYS AND OTHER IS FLAT..
