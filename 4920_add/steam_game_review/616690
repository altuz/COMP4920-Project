Then this is the game for you! \n\nBeautifully simple gameplay as a vehicle for a story that was not only captivating, but unique. The narrative is complex and at points disturbing, and without spoiling anything, very meta.\n\nThe soundtrack also creates the perfect atmosphere throughout, and coupled with the art style, it provides the perfect ambience. I L\u00d6VE THE C\u00d6L\u00d6RS. \n\nOverall for a solid 2+ hours of content, it is well worth the price. Hell, you couldn't even buy a movie ticket for this cheap!", "recommendationid": "35324312", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511049", "timestamp_created": 1506750385, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 117, "last_played": 1506749456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "steamid": "76561198035695358"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
