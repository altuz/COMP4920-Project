One of those games where you say to yourself just one more go, then find yourself still playing an hour or two later. One change I would like is when you hit a time extension after your time has ran out it should count and let you continue. It's happened to me a few times when I've hit the ball and midflight the time has ran out even though I hit a time extender with that hit.  Just a minor annoyance though... In my first few games I made the mistake of trying to smash the ball hard every pitch - my shoulder is still sore the next day.\nWould dislocate my shoulder again.", "recommendationid": "33852066", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "timestamp_created": 1501235299, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 78, "last_played": 1501852092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087703755"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
