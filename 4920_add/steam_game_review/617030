The good reviews, well edited trailers, and neat concept fooled me. It might be a good game, but at this point it's pretty far off. \n\nAI is hilariousy bad. Graphics are worse. The under water area on the game is indescribebly barren and the trailers make it seem MUCH more than it is. There's obviously bugs... as with any Alpha game, but there are several that made me question just why they thought this build, or any previous build was even close to a release. The \"fight off\" pirates part is a hilarious misrepresentation of what combat is all about. \n\nCombat is as follows: Upbeat string music begins playing, you look around and spot a dingy with a driver and a man firing at you. The boat pulls up to within about 15-20 feet of you (every time) from whatever intial angle of attack they first came in on, with no variation, maneuvering, or semblence of any real AI. They cant shoot through the cabin of the boat, so you just time the shots and peak between firing, because otherwise the gunner WILL hit you as they have laser accuracy at whatever distance they can engage. Both driver and gunner take 3 shots each, if the gunner is killed first the boat immediately does a u-turn and tries to flee,  if you kill the driver the boat sinks, you get some loot. And then another one comes... And another. And another. Annnnd another. Until you destroy a beacon with 50 shots or about 300 swings of an axe. Enemies on platforms stand entirely still, no seeking cover, no running from shots, and no rection to being shot. As stated turrets and pirates can engage from a long distance and will hit you EVERY SINGLE TIME. So in the case of attacking a pirate fort... there's probably 15 people and 5 or so turrets firing at once, making it impossible to even leave your cabin. \n\nI'm sure if the dev is worth his salt and continues to work on it, it could be a pretty cool game. But at the moment it's far too rough. $15 is even too much at this point.", "recommendationid": "35255891", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1506580172, "author": {"num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 56, "last_played": 1506631700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "steamid": "76561198021922204"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506989149, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "dugs dugs so many dugs", "recommendationid": "35431171", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1506989099, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1506882902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "steamid": "76561198196986787"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504748296, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great stuff, updated often.", "recommendationid": "34786328", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494254", "timestamp_created": 1504748296, "author": {"num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 3812, "playtime_forever": 59, "last_played": 1504748097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967918496"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504980321, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "review": "THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE.
