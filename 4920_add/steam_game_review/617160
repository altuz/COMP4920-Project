Not like the other game in the same genre. You never see old cabin made from wood plus dogs howling. \n\nAnd whatever you see in this game it's not a devil like the western horror game. But this is real thai ghost from thai myth. I guess you guys never seen anything like this before. This is why so many people scared this game.\n\nAbout my Experience in this game so far i should said this is good game from Thailand dev. It made from Unreal Engine 4 and they have done with the graphics for me graphics looks amazing.\n\nBut actually this game have something to fix it about stuttering between gameplay. this problem happen because some area in game has been changed in dynamic between you playing. You will see this mechanic in the other game name \"Layer Of Fear\" But i didn't found any stuttering like Home Sweet home\n\nI'm enjoy this game so far. So let me say about verdict of this game.\n\nProps\n+ Story it looks great like you watching Thai horror movie.\n+ Graphics.\n+ Ambient is so great like you get in to Thai haunted house by yourself.\n+ Gameplay you just didn't hide or run but you have to solve the puzzle in sometimes.\n+ Real thai ghost from legend and myth.\n\nCons\n- Still too short. I plant beat time at 6 or 6.30hours But static from the other one said you will beat this game in 4.30 or 5 hours.\n- Stuttering from loading new area between gameplay.\n- Not everyone can enjoy after finished the game for the first time.\n\nFor me this is another great indie horror game like outlast. If you are horror game fans you should have this game in your library. Or if you boring western ghost and find something new... So i invite you too feel some thai ghosts.\n\nMy score:\n8.5/10 [With 9.99USD] \n7.8/10 [With above 9.99USD]\n\nAnd the last thing i came from thailand. I hope this review can help you decide to buy or not.\n\nThank you for reading.", "recommendationid": "35244030", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586823", "timestamp_created": 1506526853, "author": {"num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 1031, "playtime_forever": 76, "last_played": 1506689004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "steamid": "76561198002972223"}, "votes_up": 93}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506501045, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 29, "comment_count": "13", "votes_funny": 5, "review": "awesome game! i played it and competed the game in 4 hours 30 mins. lot of great jump scares, i literally jumped in my chair.\n\nI wish there were move scenes from the cabin area, was very spooky.  i highly recommend this game, it's a top 5 for horror indie games.

When I started writting this review. I haven't played through the game myself but spent hours watching casters on Youtube. Which most of them are western gamers. Because I really want to see their reaction and it turned out pretty positive. However it's quite pre-mature to review the game that I haven't played but I am not here to give you guys a full review of the game. Just try to add somethings to help people understand a bit about this game.\n\nHome Sweet Home is by far the best horror game that came from indie developer in Thailand and I hope to see more of this in the future. The story is great at least to our standard. On par with good Thai horror movies. But the voice acting is a bit odd to me considering hearing both Thai and English which for me turned out to be that the English voice acting is better than Thai. \n\nThis game scared me and that's the reason why I haven't started playing it yet. Yeah yeah I know what you think but I will start it soon though.\n\nNow it's time to talk about things that gamers from other countries may not understand or think that many things in the game don't make sense like why on earth that there're soda bottles with straw on the top of the closet or table. Well, that's a form of worship. As you can see that it usually set right next to a figure. The figure could be anything that people believe. One example is a figure of a tiny figure that represent kid. Some people believe that soul from the kid that dies young could be trapped in these figures and they will protect you, your properties and also give you luck. In return you have to take care of them like you would take care of any kids. I know it sounds weird to some of you.\n\nSo the game is pretty much all about ghosts and urban legends that will give you a glimpse of our culture and believes. Like Preta is quite an amused name that I've never thought it would be called like this in English. But Preta is basically a form of life after death. Once you've done a really terrible things like killing your own parents. Once you die. You will become Preta which is a giant creature as tall as a palm tree and have big hands the size of palm tree leaf. Preta also has a pin hole size mouth so it couldn't eat much or at all.\n\nI am not going spoil you here.\n\nThe developer is doing a pretty good job of putting all the small details that make this game much more intense and legit as a Thai horror. It makes me feel like I'm really in a bad dream that will never ends.\n\nCongratulation! you've just made a great horror game I loved and scared.\n\nI hope this will help many of you understand more about Home Sweet Home. \n\nStay alive and don't play it alone.", "recommendationid": "35359999", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535094", "timestamp_created": 1506821798, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 421, "last_played": 1506959359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 421, "steamid": "76561197970589373"}, "votes_up": 52}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506600034, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Home Sweet Home is a really good Horror game.\nHome sweet home got tension, jumpscares, stressfull hiding and sneaking, puzzles, great visuals, awesome sounds, its cheap and its long.\nThere will always be different opinions on mechanics and gameplay, but Home Sweet Home does it all really well, we will never get a \"perfect\" game anyways, cause we are all different.\nHome Sweet Home is as close to perfect in the horror genre as possible, i really enjoy the game, and its been a while since ive been scared and my adrenaline pumping. 10/10.\nIf you like Horror games, this should be your first pick this year thats for sure.\n\nHeres some gameplay.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eOfqu5aYQA&t=8s\n", "recommendationid": "35260286", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525984", "timestamp_created": 1506600034, "author": {"num_reviews": 341, "num_games_owned": 642, "playtime_forever": 413, "last_played": 1506612077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 413, "steamid": "76561198020085437"}, "votes_up": 19}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507127180, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hmmm...yet another indie horror game based on Asian ghost mythology graces Steam. So how does this one compare to other recent efforts I've played?\n\n   Well, right off the bat, I certainly found it more compelling than White Day...a game which I started sooner, but will clearly be finishing later. (Fear not, a review will eventually surface, just as soon as I find the patience to waste more of my precious life hiding from that pesky janitor.) I'd also say it's much better than Nightfall: Escape, a tad better than Araya, and roughly on a par with The Coma: Cutting Class and the first DreadOut.\n\n   So let's get this straight: I did like it. A lot. But I do have some reservations I'm going to share with you, just so you know what you're getting yourself in for.\n\n   First up: load screens. These were interminably long when the game was first released - around TWO MINUTES long! - but the devs have at least addressed this problem quickly, and we're now down to less than a minute. It's still an annoyingly long wait between deaths - especially when they're often the result of trial-and-error, and the frequency of saves ain't exactly generous - but at least YGGDRAZIL Group are swift on the customer service front. (There were also huge optimisation problems on release which have thankfully been resolved, at least at my end; though others do still seem to be having issues).\n\n   Now onto some more full-on \"design\" flaws. This is definitely one of those games that, while generally fine in the momentum stakes, has more than its fair share of bits where you don't know what it wants you to do next. Now, there's an art to this. Some games - let's use Layers of Fear, given I've just replayed that - quickly train you into certain behaviours, such as looking every which-way including straight up, or reopening the door you just walked through to find the architecture has magically transformed, to ensure you never get bogged down in the \"what the fuck am I supposed to do now?\" stakes for too long. Home Sweet Home could certainly give a few more hints in this department. It's not a biggie, but like I say, is something that can and has been handled better in games before.\n\n   And then there's the mechanics. Mostly fine, even if you can't remap the keys (fuck you, C for crouch!), but there's some needlessly convoluted touches which add nothing but frustration to the experience. Firstly, when you press E to pick up an item it goes into a kind of \"examine\" mode, and you have to press Q to exit said mode. Suffice it to say, this is the kind of shit that can get you killed if you have to grab something quickly before a monster spots you. Then there's a few other small touches, like semi-involved locker-hiding mechanics which the game only \"teaches\" you (and shoddily at that) in the midst of a life-or-death situation. I don't mind dying in a horror game, but not so many times to such thoroughly needless circumstances.\n\n   Now onto the positives. Great atmosphere, solid suspense, effective jump scares, shit-scary assailants, and the occasional quite clever puzzle. Hell, the \"story\" is even pretty bloody good, as horror games go. Daft at times, as you'd expect, but...informed, for the most part, by a legit kind of \"nightmare logic\". I certainly felt compelled to keep playing on to \"see what happens next\", even if the aforementioned load/save system dampened my enthusiasm from time to time.\n\n   Look...I liked it enough to mostly ignore the technical and design shortcomings and push through to the end in a relatively short period (around eight gameplay hours in under a week). Believe me, that actually says a lot in my book: I'm not known for my patience when games are simply not deserving of it, especially these days (I've played way too many shitty horror games to be overly forgiving at this stage). An excellent game on most levels, and quite a challenging one too, if that's what you're in the market for (I'm about 50/50 on that subject these days, but each to their own. I certainly won't recommend it to anyone not looking for a fairly \"hardcore\" gaming experience).\n\n   I do look forward to the sequel, should it be kind enough to come our way. A brief and final word here: this game definitely ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, and while the story resolved well enough for my liking, those easily angered by such open-ended tactics might want to wait and ensure a follow-up does indeed happen. (And no, I don't think it'll just be a free DLC if/when it happens. It'll be another game, with a presumably comparable price).\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.", "recommendationid": "35471433", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519808", "timestamp_created": 1507123961, "author": {"num_reviews": 429, "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 601, "last_played": 1506958273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 601, "steamid": "76561198048974498"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506571176, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Graphics are great and so are the enemy encounters (for the most part).

In order to activate VR mode, make sure to have your headset ready to go, so when you start the game it will recognize it and give you an option to play in VR. That option will be displayed right after you press \"new game\" on your regular monitor.  Press enter or hit \"A\" on your controller and it should begin the VR play.\n2. Apparently devs are working on performance issues for next patch, game is blurry, and if you try to up the resolution, frame rate will start to dip drastically.  I increased mine to 1.2, it runs and looks ok on GTX1080 I7 processor.  Looks a lot better at 1.5 but with bad performance issues.\n3. Make sure to turn off VSYNC if using VR\n4.  If you get a screen in the middle of a game that says adjust your tracking and align a dot inside a circle, restart the game but move to a different spot, maybe 1 or 2 feet from where you were.  If that doesnt work, restart and move again until you find a sweet spot in your room. That worked for me.\n5. Starting with Level 3 (after the house seen), VR mode is no longer supported, hopefully upcoming updates will fix that\n\nBesides that, I think its a great game, I would definitely recommend it for all horror VR junkies out there.
