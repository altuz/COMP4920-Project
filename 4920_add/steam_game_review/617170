On top of that, the game makes use of stolen assets including but not limited to the tent from Fallout New Vegas and the Main Title music for the original Farcry. As a result of this I highly recommend people do not encourage theft of assets by purchasing this game. I am also flagging and will be reporting this to both Bethesda and Ubisoft.", "recommendationid": "33423764", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722977", "timestamp_created": 1499668619, "author": {"num_reviews": 174, "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1499656317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030863487"}, "votes_up": 247}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499494891, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have only played 26 minutes of this game. Also, this game is only 26 minutes long.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybdM9ZI0Klc\n\nThe developer and publisher have a large history of posting trash games to Steam. These are not proper games, they are intended to be given out in mass amounts so the developer can profit off the sale of trading cards.\n\nMission: Escape from Island is a grammatically incorrect FPS that sees your character crash on an island and attempt to find a way out.\n\nYou start out by crash landing in a helicopter in the worst cut-scene known to man and then must find a health pack in order to walk like a regular person again. The health pack by the way is right in front of the helicopter but it's super easy to miss, so I ended up walking and head-bobbing for half a kilometer before reaching another health pack. Upon getting that second health pack the entire game upped the saturation to 15/10 and blinded me.\n\nOn the head-bobbing note, why is that still a thing in video games? The human eye naturally adjusts for head-bobbing and nearly eliminates it entirely. I don't walk around like a damn rooster, video game.\n\nThe remaining objectives in the game involve exploding three objects, in which the object just magically dissappear into the heavens and simply activating a few switches.\n\nThe combat in the game barely works. Enemies don't shoot at you until they are 15 feet away and your character has perfect accuracy, making the one enemy-type in the game completely worthless. Enemies will often not see you or just slowly walk towards you and die with what sounds like a Microsoft Sam scream.\n\nThe last level in the game sees you call a helicopter to pick you up, except the helicopter just falls through the ground during the cutscene but you win anyways. Also the game ends on a \"to be continued\" screen but you can't exit that screen without opening your task manager.\n\nEverything in this game is an asset from somewhere else, including the stuff that the developer seems to have just found on the internet. The mountain texture is likely a rock texture from a russian website, I know this because on parts of the mountains you can literally see the website watermark from the texture image they used.\n\nThis game also uses music from Kliment, a Russian artist and most likely did not get proper permission to use his song, which is on loop throughout the entire game. I have contacted Kliment about this in case he feels the need to deal with it.\n\nThere have also been reports that the game may be using assets from the Fallout series or other titles. At this time I cannot confirm that.\n\nOverall, Mission: Escape from Island is a fake game, plain and simple. Do not purchase this if you want to play an actual video game.\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful, feel free to follow my curation page so you can see all the games I cover. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/iampattyjack#curation", "recommendationid": "33364915", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619425", "timestamp_created": 1499494891, "author": {"num_reviews": 77, "num_games_owned": 504, "playtime_forever": 55, "last_played": 1499625552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032088203"}, "votes_up": 114}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499585137, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Is a simple escape game, no highlights, a few minutes later you will find that you were deceived, rubbish game.", "recommendationid": "33396720", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533254", "timestamp_created": 1499585137, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_forever": 93, "last_played": 1499589320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198403123753"}, "votes_up": 60}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500458721, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This is one of the worst games have ever played...\nCons:\n-Poor english\n-Terrible AI\n-If you miss something you have to back track a lot\n-Extremly short \n-Feels like you and the enemy are midgets\n-Stolen tent from fallout\n-Final cut scene sees the helicopter glitching through the floor\nPros:\n-After buying this game you will be able to get a refund.\n", "recommendationid": "33648337", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498707", "timestamp_created": 1500458721, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 63, "playtime_forever": 25, "last_played": 1500458499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198191730719"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500607661, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's crap, the first five minutes in.  Much like Falcoware's other games, there's no effort whatsoever, and I thought Way of Hero was pushing it. In the first mission, you're given the task to find a first aid kit, and if you're like me, you passed it first time through. It's at the right when you first start, if you didn't know, though even with that knowledge, you won't be able to find it, as the graphics are garbage. The bloom is so bad, that you can't even see the first aid symbol, and the only reason it's done that way is to make the game look \"next-gen\". It doesn't work, as the game looks like a bad 2005 game... released in 2017.
