Thankfully such levels are only a few but they are superiorly annoying and drag the game down as the boss fights are of such kind.\n\nMixed feeling on that one in terms of recommending it. It's mostly good to very good but the bad parts drag it down.\n\nOne thing should've been explained: What \"secrets\" are and how they work because they aren't actually \"secrets\" like hidden things. It's more that such \"?\"-marked levels, if solved correctly, enable the player to finish them while still being transformed, allowing to use the transformed bonus outside the level, in the world. This way access to furthr areas can be unlocked.\n\nRoom for improvement:\n1) The game would be much better if it had a button that, while pressed, would increase game speed by a modificator. The blocks doing that for enemy movement only aren't always there where needed.\n2) Sometimes I'd also like a grid displayed to know when falling like a whole screen of distance whether or not I'll hit the spot I want to hit and whenever I'm already touching the next grid, eventually touching a bomb block when jumping then.\n3) 3 rows of usable quicksaves would also be nice instead of checkpoint-like saves as those can't be re-used, just swapped and most often aren't there when and where needed the most.\n4) An interact button would've been a better choice when there are signs, screens, info blocks and even jars instead of often using that accidently and unintended just by passing by.\n5) I bought this game for it's \"figure it out\" part, not for having a jump'n run game. There are other games more dedicated to this that are actually fun that way. This one is not. It's just a frustration loop with it's bad, action-like levels, where the player is forced to do perfectly x times in a row before being allowed to save and progress or just progress. It's also not okay to force situations that will always 100% kill the player if not having the knowledge of the level and situation in advance.\n6) For boss fights: Stop the game while anyone talks so that there's time to read ! Also let the player use the interact button or some other non-accidently pressed button to scroll through the dialogue or skip it.\n\nHint: There's a gate with a ?-icon in the underground area early on that, if trying to enter asks whether or not it should open the Hoggy1 levels in your browser. Decline. Otherwise hundreds of tabs may flood your browser (don't know why they did it that way instead of a single downloadable file with level selection) and due to the mentioned fullscreen / windowed mode / alt-tab crash issue after some time of playing your game might also crash.", "recommendationid": "31796088", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512744", "timestamp_created": 1494977179, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_forever": 2315, "last_played": 1500645443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198172392767"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494446707, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "very hard , makes you think alot", "recommendationid": "31671776", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501710", "timestamp_created": 1494446707, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 156, "playtime_forever": 259, "last_played": 1500057660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198142364771"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494978567, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Highly intelligent, very fun game from my favorite arcade game developer,", "recommendationid": "31796331", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1494978567, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 187, "last_played": 1504439048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046438034"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
