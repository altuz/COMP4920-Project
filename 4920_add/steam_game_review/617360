I mean I had read about what the app does, but I didn't expect it to be so thorough, and so darn pretty! The music is calm and soothing. Basically I could easily get so lost in messing about creating a station that I'd miss game night. \n\nIf you are a pen and paper fan, this tool will take so much hassle out of your prep allowing you to spendmore time working on your story.

Designed to create space station designs for RPG games, it can also be used for anywhere you need inspiration for a space environment. I've personally used an earlier build to write a short story set on / around a space station.\n\nThere are a lot of options, with the basic layout great for generating a lot of stations for inspiration, standard for if you already know roughly what you want, and advanced for people who want to put in the time to get precisely the kind of station they're after. You can even tell the app what the purpose of the station will be (Engineering, Farm, Navy, and about a dozen others) so it knows what kind of rooms it should be generating for you.\n\nThe additional tilesets (Dark Alien is my personal favourite, but the \"lettered\" rooms are incredibly handy) are a nice touch, and there's also options for what kind of grid you want and even an interactive fog of war that would be amazing for DMs running a campaign.\n\nSo I guess it does basically everything you could want from something that generates space stations for you.", "recommendationid": "34926004", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502911", "timestamp_created": 1505331621, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_forever": 33, "last_played": 1505939947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027149429"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
