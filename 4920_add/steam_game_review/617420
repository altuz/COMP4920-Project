Is that language even Polish? I really struggled to enjoy the game, it was buggy, there were no instructions, controls overlapped and I didn't understand what was happening. I can't believe I paid money for this, honestly. Willing to give it another shot in a few months when all the issues are sorted.\n\nThis is my first ever Steam review because I strongly feel that this game needs a LOT of work, and people shouldn't pay money for it.
