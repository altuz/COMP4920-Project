The basic premise is that the MC (Yumesaki Haruki) and his friend Tsukibane Ai end up in another world that seems to be in a continuous loop (like Groundhog Day, but a lot nicer). They meet a propieter named Yurika and a bouncing bundle of energy named Riko, and they end up at the coffeehouse run by Yurika. Through a series of choices you can end up with one of these three girls.\n\nThe paths are interesting, and the one that seems to be the true path is a bit... sad.\n\nAnyway, it is worth the read.", "recommendationid": "33877385", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503151", "timestamp_created": 1501323320, "author": {"num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "playtime_forever": 289, "last_played": 1501322842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069159152"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501097203, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I play this game and it bested my expectation of what i had exspected it would be.\n\nI play each of the three route.
