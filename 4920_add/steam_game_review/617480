It looks like devs are really trying hard to fix everything what players report and also theirs response time to bug reports or questions is pretty fast. So if every early access game would be like that, the world would be much more nicer place. :-)\n\nWhat I really like:\n- graphics, videos, etc. looks really awesome\n- time slowing in the battles (to me it feels more engaging than classic pause system)\n\nNeutral feelings:\n- At the beginning I was really excited how the battles looks like (you have battleground and you have to killing enemies whose are comming from multiple doors and wanna kill you), however after some time (I'm in half of second level) I feel like it's so repetitive and I would really like to see more battle modes as well (I know there are boss fights, but I mean something really different)\n- I would prefer wider choice of skills (every level a new skill is opened and then you can choice one from two specializations for that skill).. so at least two skills per level would be nice, to let player select in which way should character goes\n- Difficulity definitely needs little more balancing .. I've started on Hard, only the first fight was hard, then I went to the city, upgraded my characters and never had problem again .. In the second level I've changed difficulity on Epic and again, only the first fight was hard and since then only the boss fights are hard.\n\nTo be honest this early access is so good that I don't see any major issue there, so I cannot write down anything what I really don't like. So if you think you could like this game, don't be afraid of early access and definitely buy it, because for 15e it defintielly worth it.", "recommendationid": "34764077", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502688", "timestamp_created": 1504643320, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_forever": 940, "last_played": 1506849831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198040491007"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505490939, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Seems very promising so far, if you're into micromanaging small groups in real time.

The story is massive (the dev clearly cares about this), and there is great attention to the details of the backstory, dialogue between characters, and lore that can be found around the game. \n\n\u2028\u2028For me the battling is the best part. While it is not without its problems (sometimes tricky to pick the correct enemy - units pass through each other), in EA status it is clearly already in good form. It is tense and have genuinely felt my heart race to survive the onslaught.  Took me a few battles to get used to the mechanics\u2026you really do have to make use of slow time, and be tactical, which is satisfying. I understand there are more battle modes to come, so looking forward to that.\n\nGraphics look great, particularly when you have loads of enemies in battle, and I only ran into a frame drop once while running through the first proper level of the tower. (I am running it on Ultra settings though at 3440x1440 on a fairly decent card so not a surprise). I love the use of light and shadows in exploring, and understand this is to improve further. Use of particles is great. Visually it pops very well. \n\nAudio is decent. Sound design is clear enough and helpful in battle, though some things are missing (here\u2019s a noisy waterfall, there\u2019s a silent one) - and I turned all the levels up in the settings. Music is good  to keep you playing, though I wish there was more orchestra, and sometimes it needs to have more punch. Particularly going in or out of battles, so you actually feel impending danger or success! \n\nI think there is a lot of detail to the leveling up of heroes, inventory, skills etc which I was left to discover for myself. The city \u2018menu\u2019 idea is good and clearly shows the dev cares about connecting it all together with the backstory - will be interesting to see where the story goes. It\u2019s promising a lot.\n\nFrom what I understand from the dev, this is going to be a huge game in terms of content, and it is already well on its way.  In over 4 hours playing I only got to end of the tower\u2019s first floor, so still got 3 more to go just in this current EA build! The dev is clearly committed to the game based on the responses here, so looking forward to seeing how much more it grows.", "recommendationid": "35044652", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499647", "timestamp_created": 1505739102, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 271, "last_played": 1505738499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983083878"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504913421, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "battles are amazing i havent played battles like this before \nthe storyline is awesome keeps you coming back for more \nthree thumbs up from me \ngreat game hope you guys keep up the great work", "recommendationid": "34825217", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502688", "timestamp_created": 1504913421, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_forever": 3281, "last_played": 1505777306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049999231"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506285705, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Developer is on the right track with this game and the optimization is pretty good.  Story is intriguing, but other parts of the game need work or even some alteration.  First each battle plays out almost the same and becomes boring fairly quickly.  This is the same for the loot for the most part.  Although, the character skills are interesting enough and do add some flavor to the battles\n\nI think the game needs more tactics to up the challenge level.  Instead, of having the enemies always come out of little portals where the archer and the mage can pick them off quickly, maybe have them closer to switch the batlle up a little bit, or give some enemies the ability to dodge attacks or even reflect them.  Have some enemies teleport in and out of attack range.  The battles just need to be made not so damn predictable.  I think the best way to make loot better is to make it more randomized and more unique  so it changes the way battles play out\n\nI am giving the developer a positive review because this game is so promising and I think the dev needs some positive reinforcement to make it better.  I deleted it from my hard drive but may re-install if I later see an update that makes the battles more interesting.  \n\n", "recommendationid": "35190470", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506285705, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 190, "playtime_forever": 364, "last_played": 1506215509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 77, "steamid": "76561198154355650"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506629488, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The gameplay of this game is reminiscent of classic games of old with a fresh approach to creating the experience of the player.
