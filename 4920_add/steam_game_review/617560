I really like this software but right now I can't recommend it do to these issues.\n\n\nDecent home design software.\nItem Content is currently lacking and Wall Placement can be frustrating and buggy but overall good for the price.\nHave had numerous crashes but because the software must autosave on each placement I am able to restart without any lost data.", "recommendationid": "31639408", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532948", "timestamp_created": 1494303647, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 722, "playtime_forever": 6015, "last_played": 1498183915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993982569"}, "votes_up": 14}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
