It's honestly a great idea and I'm looking forward to seeing more like this.\n\nThis specific iteration, the \"Japanese women\", seems easier than it's counterpart, \"Beautiful Japanese Scenery\". Each game in this new-ish series is extremely relaxing. I often watch a YouTube video or listen to a podcast/music on my second screen while I piece together these puzzles. I'd be lying to you if I said that when I first read the title \"Japanese women\" I was expecting them to be clothed, but I bought the game nevertheless (on sale) and I'm happy about it. There are 10 puzzles in all, with each puzzle split into three identical puzzles based on the number of pieces in each--60, 240, 350. If you take your time with it, you can easily get anywhere from 12-18 hours out of this game. \n\nIn summation, I'd recommend this game to anyone who, like me, is a puzzle junkie. I'm looking forward to seeing what the devs do in the future.", "recommendationid": "31244436", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509690", "timestamp_created": 1492634157, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 402, "playtime_forever": 1122, "last_played": 1492647825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198122248263"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492888720, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ten puzzles in three sizes (60, 240, 350 pieces) and you must solve each puzzle in every size to complete the game.

A nice twist is that the unlocking unlocks both easier and harder puzzles; it's nice to race through a 60 after spending an hour or two on a 350! The game will separate edge pieces for you, so you can get those out of the way quickly.

I continued my quest and met this woman who was playing with her dangling ball she seemed so fascinated with her ball that I had to get to know her, maybe she could teach me a trick or two. We talked a little and I fixed her up again. I had a wonderful time, she thought me a lot about playing with balls I named her Tama.\n\n\nTheres also a lot of freedom in the gameplay, like I can start with the left top corner or do something crazy and start in the middle. Japanese Women - Animated Jigsaws really emphasizes on creating your own path.\nThere are also sidequest where you can go revisit the women you have fixed but this time it gets harder and you need fix them even harder, but its definitely worth it.\n\n\nI have almost spent 10 hours into this game and so far have only completed 2% just shows how big Japanese Women - Animated Jigsaws really is. I can't wait to invest more time into Japanese Women - Animated Jigsaws and meet the other girls. I did a little research online and spoiled myself a bit but it looks like we will be going to an Onsen (Thats japanese for hot springs) not once but TWICE, it's a Japanese game afterall theres bound to be some fan-service. \nA girl taking a huge bite out of a watermelon, she looks like someone who knows how to use her mouth so definitely gonna need to fix her up.\n\nSo in conclusion please buy this game so we can have more Japanese Women - Animated Jigsaws in the future or maybe even Iraqi Women - Animated Jigsaws.\nThank you!", "recommendationid": "31084184", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495790", "timestamp_created": 1491938285, "author": {"num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 394, "playtime_forever": 4728, "last_played": 1492390376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025618778"}, "votes_up": 17}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
