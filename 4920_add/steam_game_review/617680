I never got the \"swarm\" or \"endless\" gamemodes to work, enemies didn't spawn when I thought they would, but the few combats I had were very fun and I can see this being a fun party game. \n\nOne criticism that's unique to me is that I have a poker 3 keyboard, a small 60% that doesn't have arrow keys. To the devs: I would offer an alternate control system where WASD is move around and IJKLUO are the combat controls. Maybe under settings have a \"60%\" or \"Alternative\" control switch.\n\nOverall, in its current state, 6.5/10. If online matchmaking and the gamemodes were fixed, easily 8.5/10+.", "recommendationid": "31141610", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508483", "timestamp_created": 1492197023, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1492272137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059728358"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495734188, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Haha love this game!
