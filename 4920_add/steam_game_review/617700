He smoked it then meowed at me. Now we are bros, he follows me everywhere. I can't get in my grow room because there is a stoner possum in my way. Considering giving him less weed and maybe he'll leave me alone.\n\nSuper shady dude keeps creeping up on my shop to steal my herbs. I can see him slowly sneaking from a block away in broad daylight. I roll my eyes and light a blunt to smoke while I smack him with a broken broomstick. Next time he manages to get in my shop while I'm gardening and steal my weed in front of 6 customers. I give him the stick he's so used to and end up hitting one of my best customers. He gets free premium blunts when he comes in now. The bud burglar is still at large.\n\nI've had a lot of fun with this game for the 10 dollars I paid for it. I love the idea of first-person management games and shop sims. The only other one I had hope for was Shoppe Keep and it was basically abandoned.\n\nThings I love about this game:\n-Watching people slowly get more addicted to your product. My first ever customer bought $45 worth, now he's in twice a day dropping $400 each time. I treat him like gold.\n-Getting almost anyone high at anytime. you can hand out weed like candy to customers, employees, and possums. It would be cool if you could give weed to criminals to chill them out and befriend them.\n-The map is small but the graphics are nicer than you'd expect. The water looks good, the trees move in the wind, there is a day and night cycle and there are a good amount of model designs for characters, many new ones come as you level up. Some are ugly and some are nice looking but so are real people.\n-Free placement of furniture and art, no grids limiting your style. \n-Employees are expensive but they do their jobs quite well and even need to get high every once in a while.\n-You can teleport to your grow room or sales desk quickly with a button\n-The Interface isn't perfect but its simpler than I expected. Clicking actions will open the relevant inventory and if you don't have what you need you can quickly click the shop button and it will take you to that type of item in the store.\n-Later you get to sell merch too, such as bongs. They are easy to restock and you will make about 20% profit on them if the customer likes you.\n-Completing a transaction is fast and easy like it should be. I'm glad I don't have to play a mini-game with the cash register every sale.\n-You can get stoned yourself, and varying levels of stoned. From colorful buzz to hunting for clam shells to attacking poo with butterfly wings.\n-Customer AI is smart enough to rarely get totally stuck, and in that event, a gentle push usually solves it.\n\nSome things that bug me about this game:\n-Seeds and pots get unrealistically expensive, I'm currently spending $470 per seed plus $250 for a pump and pesticide to get 100g of weed. Every 5 grows I need a new $900 pot because it breaks.\n-All weed is the same once harvested, just the yeild changes. Would be nice if you could display different strains in different containers and if the customer got the one they requested they would be happier.\n-The thugs who come to see if you have extra money that you can't fit in your safe seem to be sexually attracted to walls.\n-Growing 28 plants at a time hurts my wrist.\n-Feels a bit like a grind when upgrades such as a simple poster will set you back $5,000. Wallpaper in my shop costed me $15,000. And it gets much worse. I'm only level 30.\n-There is no pause button and I have to pee. Saving then quitting the game works but all the water dissapears from my plants when I reload. Kind of wierd pausing was left out in a game for people who probably need a few smoke breaks. \n\nAll the games about growing and selling weed that I have played in the past were embarrassingly simple and bugged so this game by far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it, especially if you like first-person management.
