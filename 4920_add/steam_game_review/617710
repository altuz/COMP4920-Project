Secondly, the graphics and sounds are awful. The \"Graphics\" are hand drawn graphics that look like they make the same death noise every time. But, let me tell you about my experience with this game:\n Booting game up for first time: I ran this game on best graphics, because my computer is pretty good. But, if you turn the graphics up (also, only 2 graphics options) the hit boxes for the mouse is mostly off screen. So I turn down the graphics and restart the game.\n Booting up game for 2nd time: The first level, was very easy. But then the 2nd level was so hard, it required me to grind the first level for about 15 min. Also, I had all the enemies spawn and stack on top of eachother in the left column on the 3rd level (which was a glitch I fixed by restarting my game. twice) , so it was impossible. \n\nAwful graphics, terrible sound, game devs that are always on vacation, the one button you use (mouse 1) is broken and hitboxes can be off. Dont buy this game. It was just a cash grab by the devs.", "recommendationid": "33463547", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527071", "timestamp_created": 1499801543, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 132, "last_played": 1503961443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160525368"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502638274, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Best 110 minutes of my life", "recommendationid": "34216284", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496117", "timestamp_created": 1502638274, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 105, "last_played": 1500535714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198131143696"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 14, "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
