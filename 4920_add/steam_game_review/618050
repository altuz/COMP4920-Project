RPG without leveling and with real time fights right on the map. In order to progress you have to collect gear and buffs. Be careful with item buffs because they are NOT infinite in uses and you may lose them permanently. You can use them again to temporary disable. For example, you may want to disable items when breaking large rotating crystals since they will explode, harm you and break a few buff items. And you have to break at least some of these to progress. Probably the most important buff is shield since I haven't found where yo restock it and it opens paths blocked with spikes. A couple of secrets, a few easter eggs and multiple endings... well, kinda. You just either do everything right or end up with a wrong one. Don't rush collecting all quantum piece, though, or you won't be able to get 2 achievements for the wrong endings. Save often in different slots and you should be fine. Music is nice, art is pretty, story is bizarre and shown mostly with environment and short in-game animations. In case you desire more kinky stuff install both nude patches (look on community hub). Does it actually worth a full price? Not quite sure, but it ain't bad. With good discount might worth to pick up.", "recommendationid": "35231896", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507674", "timestamp_created": 1506467548, "author": {"num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 6778, "playtime_forever": 625, "last_played": 1506466090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "steamid": "76561198024968498"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
