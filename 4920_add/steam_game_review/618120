You can go to any website with arcade games and play similar (sometimes even better) games for free. I would completly recommend this if you have a coupon, this is on sale, or if you don't care about spending only just a single dollar unlike I do, feel free to buy this game. It'll be a very short few hours, but they will be fun and entertaining.\n\nPros:\n-Simple controls (anyone can play, and you can play on anything)\n-Great level layouts\n-Not to difficult\n-Easy to understand enemies and game mechanics\n-No bs/straight to the point (no boring or overly cliche storyboards or cutscenes, you go headfirst into action)\n-looks nice at least\n-tRAdiNg cARds\n-ez pz achievements\n\nCons:\n-waaaay too short\n-bullets are invisible on top of snow\n-DAMN INVISIBLE WALLS\n-similar to most (free) 2d arcade games\n-no transitions or briefing\n-pause doesnt pause the game\n-generic final boss battle\n\ntl;dr - good game, too short and simple, buy when cheap or if you dont care.
