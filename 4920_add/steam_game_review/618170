So there is a lot of play hours for your buck. It's nothing groundbreaking but I think the game has borrowed successfully cool features. Platforming is a little bit like older games ( that you may or may not like) but is funny in combination with the gravity shifting and portals. Also, the style is cool and fitting, inspired from limbo and co. Music is sometimes funky and dark/ calmer. \n\nI see a lot of potentials and I would like to have a mind cubes 2 at some point, where they refine all the mechanics with even more gravity stuff! \n\nAlso, I have to credit the developer is direct talking with players and funny, something I wish to see more often.", "recommendationid": "33508839", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506062", "timestamp_created": 1499969874, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 135, "last_played": 1499970596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962264501"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499916605, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "\uff41\uff45\uff53\uff54\uff48\uff45\uff54\uff49\uff43\uff53\n\n\uff50\uff55\uff5a\uff5a\uff4c\uff45\uff53\n\n\uff43\uff55\uff54\uff45\u3000\uff42\uff55\uff4e\uff4e\uff59\n\n\uff4c\uff45\uff56\uff45\uff4c\uff53\n\n\uff50\uff4c\uff41\uff54\uff46\uff4f\uff52\uff4d\uff49\uff4e\uff47\n\n\uff41\uff43\uff48\uff49\uff45\uff56\uff45\uff4d\uff45\uff4e\uff54\uff53\n\n\n\uff42\uff55\uff54\u3000\n\n\uff49\u3000\uff4e\uff45\uff45\uff44\u3000\uff4d\uff4f\uff52\uff45\u3000\uff48\uff41\uff43\uff4b\uff49\uff4e\uff47\uff0e\uff0e\uff0e\n\n\uff42\uff55\uff54\u3000\uff49\uff54\uff53\u3000\uff47\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff4f\uff44\n", "recommendationid": "33494391", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489831", "timestamp_created": 1499916605, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_forever": 120, "last_played": 1500136167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198274794277"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502484745, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "nice atmosphere, good puzzles and achievements!", "recommendationid": "34176739", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1502484745, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_forever": 21, "last_played": 1502484689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963278540"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501868239, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A good puzzle platformer, it's a little bit flawed in quality but nevertheless charming in style, character and has a good price value ratio.
