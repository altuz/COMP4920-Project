The levels alternate between the winding, procedurally generated labyrinths of enemies that you have to eat to unlock an elevator, and boss levels, each with their own unique theme and style. Despite the baseline difficulty being tough, the difficulty curve feels really good, and it's incredibly rewarding to get past that one boss that's been wrecking you.\n\nAfter your first handful of runs, once you have a wider selections of abilities to choose from, it becomes incredibly strategic trying to decide what monster / ability combinations you think can get you the farthest. The game also features a really incredible high score table, which organizes based on the main game and the weekly challenge. Trying to slap your name up on the table for all to see is a really great incentive to keep coming back for more.\n\nOn the technical side of things, after about 3 hours, I have yet to encounter a single glitch or bug. Even with a really crappy laptop, the game ran great, and I never had any stuttering or framerate issues, even with massive swarms of soldiers and robots trying to gun me down. You can tell the devs took their QA very seriously, and their passion for the game shows.\n\nFor less that 10$, I feel like I got my money's worth for a solid game with an incredibly addictive experience. For those that love tough, arcade-y goodness, this is definitely the game for you.", "recommendationid": "33841415", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509272", "timestamp_created": 1501189495, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 74, "playtime_forever": 1035, "last_played": 1504708713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042306926"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501054767, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It\u2019s a good game for short intervals.
