I would reccomend waiting on it and keeping it on your wishlist unless you REALLY like the positives I detail here. My overall review is positive just for potential factor.\n\nSpiritlands is at it's core, a city building/simple strategy game like Settlers, where you start as a small tribe and build housing, resource collection buildings, and military buildings, and set out into the unexplored regions of the map. What makes it nice is that it's relatively slow-paced, so people who feel like they need time to think everything out should enjoy the premise, but it's also got the ability to deal with threats in a few different ways (you can pay them off, fight them, defend against them, or just avoid them). \n\nA few more positives that I found despite some other people's criticism: I find the price pretty fair, especially considering the overpriced nature of some people's early access games. Also there's been a lot of complaints about the UI and the lack of intuituiveness, but I found it easy to more or less beat the first map I made without having to go to any help outside the game.\n\nThe resource system is a bit overcomplicated for what it does (in my opinion it has too many resources that have no real unique use yet), but works fine. You can terraform the land and really have a lot of freedom to build however you like. In addition, the creation of \"zones\" centered on your town center means you don't necessarily have to optimize your town's build strategy in order to be defensible: there's a bit of room for aesthetic pleasures, and that's really nice. Unfortunately, the graphics are pretty ugly, but there's not a lot of prettiness to be expected from small developers.\n\nLike most Early Access games, it needs a lot more content to be fun, but there's nothing much more to be said about that.\n\nIt's got a few annoying bugs that force your view to scroll into odd places when enemies attack. In addition, there's a bug where attacking soldiers you send off vacate their barracks and never return to them even after they win the battle (they just seem to become static bonuses to your attack score).\n\nIn general, once you've gotten your resource values high enough, the game ceases to have any meaningful challenge at all in it's current state.\n\nIn order for this game to really shine, it has to have a military/religious challenge in the late game that scales up even as you conquer most of the map, as well as unique and meaningful ways to make your settlements look cool or have a special flavor so the citybuilding aspect doesn't get boring.", "recommendationid": "32862463", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515255", "timestamp_created": 1498582873, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 306, "playtime_forever": 231, "last_played": 1498552018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014916388"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493325915, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Started playing the game yesterday and about 20m into it I realized I had already made a mistake.

I love games where you can build cities up and such and that's what this is.  You have to be patient, logical, and plan ahead; just like with chess.

Despite the \"you have just to click for resources\", in my first five minutes i had to think how to keep my population feed and resources on a plus rate.

Maybe a tooltip on each icon would help. Also i didn't understand when my \"area\" will expand and i guess it's all about my population number.

It's more of a relaxing type of game, no rushing needed. The game has a nice retro style to it, kind of like the first Civ, very crude and pixely (i like it though). It's got no story or direction, other than expanding your lands borders. If you want to though, you could rush through this game in about 2-3 hours easily, but that's not what it's about.\n\nThe game DOES come with a bunch of problems though..\n\nFirst of all, once you reach mid-late game the game just feels sluggish as hell, and the fps drops tremendeously.. Yeah, you heard me right, the fps.. You'd think you can run this simple little game on your casio digital watch from the late 80's, but this game actually drags to a halt once you progress \"too far\". I don't know exactly why, it might be some bad coding in the backend, but it surely can't be the graphics..\n\nThe GUI is somewhat bad at first glance, and some might say simplistic. I do know it's been improved upon though, so it's not all bad. Once you get the hang of it, you know where to find anything.\n\nThe menu.. Oh lord, the menu.. Nothing works like it's supposed to! At first it might seem fine, but once the game reaches a certain point (just about when it starts to lagg) nothing you tick off in the menu stays ticked off.\nYou can turn down the music or sounds, you can turn of the day/night cycling, you can disable weather effects.. Anything you do seems to reset. And it seems to have something to do with zooming in and out. Yeah, zooming in and out resets your menu choices..\n\n\nAll in all though, this is a game for the patient. It's got a place in my library, even with all it's flaws.\nA simplistic city builder, micromanagement, clicker, soothing experience with great potential.\n\nJust fix the damn bug, please :P for now, it's a 5/10", "recommendationid": "33288110", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506624", "timestamp_created": 1499282905, "author": {"num_reviews": 67, "num_games_owned": 380, "playtime_forever": 451, "last_played": 1501717502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961397228"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495118177, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a very fun casual clicker which makes creating your world extremely easy and thus far the dev has been excellent with keeping updates coming and taking input from the community about things that need help and to be changed. this is not a game you buy thinking that it has a massive amount of depth but more than some clickers I've played. \nOne thing I will say is that if you do not enjoy creating your own narrative and story or enjoy world building either literally the world or designing your own city layout then this game is not for you. there is little hand holding and no exact goal that I see and that is a good thing for a casual game like this.
