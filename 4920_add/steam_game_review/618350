I do recommend this game for the current price of $4.99 and only for those who understand what they are getting.  What are you getting for $5?\n\nWell, you get to listen to your local music (along with a few in-game selections) while you look at a small disco VR world that includes 3 female and 3 male model avatars.  Each avatar has their own unique dance.  You can grab a hold of their hands and move both of their hands.  Other than that, there is no interaction with the avatar although it does seem that for whatever reason, the avatar will at times \"look into your eyes,\" which can be odd.  You can dance along, obviously, but you can't even see your hands or body (just the controllers).\n\nThere are also some items you can interact with in the world.  Random balls of light are scattered and when you touch them it will make a cymbal sound and sparks will fly.  There's also a stand controller on one corner of the room where you can make drum sounds or activate a instrument with beams of light (piano, harp, etc.) and you make sounds by touching each colored beam of light.  \n\nI was disappointed by how small the disco floor was.  You have options to have 1 avatar dance with your or all six together.  Each avatar dances exactly the same routine they are preprogrammed to do.  Most of the avatars dance barefooted, which is odd. They don't even up their tempo in dancing for an upbeat song, although you can make them your dance puppet (at least with their hands).  The avatar also leaves at the end of each song (no loops or playlist) and walks through a wall.  Another annoyance I had was with the teleporting (trigger and joystick at same time on Touch); the control was inconsistent.\n\nOne of the fun parts of the game is that you can customize the look of your avatar.  I danced with a [u] pregnant hag troll with big eyes and small pouty lips with beast hands [/u].  It was the scariest VR experience I have ever had.\n\nRating 6/9 would dance to Hells Bells with my monstrous creation again", "recommendationid": "34545095", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500446", "timestamp_created": 1503896026, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 61, "last_played": 1506135849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 12, "total_positive": 12, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
