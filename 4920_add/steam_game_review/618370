Well , I don't know if story is something important in games like this anyway. \n\nFirst thing we can notice is that the game is (was) designed for mobile use. But everything works fine with the mouse. The only thing I don't like with the mouse is the camera movement , this should be better on mobile.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is a classic match-3 game just like may others. But unlike the others, this time clearing the the board won't be enough , you have to make a way through The Spritelings. That's what makes this game interesting and also challenging. The challenge like others match-3 games comes from the obvious limited moves, blocs that need several hit to be broken, ennemies and so on. In order to help you in your quest, you'll have access to some powers. From where I am, I unlocked 2 of them.\n\nLike I said , we're in front of a mobile game but what is really great is that we don't have the downsides of those games. I mean , there's no micro-transaction , you don't have to wait for lives. You can play whenever you want and that is pretty great.\n\nFor now I've done 25 levels and some were already tough or maybe I'm just bad at these kind of games lol. However there's something that can be really annoying : music. I only heard one music so far.\n\nFinally, I'd like to say that this game is a good one, the fact that there's no mobile games \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665t is a good point allowing players to play at their own pace.\n\nPS : Sorry for bad english !", "recommendationid": "32222740", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530034", "timestamp_created": 1496765738, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 802, "playtime_forever": 1807, "last_played": 1498196545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054292816"}, "votes_up": 13}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497528971, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "absolutely amazing! I\u2019m completely hooked! Its a classic match three game with a twist. There are 5 different spells you can gain by matching there specific colours and you can use to help you to complete the different levels and I love this, I love how you have to move the character to release the spritelings and I love how theres a PvE element to it too! I find myself saying \u201cJust one more level\u201d and three hours later I\u2019m still playing the game. Each level has its own challenges but none are super hard to complete where you would want to exit the game and never play again.

So far I am on level 40 which i belive is the 2nd or 3rd area, fun little cutscenes between areas to progress the story. Definitely some difficulty in getting 3 stars per instance which is calculated with score and turns left over.\n\nYour basically trying to get across the board and save the spritelings, two charcters to select from one male, one female. You can also change their outfits for vanity sake. Also some challenges in higher levels to kill imps or find the correct keys to unlock the cages. The game comes nice little option to hear all the music in the game under the bonus content which has avatars to download and wallpapers to play with.\n\n\nThere also appears to be a level selection of  expert levels once you complete the game on normal or easy I believe, I am only at level 40 right now :)\n\nThere are a lot of the same match 3 mechanics you find in all the Mobile match 3 products so no real suprises but the game is graphically beautiful with a Fullscreen option. Also the art is very well done and easy on the eyes. For the 3 or 4 hours I have spent playing so far it definitely is enjoyable and will have you replaying levels over an over to get those 3 stars.\n\nIt has Steam trading cards but not Steam achievements, seems like something that may get added, but there are plenty of in-game achievements to be collected.\n\nDownload the Demo and give it a try, it definitely helped me decide to purchase.\n\nThe price may seem a little high to some but unlike its mobile brothers and sisters this is a complete game with no in game transactions, also its seems like I will easily get 10-15 hours of gameplay depending on how many times i replay levels or when i decide to take on the expert levels.", "recommendationid": "32223097", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510173", "timestamp_created": 1496766852, "author": {"num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 802, "playtime_forever": 786, "last_played": 1499288827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976127725"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497109831, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Rescue quest is a match 3 game similar to a lot of other games. \n\nWhat it does different is that you have different goals and spells. \n\nThe game is well done.

It has a colourful, well-drawn map. It has colourful, well drawn game graphics. The basic game mechanics are there. And it's oddly addictive. But the developers seem to have gone a bit off-message in a few places...\n\nFor example, there are the usual bonus power-ups, but you [i]can't buy more![/i] Like, wtf? Also, they seem to have missed the lives counter and timer off the display for some reason (noobs), although this doesn't seem to have effected play so far. There wasn't the obligatory pay wall at about level 15 either. In fact the whole of the fisrt section is available as a 'demo' which then asks you to buy the 'full' game to continue. For an insane amount, given this is essentially a mobile match-3 game.\n\nIn addition to these schoolboy errors, they also seem to have provided a few (I'm only at level 37 so far) innovative ideas which are actually quite fun. And the whole thing seems well optimized, runs totally fluidly, and so far hasn't crashed. You can even zoom in/out with the mouse wheel.\n\nCome on, developers! What on earth were you thinking?!?!\n\nSeriously though, this game rejects the business model that many (myself included) have despised for years now; the horrid IAPs. By offering a solid demo and charging a fixed amount to unlock the game without limitations, they have given us [i]exactly[/i] what we have been asking for.\n\nSo obviously, a solid recommendation from me, on that grounds alone. If you are a casual gamer, get this game. Even if you're not a massive fan of match-3. You'll have the fuzzy warm feeling of supporting a developer who has decided to ignore the convention which has come so close to killing the casual games market for many.
