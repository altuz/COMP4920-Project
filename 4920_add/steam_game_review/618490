Fighting is very poorly executed - you can't see your opponent, you can't zoom out when you are aiming, you have 3 usable zoom out bonuses per fight but even when you use them you can't shoot, when you start shooting you are zoomed back on your character. Playing vs bots feels frustrating because I CANT HIT A GOD DAMN THING and the wind is constantly changing, and to get the idea of how strong the wind is you have to play this game for like TEN HOURS I don't know, and the best I can do is TEN MINUTES, because bots hit you every single turn and PVP is non-existent because NOBODY plays this game.\n\n+Visuals - the game is a good looking one, sadly bad gameplay realization kills it.\n-Soundwork - in-game sounds are VERY annoying I had to mute the game after like 5 minutes of playing\n\n+Online ranking that will never change because nobody plays multi\n+Steam achievements that you never get because of the dead multiplayer\n+Steam cards - they look nice.\n\nNothing to add - DISAPPOINTED. You can try to buy it if you have an actual friend that wants to play it with you, but why would you play this when you can play worms?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1094449391", "recommendationid": "33890871", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544403", "timestamp_created": 1501364700, "author": {"num_reviews": 320, "num_games_owned": 5466, "playtime_forever": 250, "last_played": 1501363950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198028673669"}, "votes_up": 20}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500115361, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Mr Blaster is a space based artillery game, released on Steam, iOS and Android.\n\nYou can find 10 minutes of gameplay with commentary here:\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEQjwiUcjUI] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEQjwiUcjUI [/url] \n\nIf you have played Worms or Scorched Earth from the MS-DOS days, then you would be familiar with the style of gameplay offered here. This version of artillery game is simplified though, with 2 players on separate platforms throwing items at each other. The steam page does say up to 4 players on PC, but I have not seen an option to select that.\n\nEach shot is made based on power and angle, hits to the other players platform will do damage to their life bar and body or head shots will do more damage. There is a satelite orbiting each platform that acts as a minor barrier, it can take 2 hits before being destoryed but can save the player from taking damage. There is also the wind, that changes direction and strength with each turn, which will alter the trajectory of the thrown object. The wind is the only real thing that needs to be compensated for and I feel its designed this way due it also being a mobile release.\n\nThe AI in single player games varies from game to game. Sometimes it has lazer accuracy regardless of the wind, other times it will consistently miss. There is no campaign mode, just matches against a random player type. As for player types, there is a range of 13 that have a unique look and a unique projectile to throw, two come with the game and you can purchase the others using in game currency of stars. These are cosmetic, and do not effect gameplay. Each time you score a hit, you gain 25 stars, so it shouldn't take too long to be able to purchase a new character provided you can land hits.\n\nThe game itself is simple and an OK time-waster, but I do feel this type of game would get more use on a mobile platform rather than on Steam. I suggest that you consider where you buy it if the game interests you. AI games are quick and have a round limit, so I see it as a game that lends itself more to playing on a phone when you have a few minutes to kill as opposed to loading it up on a PC to play for an extended period.\n\nWhere it would shine on PC is the local VS mode. The games simplicity allows it to be played with a younger child or sibling as you take turns having your shot. I do feel the developer should open up all character for this mode as it would allow a level of variety in games and improve player longevity. I have attempted to find an online multiplayer match without success, which is expected seeing the game was just released.\n\nThe graphics look nice, nothing overly complex as you would expect from a mobile game. The music is also fine, but I found the sound effects annoying - especially the sound for when shots go out of bounds. This was the first thing I turned off, but when you restart the game the sound effects are back on even though the settings show they should be off. Turning them on and then off again removes them. I expect this will be patched soon.\n\nFor less than $2, I am happy to recommend this game, but do take into consideration if you would be more likely to play it on a mobile device or Steam before purchasing.", "recommendationid": "33556434", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506203", "timestamp_created": 1500115361, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 80, "last_played": 1500112933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960286303"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500102122, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "its just bow masters in space\n\n", "recommendationid": "33553078", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489155", "timestamp_created": 1500102122, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 5, "last_played": 1500101938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198153254758"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
