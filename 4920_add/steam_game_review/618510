I got the game for 27 cents.  The game is very easy to pick up.  You have two choices when starting the game, campaign or car mode.  In campaign you have to fight off waves of enemies from all directions; 8 waves in total per stage.  After each wave you can buy different weapons and upgrade your current weapons.  I car defense mode, you have to protect a car from being destroyed.  In this mode you can also buy turrets to place on your car which makes it quite a bit easier.  I beat the game in about 4 hours over a few days.\n\nBottome line: if you need a 4 hour time waster for a dollar and enjoy shooter games you will probably enjoy this game.\n\nFun gameplay, extremely cheap and pretty decent music = 9/10.", "recommendationid": "34896152", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507569", "timestamp_created": 1505198653, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 316, "playtime_forever": 283, "last_played": 1505197950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034155244"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506573558, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Grabbed my attention for about 3 straight hours.", "recommendationid": "35254633", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500185", "timestamp_created": 1506573558, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1898, "playtime_forever": 206, "last_played": 1506573323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 206, "steamid": "76561198055475511"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504740777, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game was WAY better than what I expected and the art style really surprised me! it all looks great and is easy to notice and learn, not needing a tutorial in any way and even not even having one (which is a HUGE plus for me), the music wasn't that catchy to me because maybe I was too occupied focusing on blasting the almost never ending waves of enemies, but really, if you like this type of game, you should really look forward to buying it.
