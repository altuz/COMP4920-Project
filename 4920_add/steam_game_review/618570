The game takes a very large space to play.  Even with an area large enough to be deemed \"Optimal\" by Steam and Oculus (2m x 1.5m I think) I ran into problems.  Ideally you can reach across your entire space without triggering the chaperone.\n\nThe game feels like a weightless jungle gym.  You grab a spot, pull yourself past it, and grab the next spot.  Sometimes you have to throw yourself to the next spot, which takes some practice.\n\nBiggest problem was, at the very start of the game, I was completely stuck because all cubes were too far away to be grabbed.  By dumb luck, I found a key combination of (Right hand trigger) + (Right hand thumbstick press) that moved me to a better place where I could actually get the game started.  The controller hints must be for another system, because the diagram looked nothing like my touch controllers.\n\nIn another spot, I was standing on a block, but to reach down and grab the block I would have to reach through my own IRL floor.  I looked around and was able to find another block to grab and \"push\" myself down, but this felt like a bug.\n\nGenerally the space issue means you have to be careful when trying to reach too far.  Make sure you hear the \"ding\" indicating you've successfully grabbed your next spot before letting go of the last one.  It's hard to tell if me falling is from lack of skill or vr space issues, which can be frustrating.", "recommendationid": "34407998", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1503374616, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 31, "last_played": 1503372679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966761293"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503360855, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 10, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Looks fun couldn't use it because I don't have a vr headset gonna get one soon anyways", "recommendationid": "34337010", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476582", "timestamp_created": 1503091535, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_forever": 7, "last_played": 1502853863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198385366231"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
