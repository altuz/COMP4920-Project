It's a bit annoying because it can be hard to tell apart a FPS and a wave shooter just based on the media alone.\n\nGraphics are quite nice. But you can't really change the render resolution, and so elements have the vaseline smeared feel that is familiar to some Unreal based VR games.\n\nThere's basically survival mode in the game... and you can opt for either local machine leaderboard or global internet based leaderboards. You get a few rule mutators as well - normal rules, no life regain, no power ups, etc.\n\nAt first blush, there's a reasonable variety of enemies that zerg their way towards you. Zombies, zombie shooters, bugs, slugs, spiders, exploding bees... and that's just the first 3 stages. I'm not sure how many stages there are to be honest, but there's at least 3 stages.\n\nYou also get inverse kinematic arms, which is quite nice, although like other IK arms - glitches out sometimes.\n\nYou start with dual pistols... and basically stay with dual pistols - while getting occasional powerup options between waves. These power ups allow you to upgrade to uzis, and probably other weapons for a limited time/number of shots. But there doesn't appear to be an upgrade mechanic that lets you improve the guns or pick new starting guns.\n\nUltimately, this is an adequate stationary wave shooter with above average for indy VR game developers graphics. If you haven't had your fill of that yet, this will be reasonable entertainment for a few hours.", "recommendationid": "31039616", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524654", "timestamp_created": 1491742165, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 419, "playtime_forever": 10, "last_played": 1491722718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968496198"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492200282, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "What can I say about Zombie Buster VR...hm well its cool and its a stand still FPS game. The game takes place on Mars AD 2075 is where you the \"zombie buster\" soldier are suppose to be exploring a science facility where a group of scientists were researching something on Mars. A month goes by the scientits were found killed by mutant zombies. Your job is to eliminate the zombies. However this game does game isn't 100% perfect and I shall explain.\n\nIssues\n1. Reloading- to reload you put you arms to your sides and the fun automatically reloads for you. However sometimes the reloads didn't work and I had to redo the reload animation to reload. An option to ether reload your self or auto-reload.\n\n2. Graphics- the graphics are blury. No idea why, I had the graphics set to the highest setting and was still a bit blury. also I didn't see too much of a change in graphics, maybe 10% difference.\n\n3. Zombies- the zombies looked too much like an alien. When I first saw them I immidently thought aliens instead of zombies which made me think I bought the wrong game. Since game is called zombie buster and seeing the creatures looking more like an alien I was calling the game alien buster.\n\n3. Sound- the sound was more or less okay. I had no base line to compare so I just didn't pay attention to the game.\n\n4. Features- this has to do with the store page mainly (yes it is part of the game). Number 5 feature says \"A game with Improved artificial intelligence (MOB), more realistic than traditional games by responding to player's movements in various ways) well hate to break it but the A.I. was under average. The zombies pretty much were predictable and killing them were easy. \n\n5. Same pistols- I liked the pistols but after the second map I was bored of them. I wanted something different. Using the same weapon for what 6-8 maps gets boring pretty quick.\n\n6. Local and World challenge- I have no idea why this is part of a game that is suppose to be \"immersive\". When a game adds compition to it, you will be trying to get the highest score possible to be in a rank, which will make you remember that its a game.\n\n7. The Hud- the bullet, health and slow-mo were annoying on my face. I would assume I was wearing an advanced helmit but that being right were I need the most vision was a nad placment on the developer's part.\n\nI am not saying the game is bad, but I was getting bored with the same weapons and the challenge part just made the game boring for me very quickly. I would have loved new weapons or moving around the maps and being able to reload my gun myself because that would make me immersive in the game regardless of graphics or sound issues. Zombie Buster VR gets a 6/10 score and I can recommand this game if you are a standing still, FPS, challenge player.", "recommendationid": "31142494", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1492200151, "author": {"num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 80, "last_played": 1492193098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198186133689"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492476258, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This title could be GREAT! To me at least. But It needs more and the correct vocals. Heashot is not near enough and gets annoying for me. The vocal could match the multiplier shooting sequence, 1st vocal for a headshot should be \"Headbuster\" then 2ndX vocal could be \"Skullbuster\" then 3rdX vocal could be \"Brainbuster\" etc..Being the game is named Zombie Buster. Another great change would be to make the left gun red and the right gun blue to match the HUD. We need a cooler gun upgrade menu ingame for choosing. The guns should change visually for that limited time This game is pure arcade and I love it. So I understand the HOTD mentality but my suggestions would only enhance the arcade experience at least for me. Could you add the option to have the gun reload by gripping the grips on the controllers also. Can you make the waves more diverse. Add some vocal story and minor teleporting within the room they just feel empty and mindless for me. I still ove it. LOL. The hud is very cool for arcade VR. I would widen it a bit more, it is a bit to close. Thank you for adding the arms, so great to not just have hands a gun. The game grafix are real nice! I did have to crank up SS in Vive steam settings to 1.8 for clean background. The characters are very well done. I like the alien zombies. I could go on with tons of other tweaks that this game would benefit from.
