Not sure how else to describe it. \n\nThat said the game is extremely fun with a lot of trial and error in each track. You will die a lot but the game doesn't punish you too much. When you fall you instantly restart. When you die you get a game over screen, but just mash the A button and you're back in the game. \n\nGood hand eye coordination is required as you weave and jump past obstacles and platforms, accelerate through boosts orbs and shoot pesky robots. \n\nAstral Traveler is hard but fair. Whenever I fail I don't feel it's the game's fault, I know I'm the one that messed up.\n\nI really love playing in first person, but unfortunately it doesn't click well when a track transitions from ground to air. There's a glowing pad to help show where you are in relation to the track's walls, but it doesn't help much.\n\nOverall Astral Traveler is great fun. Good music, fast paced, and satisfying to beat your high score. I highly recommend picking it up.", "recommendationid": "34964801", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505453841, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 170, "playtime_forever": 133, "last_played": 1505584504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037178823"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
