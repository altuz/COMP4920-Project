I have never seen that before! \n\nDecent graphics options and optimisation. \n\nThe gameplay though is just super rough. You start with no weapons and either find one in the world of melee (see: nudge) your attackers to kill them and take their weapons. In some arenas it is super difficult to even move past the entrance before dying.\n\nOne main issue I have with this game is in the description of the game itself. The game seems to have entered early access with no clear timeline for features, and even says they don't have a clear idea of all the features they want in the game. \n\nGiven some polish and listening to feedback this could be a highly recommended game for it's price.\n\nIf you want more opinions and a walkthrough of a few levels check out my video here: https://youtu.be/S8Dlbqk8OaI", "recommendationid": "33758446", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "timestamp_created": 1500869660, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 21, "last_played": 1500869365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198396352139"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500448260, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Shows some promise as an early access title including at the least some decent-looking visuals  and a variety of weapons to use. Unfortunately the gameplay itself feels rather clunky at its current state, and there is little to the levels beyond 'kill all the bad guys / robots.' The aiming (with mouse) feels pretty imprecise and the weapons you do acquire aren't anything that hasn't been seen before, from a generic sniper rifle that feels like it was ripped straight from the AWP in Counter Strike 1.6 to an AK to a crowbar for melee, none of the weapons feel particularly satisfying to use on the robotic enemies who just kind of slump over after you hit them. The game offers 4 levels with either a Rush mode or a Survival mode, but I didn't bother to try too much of either one as on Rush you seem way underpowered confronting the various enemies who seem to have super accurate shots while you fiddle around to line up your own, and the one Survival level I tried on the skyscrapers lead to me somehow being ejected from the wire I was gliding along to be stuck in a lower floor of a skyscraper with no way back to the top to continue to take out enemies and complete the level. \n\nIt unfortunately feels like a mish mash of various parts of other games, with the sounds and graphics being the best part and everything else inbetween feeling unfinished. The base shooting and level design isn't bad, and with some more polish to the animations or more wow factor to the guns you use or more of a through line of purpose in the overarcing gameplay (score attacks, medals, unlock new weapons, something??) it could be decent. I realize the game is in early access, but hopefully the game discovers more of its own soul in the future because as of right now it feels pretty thin and pointless, and seems to be of a much lower overall cohesion or quality than the current trailer would allude to.", "recommendationid": "33646068", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504237", "timestamp_created": 1500448155, "author": {"num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 11, "last_played": 1500447184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499618917, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 8, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This game just does not work properly. the game runs SOO bad. I have the 750 ti which can run most games in 1080p 60 fps but this game runs really bad. even in the lowest settings. the multiplayer doesnt work at all, the melee litterally does NOT work at all, and the mouse sensitivity is even more broken! the sensitivity was set to the max and the aiming was still REALLY SLOW!!! I even put my mouse to 9000 dpi with the highest sensitibity and it was smoothe for like a minute but then it started being really slow AGAIN! and it makes it worse with the lag! also in survival, the guys upstairs dont even come after you. They just wait until you come up the stairs to kill you. They just mow you down as soon as you get up the stairs no matter how much health you have you just die instantly! I really like the consept of this game but it really needs some work before I will ever play it again. I don't really recommend this game yet.
