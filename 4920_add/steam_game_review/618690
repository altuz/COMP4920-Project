It is very, very inspired from the 90's DOOM game, from the fast-paced action, lack of reloading, and hoards of enemies to kill with a large arsenal, all the way down to the map style and level design. It brings all the thrills back from the 90's and packages it with some modern technology such as dynamic lighting, true 3D models, better animation, and an amazing soundtrack. If you loved DOOM back then, you will absolutely love this game now. Hell, even if you didn't love DOOM, you'll still love this game. \n\n\nP.S. I remember when this game was released on the Google Chrome store, and I played it then and loved it. It has grown so much since then, great job, dev!", "recommendationid": "34248169", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510576", "timestamp_created": 1502766735, "author": {"num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 48, "last_played": 1502766333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198202961660"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
