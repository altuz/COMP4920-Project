She\u2019s the type of person to develop better the more she works.  Miwashiba did a splendid job on this one. The art is simple -but simply beautiful; giving off her unique sense of cuteness. It's really colourfull, and nice! The hairstyles, and outfits are really intersting too! Not so mention the characters whos are really cool, and well done.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, but working well: It's a 2D game, you go around talking to people and stuff. That\u2019s the main gameplay element. It may seem boring, but the story prevents that from being too repetitive. Sometimes (at the important events) there are an action called \"Talking Time\", where you have to use your logic, and get the facts together. They are somewhat challenging, you need to pay attention. (if you enable tips, it will be easier, and i really recommend it, otherwise it can be frustrating.) The characters are unique, you wont get bored quickly, while trying to befriend them.\n\nThe music is really cool, and wont get boring. The unique themes for every level, and for conservations really stands out.\n\nI played Miwasiba's previous games, and i do like them very much, but i have to claim this is her best game so far.\nSubjective Rate : 10/10\nI definitely recommend this gem!", "recommendationid": "34764088", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517453", "timestamp_created": 1504643369, "author": {"num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 153, "playtime_forever": 1109, "last_played": 1507149264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 439, "steamid": "76561198153746350"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505719347, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very fun and colorful game that changed my life. It's definately up therein my top 10, maybe even #1 by pure merit of how it emotionally helped me in so many ways.\n\nThis game is essentially danganronpa without death, with the funnyness of ace attourney, and style of TWEWY. The art in this is GORGEOUS. And the seiyuu's are pretty good. Most of the music is creative commons, but that ending theme original song is a bop. If you enjoy light feel good games with an interesting plot, futuristic game settings, RPGMaker-esque games, and any of the above mentioned games, then I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy in this game.

Its gameplay consists of absorbing information and deducing from them. \n\nThe investigation time (Talking Time) is not too difficult as there is no time limit and the amount of lives given for incorrect answers are massive.\n\nOverall it is heavily depandent on its side character developments as there are over 30 of them which amounts to 10+ hours  of gameplay. Fret not as the side stories are not needed to complete the game but feels good to read if played anyways.\n\nIn my Opinion, i have really enjoyed this game and will reccomend it to people who wants to experience a short story and a few puzzles.", "recommendationid": "34883470", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500919", "timestamp_created": 1505139045, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 1162, "last_played": 1504507054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198073862092"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505320522, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Held off on writing a short review for this until the sound issue was fixed, which I'm glad they did. I'll do another playthrough sometime soon.\n\nThis game is very well-written. Main story aside, you can get the most out of this game by befriending all the available characters, which the game recommends you do. The art in this game is simply beautiful, with well-drawn characters and backgrounds. The actual game isn't too difficult as you can enable hints, plus you can take your time to go through the dialogue over and over in talking time if you want to. The mini-games you can play in free time are just there if you already used the cheat to max your bits, so it's mostly an optional thing unless you don't mind playing the hell out of Tetris or Puyo Puyo to grind bits for gifts. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game if you like a good story and a well-written cast of characters, not to mention amazing artwork.
