Good length for the price.\n\nThe atmosphere / style is reminiscent of Abode. Sharp, clean visuals and sound with a strong sense of theme. So for the environment, I'll give it an A.\nThe puzzles were good. Fairly standard per the genre, but nicely incorporated into the room. Easy level took about 10 minutes. Hard only took me another 15 minutes as there were no new elements, but some increase in challenge per puzzle. Gameplay gets a B+.\n\nOverall, very nice. It's one I'm keeping, as it's short but challenging. A perfect escape room to share with anyone. Kids and adults can enjoy it, and finish in a reasonable amount of time too. Well done. I hope to see more of your work in the future. :)\n\nEDIT:\nThe developer was quick to respond and all issues I reported have been fixed. Teleportation is solid and the tumblers are much more responsive.", "recommendationid": "31009879", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525214", "timestamp_created": 1491625535, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_forever": 456, "last_played": 1503727298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024908549"}, "votes_up": 13}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497920225, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It make good use of VR to create an easy and hard escape room.

It does contain some skill based obstacles which may be frustrating to people who only want puzzles/riddles, but I enjoyed them all.\n\nSo I'll just say it again: If you liked Abode (or any well done room escape games) definitely check this out.", "recommendationid": "31154732", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1492257066, "author": {"num_reviews": 43, "num_games_owned": 476, "playtime_forever": 35, "last_played": 1492211969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040654274"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493570417, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very well made puzzle room.\n\nIt's really two puzzle rooms in one:\nAfter you beat it on Easy, you play again on Hard.\n\nNice graphic style.
