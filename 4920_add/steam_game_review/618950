Compared to other games, \"Agatha Knife\" is a very unique game with a very interesting story and gameplay. I would describe it as an addictive game from just playing 10 minutes in, the music is very pleasant and suits the game very well. \"Agatha Knife\" also have fun puzzles that you need to solve, some a bit harder than another. You will defenetily find yourself stuck in the game with a \"must\" to continue til' you finish the game.\n\n\"Agatha Knife\" is a really fun game and it puts you into a lot of thinking, it has both a weird and funny story and I would lie if I didn't say that I loved it for every minute I've played. I love how they put in for an example; One-Punch man and Hatsune Miku in the comic store as well with other known characters. I would definitely say that my money was well spent when I bought the [i]Pyschotic Adventures Bundle[/i]. \n\nAgatha is a 7-year old girl that struggles from insomniac and her love for meat and animals.\nOne day Agatha's mother Mrs Knife realise that the business in their Butcher shop goes poorly, she decided to take Agatha to the church in hope to make everything go great again. Agatha decides to get herself into making her own \"religion\" which in this case is \"Carnivorism\". In order to successfully \"create\" the Carnivorism and help her mother, Agatha finds herself in challenging situations. You as the player have to think and make the tasks reasonable in order to help Agatha with her belief to make the animals unafraid of death. You get to experience the life of the very unusual life of little Agatha and learn more about her way to handle things. \n\n\n[b]Positive view over the game:[/b]\n\u2023 The game has an unusual and unique story.\n\u2023 The music suits the game.\n\u2023 The game is addictive.\n\u2023 The achievements are fun and they look cool.\n\u2023 The game has some fun puzzles as well as some challenging tasks.\n\u2023 It's easy to save the game so you quick can come back from where you left it.\n\u2023 There is some interesting charachters with different personalities.\n\u2023 Cool emoticons and backgrounds as well as badges.\n\n[strike][b]Negative view over the game:[/b][/strike]\n\u2023 There's nothing negative about the game in my opinion.", "recommendationid": "34763113", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504600", "timestamp_created": 1504639702, "author": {"num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 270, "playtime_forever": 971, "last_played": 1504633659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198161472299"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 21, "total_positive": 21, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
