So it had an impact on me straight away! The gameplay itself is lively if a tad simplistic (it is certainly an \"arcade\" game). Graphics are good and I felt no sickness playing it through the Rift. Cons: though you can play it with the Touch controllers there is a limit to what you can do (for example you cannot pick up weapons or throw objects). And there is no save game option, though given the arcade nature of the game this may be acceptable. Overall a decent VR game for the money.", "recommendationid": "31372747", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1493200732, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 70, "last_played": 1507061751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "steamid": "76561198383754553"}, "votes_up": 0}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
