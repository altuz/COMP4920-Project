Relaxing.\n\nCons:\n\n- Not as many features as could be possible in the future. Again, it's Early Access and I hope more stuff gets added.\n- No options system, cannot adjust resolution or game settings. Not that it matters, since you can run this game on a microwave.\n- No fullscreen windowed option.\n- LOCKED AT 30 FPS.\n\nPossible bugs:\n\n- Science module can't be adjusted after setting research. Maybe intentional, maybe not.\n- Scientist \"people\" disappear after the first night.\n- Money doesn't actually update, making it impossible to actually get money in Career mode.\n- For some reason the communication module doesn't show up on Creative mode.\n- NO POWER icon shows up even with proper power. Doesn't charge the power banks.\n\nOther noteworthy items:\n\n- Low on features, not many modules. I blame Early Access.\n- Nothing really risk causing besides research failures and loans. As long as you make enough to net a profit you can play the waiting game to increase your station size.\n- Zooming out is with right click + scroll, which is pretty weird.\n- Zooming out makes the stars scale out making the pattern very visible. I actually thought it was a grid system until I realized it was just the really big stars showing with the smaller ones disappearing. I'd recommend making a really really big star texture and repeating it less.\n- There's a LOT of space to build a big station, assuming you can actually make it.\n- I don't believe there's a way to deconstruct a module for better layout later on.\n\nOverall: 3/10. Score will increase as more stuff gets added and more replayability. I'll mark it recommended because lots of work went into this.", "recommendationid": "31051242", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536651", "timestamp_created": 1491782332, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 34, "last_played": 1491781482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198089800997"}, "votes_up": 23}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495654340, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "You construct a space station, fill it with crew and modules, try to make money and expand your space station.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, you have pretty much seen everything.
