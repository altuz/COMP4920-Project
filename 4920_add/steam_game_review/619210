It costs way too much for a game that's newly in development, experimental and lacks a lot of content to keep users playing for more than an hour.\n\nIt's neat to try and make something that only had basic simulators online into a fully interactive game, however, for something that's merely new and not proven 100% accurate through math, even in the real world,, in terms of 4d physics, the price should be lower than $15.00. If I were the devs I'd make the price $5.00\n\nAlso, the game needs a lot more content than it does right now for users to keep playing.\n\nTo fix the problem above, I'd suggest adding configurations and properties to both the 4d objects and space/physics. Maybe make it a Geometry Sandbox, and 4d is only an option you can toggle.", "recommendationid": "34748839", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497749", "timestamp_created": 1504581525, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 178, "last_played": 1504591386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075133835"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 36, "total_positive": 32, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
