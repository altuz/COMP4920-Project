Check.\n\nMonarchy? Check.\n\nSisi?! Check.\n\nLocal \"german\" developers? Check.\n\nRecommendation? Check!\n\n\nI like it, its great for small sessions and provides a lot of tactical depth. At first i thought this was a CCG (like Hearthstone and Faeria), but its not, from what i see. You have all the cards available, but you start your game with only some of them which you then use to \"buy\" more. The bought cards get added to your deck and can be used to buy even more cards. If youve played War of Omens you know how this works.\n\n\nThings that were not perfect:\n\nThe tutorial is really confusing, but after 1 game vs AI everything became clear.\n\nThere is no story-mode (yet), but its EA and the devs are active.\n\nThe game lacks a bit diversity, especially in the last turns where all cards are bought. Maybe force the game to end in the next few turns after all cards are bought? Or let the player reuse all discarded cards for infinite combos?\n\nAnyways, i think its worth 15\u20ac and i recommend it.\n\n", "recommendationid": "35455310", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513501", "timestamp_created": 1507060118, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 337, "playtime_forever": 125, "last_played": 1507135273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "steamid": "76561198002458772"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507193213, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love the theme and becouse you got all the cards from the start defenetly wroth that 10\u00a3.
