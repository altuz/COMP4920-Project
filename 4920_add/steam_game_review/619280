A very nice experience, don't expect more than a few hours of gameplay unless you want to go for every achievements, but these were very enjoyable hours. The latest (free!) patch adds more monsters, items and endings, and was enough to get me to play this great game again.", "recommendationid": "35178780", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506253984, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 926, "last_played": 1506253788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "steamid": "76561198022472972"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 37, "total_positive": 30, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
