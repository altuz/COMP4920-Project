This game should have more options and should be optimized for low end pcs. Also there are only 2 weapons in the game and I also expected this game to be more wacky and fun. For example you would get a rocket launcher to blow some ducks up ! or something silly like that. This game is poorly translated and in my opinion it's not worth playing it right now.
