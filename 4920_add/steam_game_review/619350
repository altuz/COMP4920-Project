That said, the game was pretty disappointing to me. If you like the webcomic and are always hungry for more like me, then it may be well worth it to go through the game for seeing more of the characters and all that- but they don't quite shine as well here. I finished to the end in anticipation of an interesting story, but the ending felt very abrupt and anticlimatic. \n\nWhere to start? The graphics are...okay. The animations were pretty awful. They were very stiff slow and choppy and kept making awkward pauses in the dialogue that really interrupted the flow of the action. The sound effects? My ears were bleeding (especially that one re-used kiss sound effect oh god).\nThe voice-acting (in English) was all over the place, some of them were okay or pretty good (thankfully Larisa was still pretty awesome) while some sounded like grandpa in a skype call with a $2 mic.\n\nThe actual dialogue was pretty amusing. Again, Larisa is best.\nThe point-&-click stuff was pretty neat, though some parts were a bit too nonsensical/abstract to really solve except hoping to stumble onto it by chance. Then again, I haven't played too much point-and-click, so maybe I'm just really bad at them. I often got stuck trying every combination over and over only to finally realize I overlooked the simplest actions.\n\nThe minigames were simple but challenging enough to be fun imo. Plus, the CD's were a nice touch for when they could get too frustrating.\n\nPersonally, I would have really enjoyed it if the game's story took place more in the actual setting of the comic and used more of their existing characters that fans would love to see. It would be awesome exploring places that fit into the comic, like the school, cloud's house, the forest, the various places of the city- lots of potential there. Frankly it was hard to feel invested in that medieval setting with its short-lived characters who were little more than walking parodies of a genre. \nIf they made another game established more firmly in the comic's setting with more of its characters, I'd likely go back for more despite the various technical drawbacks. (please please fix that kiss sound effect though or it'll turn otherwise cute scenes into really cringey moments D:)\n\nSo, overall...I feel they could have invested much more time and effort into the quality of the animation and sound. Either that or lower the price to match what was put into it. Definitely room for improvement in the character models but was passable. Would definitely be more appealing with more focus on the comic's setting/characters imo. Good for some laughs and basking in Larisa's firey glory but probably not recommended for people unfamiliar with the webcomic. (then again, I'd recommend them the comic first).\n\n------------------------------------------\nEdit: \nIn hindsight, just thought I'd throw this bit of clarification in. I really wavered over giving this a thumbs up or thumbs down because, honestly, that depends on the context of whether you're going in as a Sandra and Woo fan or not. \n\nOn one hand, I don't regret buying and playing it- I wanted to support the author anyways, and it was interesting to go through as a fan. I'm also being a bit of a critical arse in that spirit, out of that sort of respect and expectation of a series I love. I would hope that other fans will invest in this as well, and hope a sequel may be made that will outdo the first.\n\nThat said, I ultimately concluded that this game will probably not appeal to the average Steam user to happen upon it, and decided to vote within that context.", "recommendationid": "31800640", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541125", "timestamp_created": 1495007351, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_forever": 640, "last_played": 1495003435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024440957"}, "votes_up": 19}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494440923, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game was pretty fun. Very challenging, I must admit I needed a guide more than once! But even so I was able to get by often and challenge my thinking and solve things all on my own. The story is based on wacky happenings but still captivating nonetheless. The minigames test your memory and spatial reasoning. The backgrounds are excellent and while the animation is sometimes choppy the characters come alive just like the point and click adventure games of yore. I must admit I haven't played one in a long time but this game definitely brings back memories. And if you're a regular read of the Sandra and Woo comic series I definitely recommend this; it was very neat seeing characters come to life in new ways! Overall, fun story and good adventure gameplay with fitting voice actors (usually) and good music, sometimes VERY catchy.

Absolutely nothing makes any sense.
