{"reviews": [{"timestamp_updated": 1507088066, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "World of Castles right now (as of 9/16/17)  is a early access  title that allows you  to create a castle to your  image. The  game being new has a very large amount of potential of being the next big medieval title. People say the game is bad but they most likely don't even have enough hours in the game to experience it. I spent the first 6.8 hours after the game came out just building a castle. I cannot deny that there is bugs and glitches, but your talking about a game made by a team of four on a lowish budget. The game can be quite confusing at first and even frustrating. As soon as you get the hang of the game you too will most likely spend hours on this game working on the very best castle. The creators did a good job giving you freedom to build however you want. I talked with one of the creators and combat should hopefully be out by the end of 2017 (no promises.) The game can be laggy when having alot of grass or torches. If there was a tutorial I most likely would have been less frustrated at the game when trying to deal with the terrain. The one thing that will make you want to kill yourself in this game is dealing with the terrain for the first time. The creators have been working nonstop to bring you the best game they can in the limited amount of time they have. They work late at night just so you, the player, can enjoy yourself in their game. Most people see the potential in this game and want it to be the best. Calling the game shit when you have played less than two hours doesn't help anyone and it makes this beautiful game look terrible because you couldn't play it for one more hour.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nThe graphics of the game, I have to admit, pretty bad. I don't blame them for this since once again, only four people are working on it. I thought they were good for their development team. The creaters of this wonderful game plan to improve the lag caused by torches and grass.\n\nEDIT: I have a a decent graphics card and I can run the game with a huge castle at high graphics at about 20 fps. Bad but still good enough for early access\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b] NPCs [/b]\nThe NPCs as of (9/16/17) cannot move around or else they will die. All the NPCs can do is just stand there and look pretty. This NPC glitch should be fixed soon but is probs not a top priority. As long as I can have what they said we could do which is sieging with NPCs then I am happy.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b] Building [/b]\nThe building in the game is very confusing at first and it is the only thing in the game currently so I will go over it. Pressing tab brings up a menu of blocks, walls, decorations, etc that you can use in the game. 10 of the circles will have a number under it. The numbers are the buttons you press to access that category of building when you leave tab. When in tab you can change which category of building goes to which number. Once you have your hotkeys set up you can leave the tab menu and start building. E and Q change the item on the very bottem of the scroll wheel at the bottem of the screen. You can select what item you want with E and Q to place. To see what you have selected look at the bottem of the screen. The selected item will have two lines on the side of the item. I do not want to go over terraforming since it will make me want to kms again. Left click places the object and right click breaks the object. You can place NPCs the exact same way. You can assign them to patrols (dont until the glitch is fixed) by selecting the marching soldier with E or Q then left clicking the soldier. Once you have done this right click the spot you want him to go. Holding Shift allows you to make a pathway.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b] Singeplayer: [/b]\nNot out yet but from what I have heard it sounds very good.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b] Multiplayer: [/b]\nSame as singleplayer.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b] Combat [/B]\nNot out yet but will be soon.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank you for reading my review, I hope I didn't miss anything important to discuss about. If you really want my rating of the game so far here it is:\n8/10\nWhy 8/10? Because the building is well done and I will not rate the entire game untill everything comes out.

BUYER BEWARE, however, because it is not feature complete and does not include any form of combat in its current state.\n\nUnderstand what you're getting in this Early Access form of the game.  If you enjoy castle building, it is a wonderful game already for that aspect.  If you were expecting combat, you may want to hold off a bit until those features are in place.  Know what you're getting yourself into when you purchase the game and you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nDevelopers are very driven to work with the community as well, so that is a huge plus.
