I dreaded every movement for fear of what consequence it might bring. The atmosphere was intense and I was truely scared of the threats that loomed before me.... \nAnd then the game became an instant disappointment when the core gameplay began. It turns out the section I was so enthralled with was nothing more than a prologue which was leading to a horrible disappointment. The actual gameplay turned out to be nothing more than a simple game of keep away with a \"monster\" that was comically non-threatening and who, when he caught you, proceeded to do nothing more than repeatedly stab at you in a poorly animated motion that slowly ticked down the players health bar.\n\nThe breaking of the mood in this game and the poor gameplay that ensued was a massive dissapointment since the introduction was so effective at putting me on edge. \nA solid premise but horrendous execution.", "recommendationid": "34766980", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503968", "timestamp_created": 1504657825, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 178, "playtime_forever": 66, "last_played": 1504248782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198131603790"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 23, "total_positive": 18, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
