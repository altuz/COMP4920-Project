They also went ahead and deleted every thread on their discussion boards related to the missing files.\n\nDestruction 48 launched with missing gamefiles resulting in an unplayable product.

After the 0.3 hours it took to apparently complete this, I'm still unsure of what the actual fuck I experienced...\n\nSo what to expect from playing this, the level design is at times confusing with where you left the previous screen not really matching up to the next screen you enter. Also parts of the levels you would expect to be blocked off you're able to easily walk through whilst other parts you would think you can walk to are blocked off by invisible walls. In fact a lot of the design lacks consistency. Plus I personally liked the glitch in which the game recognises a baseball bat as an equiable helmet, in which when you try to do so an error message will display and the game starts to act like its about to crash.\n\nThe combat is basically face the enemy and attack, at this point you will notice if you're using a gun the bad hit detection. The game gives you a huge amount of melee weapons, most of which you will most likely want to avoid as there doesn't seem to be a way to avoid taking damage in close range (not that it really matters with the 800 odd medkits the game throws at you). All the enemies will basically move towards you, unless they get confused and move off screen for some reason, the only vartiety being is that some enemies have more health than others. I also personally like the grenades in which once thrown, bounce off what ever they hit and head back in the direction they came. There is also a magic system, not that I would know as spending the short amount of time that I did with this was painful enough.\n\nSome areas have a 30 second sound loop of chirping birds which seems to cut out and then start to replay at a lower volume. Other areas have absolutely no sound at all. You will think this is bad until you actually reach areas that do have music, in which feels just as painful as having wisdom teeth removed under local anesthetic, honestly sandpaper is less abrasive.\n\nIt's sad but if this game had spent more time in development and was refined, it could of been a fun little game to play. But instead feels like it was thrown together on a lazy Sunday afternoon and chucked up on Steam because the developer had that months rent due or wanted to pay off some of their drug debts. This isn't worth 0.99 cents let alone the $1.99 US the dev is asking.", "recommendationid": "32357683", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534728", "timestamp_created": 1497241123, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 269, "playtime_forever": 17, "last_played": 1497238489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082931104"}, "votes_up": 23}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497182674, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 45, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "I managed to start a game, started okay.
