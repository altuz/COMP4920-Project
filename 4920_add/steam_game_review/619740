You can also be treated to falling through the floor and dying as well, after which there is a good chance the game will also crash. Although I've never played the slenderman game this game appears to be \"immitating\" it. It has a nonsensical plot and attempts to be both 2spookyf4U and 2deep4U with it's cutscenes but fails. Had a bit more work gone into it I think it could have had potential, even though it is just stock assets, but as it stands it's buggy mess with silly jumpscares.\n\nSee for yourself:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOxucAD4jc", "recommendationid": "31294674", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512506", "timestamp_created": 1492860231, "author": {"num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 913, "playtime_forever": 119, "last_played": 1492745357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987783860"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492519807, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I cannot recommend this game at ALL - after 45 minutes I had to stop playing, from the frequent crashes at load screens, completely 'out of left field' jumpscares and the story - I can't tell you what the story actually is - from one load screen to another (which are LONG, mind you) it seems like a different game of sorts, very disjointed.  \n\nThe subtitles in English are choppy and broken - distracting.  And Slenderman (YES this is SLENDERMAN, don't let anyone tell you otherwise) can pretty much snag you at any moment without warning or a sliver of a chance to look away or run.  When I finally got 7/8 notes and turned around, took 2 steps and he popped without any warning in my face and cause immediate death I was done - I tried about a dozen times to get those notes.\n\nIt's one thing for a game to be difficult, or set an eerie tone so you feel compelled to sneak around and carefully search for the notes.  It's another to not see him or any hint of him and then when you are almost done he pops in front of you and says NOPE.\n \nYes it's $2.54 but this is Gamejolt or Itch.io fodder, and that is even giving it a compliment.  I do hate to crap on a game, but this definitely does not deserve to be on Steam.  \n\nIf you want to see my craptastic time playing it here you go!  https://youtu.be/7jpfRz-rnxE\n\n", "recommendationid": "31217842", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508011", "timestamp_created": 1492519807, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 114, "playtime_forever": 39, "last_played": 1492489637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198243611276"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492979949, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "As others have said the only thing inevitable about this game is the crashes, Really long loading screens, and boring jump scares accompanied by the classic deafeningly loud screams and growls.

So many elements from that successful horror series can be found in the this game. From the note fetch quests, to the way the main evil \"entity\" is designed, and how he follows/interacts with you when he closes in, basically feels ripped straight from the other Slender games. \nHowever, this game does add it's own flair into the mix during breaks between plot/ location changes. Reminded me a bit of a mix between PT and A Girl's Fabric Face. \n\nSound is such a huge part of any succesfful horror venture, and I will say this this. The sound in this game is very well done. Between ominous background groans, shrieks, static noises from hell. Your characters own footsteps echoing off of the grimy, glass shattered tile floor-- It all comes together in a very impressive way. Even the moments of music I found to be well selected and enjoyable.\n\nIs it actually scary though? I guess that depends on your definition of scary. From what I've seen, it relies on omnious atmosphere, the fear of being chased, and of course jump scares. The jump scares I've encounctered so far were decently done. A few actually did make me literally jump. \n\nThe story is pretty forgettible and nonsensical so far unfortunately. Your family is dead. You show up in a seemingly abandoned subway station, and Mr. 'Not Slender Man' is there to great you, and chase your sorry ass all across the world...just because. I'll edit the review if more explination is given towards the end of the game, but as of now it's pretty much just whatever. \n\nThere are very long loading times, and they can and will break the game. I probably had the game kick me out during the load screen 5 times during a 45 mintue play through. That for sure needs to be addressed.\n\nAll in all, considering the price, I'd give The Inevitability a 6.5 out of 10. (Without the load crashes, I'd bump it up to a 7-7.5) If you love the Slender Man series, or that genre of horror games in general, than you are pretty much set to enjoy this game. If that isn't your cup of tea, then I'd avoid this. There won't be much here to hold you interest. I will include a video I made of a playthrough of the first 3 'areas', if you are curious as to what the game actually looks, sounds, and feels like. I included the loading shenanigans as well, because sometimes it was pretty funny.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmkqOp2_kw0&t=1416s", "recommendationid": "31213446", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495428", "timestamp_created": 1492498211, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_forever": 323, "last_played": 1493243870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198347054336"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492523406, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "Can't recommened it at all everyone who played it knows its a ripoff of slenderman so i didnt enjoy it at all.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8Chq37ij6T4", "recommendationid": "31218795", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489939", "timestamp_created": 1492523406, "author": {"num_reviews": 104, "num_games_owned": 234, "playtime_forever": 33, "last_played": 1492520657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079664351"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
