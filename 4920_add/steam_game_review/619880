BUT! A big butt here. This is the one time I wish a game *was* in beta. Because, while the game is great, I feel it's not finished yet. Like. Why aren't there multiple maps? The match making is kind of meh. It's not horrible, but it could be allot faster. \n\nThe gameplay is hands down fun as hek.  It doesn't matter if your getting wrecked, or if you're a raptor or an Omega, each stage is fun to play and it has great replay ability. Also the sounds and visuals are just orgasmically awesome. \n\nHOWEVER! I can totally see this game dying on the vine within the first two months, and being forgotten like our disappointing friend No Mans Sky over there. Mainly because there's ONLY ONE MAP! \nWhy they thought this was a smart move, I don't know, but it's going to hurt the game. We need [b]game-modes[/b], we need [b]maps[/b], we need to be able to choose [b]community servers.[/b] I mean, come on. This game really feels half baked in this area. \n\nGreat game. My only beef is that there isn't enough of it. So, consider that a compliment? But also like, c'mon Ubisoft. Stop holding out on us.

The most powerful Omega form only lasts for a short time so you have to make the most out of it. After the Omega timer ends you are revert back to the Atom.\n\nEvery form feels a little bit different to control and they are all pretty fun. The game itself emphasis on evading larger life-forms and predating lessor ones, while securing your territory to collect all the mass. You can win a fight against a larger enemy, but that's extremely hard, so you have to play by the rules: collect, pray and hide.\n\nThe best part of this game is that it offers a brand new experience: it's like a jungle simulator where you are both the predator and the pary, fighting your way to become the apex predator and get to the top of the leaderboard.\n\nStill the game feels a little bare-bone. You have no way to customize the abilities of your life-form other than the random pick up from the map, and (as far as I know) there is only one game mode and a single map. And you cannot team up with your friends (you can invite them into a game, but cannot play as a team). The game has so much potential, I really hope they will add more features in the future.\n\nStill, the game is lots of fun and totally worth the price.", "recommendationid": "35066844", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569441", "timestamp_created": 1505835621, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 182, "last_played": 1506076507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "steamid": "76561198125743694"}, "votes_up": 49}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505834931, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "After 50 minutes my first impression.

No long tutorial, no convoluted controls. Just a nice, solid, fast-paced game. And while I do believe that there could be many things to add to the game, such as a few more different arenas, some game modes, a versus A.I., and maybe even different exoforms (perhaps different variants), the price is very fair for this game.\n\nThere's just one thing I'm worried about, though.\n\nThe playerbase is very low, and the game could very well end up dead on arrival. This would be especially bad if no bot mode were implemented where, at the very least, you could skirmish by yourself with A.I. controlled enemies.
