No true controller support. mapping my controler myself is not controller support. (this is called lying) secondly even if i do map it myself it has clunky controls as its set up to aim with a mouse, and not function like a twin stick shooter (which this game truly is by design) so heres an idea... make it work with twin sticks!", "recommendationid": "34324541", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501248", "timestamp_created": 1503048526, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 127, "playtime_forever": 10, "last_played": 1503361545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072394110"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
