There are goals for each level, like match 50 frogs.  As you go along the game there are obstacles like ice and snow that can only be removed by matching (can't move the frozen item) or by using a bonus.  Also some levels require all the tiles to be turned to gold, which sometimes requires multiple matches.\n\nBonuses!  If you match a 4 or 5 in a row you get a bonus item.  Click on it and a specific thing will happen.  Lightning bolt will clear everything in a vertical column.  Lucky Clover will fire diagonal fireballs in four directions.  Hammer will let you choose an ice square to hit.  Etc.\n\nThere are 2 modes: Timed and Relaxed (untimed).  \n\nNo achievements so far :-(\n\nThere are cute backgrounds that you can save to your desktop (if you can stand the cuteness without imploding, that is!)\n\nI bought my copy on Steam when it first came out.", "recommendationid": "31402170", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516656", "timestamp_created": 1493327332, "author": {"num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 3499, "playtime_forever": 322, "last_played": 1504904587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064050389"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492110361, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Solid match 3 game play from this developer again.
