Hit N O and Ok.\n\n\n\nSeriously good enough that I still play it today? \"Mr. Gets Bored With Games After Five Minutes.\"\nRelease Windows. EU: May 23, 2003. Also when I first picked it up.\nToday. Sep 12, 2017.\n\nSurprisingly I also found out today it still has an active mod community outside Steam and Steam discussion is still active. Using 4 new ghosts that were always within the game but never released now. GM has also aged well enough that besides the resolution you can't really tell it's an old game and not a recent indie. Still hoping for a Ghost Master 2 whether it's fan-made or not.\n\nCaveat: There might be problems getting it to run for some people. I remember I had to do something like swap the .exe for another. I don't see any others reporting this problem lately though."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505064575, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34867174", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198019579817", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1494528638, "num_games_owned": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 802}, "timestamp_updated": 1505064575, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Brilliant retro experience. One of my favourite games growing up, and it holds up even now! For \u00a33.99 it's a steal, and currently it's on sale for \u00a30.99, which is less than bus fare and 10000000x more enjoyable. The gameplay runs as a sort of management and puzzle solving game, with the added benefit of collecting ghosts. Each ghost has a backstory and skills, and you have to utilise them all to solve the various levels, each of which is based on a film - often horror, but sometimes not. \n\nDefinitely worth the price tag."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506372698, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35210442", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198250552922", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505850929, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 124}, "timestamp_updated": 1506372698, "received_for_free": false, "review": "After standing the tests of time it still is one of the most creative, unique and just uncanny games out there. It pains me greatly that there's no sequel to this masterpiece.\n\nFirst off the game is awesome, unlocking ghosts through the entire playthrough while buying upgrades with plasm you earn with how well and fast you perform through levels. It gives your favourite ghosts new powers and can branch off between two choices\n\nYou start with a reasonable amount of ghosts but your army amasses as you save ghosts from their objects/past by solving puzzles. The AI functions surprisingly well and a lot of details have been put in the game like lakes freezing when you use freezing enviroment moves.\n\nI don't want to spoil much because playing it for the first time is a true journey, the puzzle levels can be punishing near the end level and the massive amount of mortals can be discouraging near the end but it all is worth it all around and can be fun even in its most unfair times."}]}
