[/h1]\n\nWhat's your favorite space strategy game? Many will say FTL. \n\n[b] Well, FTL fans (and space game fans), let me introduce this fantastic game to you! [/b]\n\nIcarus SCS is essentially FTL but in first person. Sure, it's a bit rough around the edges but once you look past all of that, a really complex and fun game lies underneath! In some cases, it's even more complex than FTL! \n\nThe main premise is basically the same. You have to get somewhere quickly, and you can jump around in a fixed \"sector-by-sector\" kind of path. Every \"sector\" you will come across a random encounter, whether it be a random enemy or a group of people in need of help. However, this game pushes it just a bit further. The game allows you to hop out of the captain's chair and walk around your ship! You can interact with your crew members, dick around with ship modules, access your captain's log from your computer in your quarters etc. \n\nBut the most fun thing to do that you can't do in FTL is the boarding. That's right, you can jump into a teleporter and get on the enemy's ship! From there, the game turns into a type of FPS, where you have to kill the enemies inside the ship, or stealthily sabotage their ship modules (like sabotaging the oxygen module to make them suffocate!). You can also steal enemy resources and ammo to upgrade your own ship's modules and systems, which allows you to provide more power for systems in need to make encounters a tad easier. You can also bring along a crew with you to the ship, but the game's AI isn't super duper good and you might get hit from friendly fire when facing a ship full of enemies. The sheer amount of cool unscripted action moments from this game make you feel like a classic 90's sci fi hero.\n\nThe game is DIFFICULT. I've started at least 3 playthroughs on the \"easy\" difficult and have died in my first or second jump every time, but every single time has been loads of fun. Keep in mind that you'll need to be patient with the game, as it doesn't explain everything super well to you (like modules, crew functions, etc.), but if you are patient I'm sure the game will reward you.\n\n[h1] TL;DR: [/h1] Overall, this game is very rough around the edges, yes. But if you can bring yourself to get around that, you can find a complex space game, where you'll really feel like a captain of a ship! And for $5? It's a fucking steal!\n\n[h1] [b] Recommended at full price.
