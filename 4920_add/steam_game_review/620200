It's my first game about love relations between men and I enjoyed it sooo much! I want more such games!!! There are some explicit scenes of intimacy and they are so well written, revealing unique qualities of every character. Maybe it's my inexperience in such games but I got used to skipping these scenes after reading them in one route 'cause they just seem to be copied but not here! \nI guess it was accidentally but the plot kept me in real tension 'cause as usual I turned out to choose desicions leading to bad endings first (I still think there must be something wrong with me)) and so I got the answer about what was going on there quite at the end of the game. I liked this feeling of suspense. \nAs for the top character I fell for, again it's my first time)) but it was the protagonist himself, or could I say myself 'cause I was really living his life))) Oh my, Alex is so cute, especially on that picture in the canteen. By the way it would be so nice to have some cards and therefore backgrounds, I'd like to have the one with Alex a lot! \nEvery time after finishing one route when that sign appeared saying \"Thank you for playing\" I kept thinking:\nOh, guys, c'mon, Thank YOU for creating this game!!!", "recommendationid": "35050673", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505849", "timestamp_created": 1505759542, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 238, "playtime_forever": 871, "last_played": 1505743862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198234584076"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505606808, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I had thorough fun with this. I must admit I was quite new to dating sims and graphic novel games with romance and all that, but I liked this one. I felt very entertained, I liked the different characters and plots.\n\nA mild critique: it could have had more facial expressions and different character scenes, maybe also some background characters visible. But, I got it for five Euro, and I got more than enough out of it. I am really glad to see that we get more gay themes games now, and I hope the company continues to make more games like this. :)", "recommendationid": "35010124", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505929", "timestamp_created": 1505606808, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_forever": 268, "last_played": 1505606378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006933199"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505762972, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So far I've finished 2 of the routes. Here are my thoughts:\n\nPROS:\n+ the story is good. it could be better, but overall it's an interesting mystery and setup with a lot of potential.\n+ the characters are not bad. they don't blow me away either, but this is (like the point above) tied to the length of the game (more under cons). the basic characters as they are are really interesting and worth pursuing.\n+ it's an English BL game, which is rare and I'm just happy there is one more to play.\n+ I got this for 5\u20ac on sale and that's pretty much exactly what I'd say the game is worth in its current state.\n\nCONS:\n- it's really short. that would be less of an issue if the story and relationships didn't feel so half-baked and rushed. if the developers spent more time on building the world they created, the game would benefit immensely. there's almost no build-up to the relationships. they happen and that's that. the mystery as well is barely a mystery and even though each route is about 2 hours only, everything seems like a sidenote.\n- the characters I played so far had so much more potential than was realised. they each have pretty big issues that are never properly adressed, and while I don't expect a perfect resolution to everything in this setting, there was just so much potential that was wasted in not using these issues to build the story some more and make the game longer through meaningful interactions with the boys.\n- the quality of the CGs is.... really inconsistent. there's maybe 3 that are really nice and the rest is either meh or genuinely awful. the characters look nothing like themselves in some of them. for a VN this is an absolute death sentence and I cannot believe someone looked at them and thought \"good enough.\"\n- speaking of CGs, there aren't a lot of them either. probably related to how short each route is, but there were several points in each of them where I thought a CG would have made the story better. in the 2 routes I've played so far, there hasn't been a single kiss CG either. again, for a VN that's not good.\n- SPEAKING OF CGs, there isn't a gallery to look at the ones you got either. this is also a bit of an oversight as most people like to go back and look at them after finishing the game. in this case maybe not so much since most of them are genuinely not good, but for the ones that ARE nice, it would be cool to have them to look at without having to play the game again.\n\nAll in all it's an okay game for 5\u20ac. I'd buy it again mainly because I think it's great there's an English BL title on steam, but the truth is, the game itself is not even close to what it could have been, which is a shame. If they fixed the CGs and added an hour of content to each route in which they actually show Alex and the boy of his choice bonding and talking about some deeper issues, it could be a really great experience.

This game is NOT perfect, a few glaring translation errors (too much fisting of hands), some occassionally inconsistency with foreground and background art, inconsistent music and SFX and some frankly daft plot points does not stop this from being actually quite a charming game. I have to admit I was pleased to see a BL VN pop up and I have noticed a few more around steam now and whilst we may not be getting Dramatical Muirder in a legit form any time soon I think it's games like this with the right kind of heart, telling this kind of story which will help us on our way.
