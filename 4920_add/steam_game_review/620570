In fact, some DLC I still haven't played yet, i just get lost in time...and hours of it playing and getting so into what airplane needs my assistance next. \n\nOne thing I can say about this product, as well as the Tower!3D, and Tower3D!PRO, is the DEVs are quick to answer any questions you may have on the forums here, so they are in touch and get back quickly.  That is always a plus!\n\nI'm happy I bought this product.", "recommendationid": "34452757", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "timestamp_created": 1503550949, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 5675, "last_played": 1504060037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025774959"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
