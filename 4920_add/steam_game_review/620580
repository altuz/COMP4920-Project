The jumping is good, with the double jump taking time to get used to.\n+ Not going to break the bank at $2\n\n+/- + Nice graphics for the sprites and worlds. - The world graphics get a bit too much alike\n\n- No controller support\n- No way to customize (controls) keyboard layout (it uses the arrow keys rather than wasd, or at least a and d)\n- Needs a little polishing with the English\n- random tiles that are not actually floor (I know this is a decision for challenge, I find it annoying and cheap)", "recommendationid": "31637100", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508237", "timestamp_created": 1494289888, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 6521, "playtime_forever": 310, "last_played": 1494306961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052831030"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494280063, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Love this game.
