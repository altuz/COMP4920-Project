After initial bad experiences with Nuts!: The Battle of the Bulge (so buggy that it's unplayable) and Battle of Tallarn (plain bad) this one is a pleasant suprise.\n\nPros:\n- should appeal to people that like boardgames, card games and 2WW (preferably all of the mentioned)\n- I haven't encountered any bugs\n- it's fun\n- you can play it during a long coffe break\n- it's pretty and supports resolutions above 1080p\n- interface is allright\n\nCons:\n- price is a little steep for such a small game\n- if you're not going to play multi, there is about 3 hours of single player content to max it out\n- it's a bit too luck dependant cause drawing bad cards on initial hand can cost you a game\n- cards could use a bigger variety", "recommendationid": "33538615", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595962", "timestamp_created": 1500047496, "author": {"num_reviews": 93, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 106, "last_played": 1500059452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006756264"}, "votes_up": 58}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
