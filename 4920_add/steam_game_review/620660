The soundtrack is lovely but not overpowering and despite a few rough edges in game play (some inexact grip/hop mechanics and slightly clunky early combat) this game is addictingly enjoyable. I can't wait to reach the top but I will avoid any spoilers. If you are looking for a fairly polished and physical adventure game that doesnt feel like just another \"demoey\" collection of assets, this is a great buy at full price!\n\nSoooo not disappointed!!!", "recommendationid": "32332431", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524010", "timestamp_created": 1497148501, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 487, "playtime_forever": 206, "last_played": 1502138535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020559310"}, "votes_up": 14}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497489065, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ok the lack of reviews on this game is just sad so I had to write one, I really enjoyed this game even with its current flaws (Devs are working on that). This game for me was like jumping into one of my favorite story books Jack and the beanstalk and it was amazing! So of course based on the story this will be a climbing game but not all the time cause their is also some action as well. You will obtain a sword to be able to fight off creatures on your way up along with other tools to help you on your adventure. The climbing in this game is close to climby which is a good thing in my opinion, just be prepaired to get a good workout in this game. For me it was a blast from start to finish I could not stop until i made it to the top and when I did I was not dissapointed they really put effort into the scale of things so you really get the feeling of how small you are compaired to a giant. Thier is only 1 beanstalk that I have played so far and the devs have more content planed, it was a great time none the less you really should give it a chance if you enjoyed the story of jack and the beanstalk of just climbing games lol. One last thing if you have a fear of heights or not this game will make your feet tingle a few times cause the scenery is beautiful and you will get caught up in it and make you feel like you really are high up!", "recommendationid": "32420189", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521160", "timestamp_created": 1497483239, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_forever": 394, "last_played": 1499298958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001889161"}, "votes_up": 8}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
