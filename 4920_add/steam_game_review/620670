Even in early access (in it's current state) I believe this game is worth the asking price of $2.00.  \n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n-Pleasant looking graphics/artwork\n-Good music and audio\n-Controls are very responsive (with game-pad support)\n-Multiple unlock-able abilities and ammo types, as well many enemies to encounter\n-Decent price point\n-Using abilities in exchange for health makes situations interesting and encourages risk-vs-reward gameplay\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\nSometimes enemies will get stuck on the opposite side of the play area (caught up on a cactus for instance).  The action takes a brief pause during these situations as you search for the last enemy to kill.  Pauses in action generally hurt a game like this (which is meant to be fast paced).", "recommendationid": "31384223", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494537", "timestamp_created": 1493247439, "author": {"num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 34, "last_played": 1493255147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984712587"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493208391, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 12, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "My \"First Play on Launch Day\" First Impressions REVIEW Video:\nhttps://youtu.be/VFzM9fHx73M\n\nNot only does this game get my \"recommend\" but it scored a whopping 95% using my unique scoring criteria that puts the \"value\" a game delivers as the highest part of the score (40% of my overall score is based on gaming \"bang for your dollar\").  I rated this game as my first \"Must Buy!\" game of 2017 and here's why..\n\nA) While the game doesn't offer a lot of fancy options or menus at this early access launch release, it does deliver super fluid and responsive controls that are a joy to play whether you use a controller or the mouse & keyboard.\n\nB) The procedural level generation and special abilities mean that no two games will be exactly the same and will give this game a replay value that you'd only expect in games costing much more.\n\nC) Challenging and progressive gameplay that rewards you for quick timing and risking your health to get out of dangerous situations.\n\nD) The art style and music are both great and help make this game a special game in your Steam library.\n\nIt's an awesome game, especially for the price tag, and I want to personally say \"thank you\" to the developers for offering a fantastic value on that game which they could have easily asked many times their $2,99 price tag for!  I look forward to both playing this game and watching its progress as it goes through its early access period and hopefully only gets better! (psst please add sound and music volume controls, screen resolution settings, customizable keys and buttons etc)\n\nMy Score:  95 out of 100.  - Highly recommended!", "recommendationid": "31372529", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489891", "timestamp_created": 1493199489, "author": {"num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "playtime_forever": 159, "last_played": 1493212532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053422627"}, "votes_up": 12}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493686604, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great mechanics and art style would support a sequel", "recommendationid": "31497700", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495167", "timestamp_created": 1493686604, "author": {"num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1501154306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198219019555"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493269154, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This run-and-gun shooter is super fun.
