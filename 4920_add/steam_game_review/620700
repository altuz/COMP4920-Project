Evil Possession is not a bad game. I repeat, Evil Possession is not a bad game. I just can't say it comes with enough content to be worth paying $8 for.\n\nThe graphics are about average to what you would expect from a higher quality indie title. The sound is good as well. Good creepy back ground ambiance, the 'demon' makes unsettling growling noises while she hunts you down, etc. I had zero crashes or issues running the game on my short play through, which honestly is a rarity with some of these indie games.\n\nThe game delivers early on the scare factors. Creepy dolls, the unsettling noises of your female demon friend as she chases you all over the freaking world while you try to do typical fetch quests such as getting candles, making seance circles, etc. However, after the inital fear wears off, and she kills you a few times, you lose the feeling of fear from her, and it just becomes a battle of will. Seeing as she pops up randomly through the floor, and constantly interrrupts you while you try and do your rituals.  I seriously spent at least 5 mins trying to build one seance circle because she just would not leave me the hell alone.\n\nThe only real negative I have is the length and the replayability of the content. I literally ran through it the first time blind, and after about 40 mins of game play, I'm 95% sure I'm on the last section of the game already. (If there is  more to this game I will 100% come back and edit, and change my score. But judging from the flow of the game, and the other reviewers, I don't think that is the case.) That is just is way too short. I can't see this having a ton of replayability either. Maybe one would want to possibly try out hard mode after beating normal, if you are some sort of twisted masochist or something. On normal she starts getting pretty uh...\"friendly\" after about the 3rd seance circle on.\n\nIf you are just an Indie horror nut, and feel the need to scratch that itch, then you probably would enjoy this game. Like I said, I had fun playing it. I just can't see how there is $8 worth of content to be had. ($8 isn't a lot for a game I know, but I am just basing this off of similar games I've played around this price point) Might be definitely worth picking up if it goes on sale in the future.\n\nI'm going to include a gameplay video I made in the end if you want to get a feel for how the game looks/plays.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCKIaCQYlEs\n\nEdit 05-22-17: I just finished hard mode, and thus the entirety of Evil Possession. Completing the game put me at 9 hrs... I guess you'll have to judge for yourself whether you think that is enough bang for your buck play time wise.\n\nI have to say that the majoirty of that was just spent running from our #1 stalker demon girl, as I searched for candles, seance circle locations, and keys. It was repetitive tasks, but she kept the action somewhat fresh just because you constantly have to run away from her. I just wish the devs included some...ANY story in the game. You are an exorcist. You show up at the house. The owners are gone. You have a bible and an emf reader in your bag...That's it. No background on the girl, the family, the house, you...etc. Missed opportunity there for sure.\n\nAll in all, I had fun with the game. It made for good recording material. But I'm some one who enjoyes chase games like this, slender man, etc. For your average Joe, I'm just not sure there is enough game content to be worth the $8 price tage. That's just my opinion. You'll have to decide for yourself.

I did enjoy the game play and the sound effects were creepy enough, though the jump scare death when she finds you is definitely anticlimactic.

Similar to 'Final Take' and 'The Dolls' in the sense that you are essentially searching for items while playing tag with the monster. The Geieger counter style warning system is a nice touch, and the artistic style is quite impressive too. Ultimately, 'Evil Possession' is about atmosphere and it doesn't disappoint. The combination of expressionistic lighting and aptly unnerving soundtrack combine to keep you on edge right from the get go, making the jump scare/sudden death nature of the game all the more shocking. \n\nThe length of the game is the biggest draw back for it though, as is the fact that unlike some of the high-end indy Horror games there is only so much exploration that can be done. Given that the game's setting is a classical latino hacienda, it's a little disappointing that, unlike 'Layers of Fear' or the 'Amnesia' games, you aren't able to open more of the drawers and cupboards.  \n\nAll in all, a likable affair which is good for a cheap thrill if you're into Supernatural frights.", "recommendationid": "31801824", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520007", "timestamp_created": 1495014912, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 46, "playtime_forever": 24, "last_played": 1495025039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037077800"}, "votes_up": 12}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500321593, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Made me wanna have a boy", "recommendationid": "31801483", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505440", "timestamp_created": 1495012872, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_forever": 67, "last_played": 1495048171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138003702"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495012123, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "it is a short game, but pretty scary, worth to buy", "recommendationid": "31801356", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493668", "timestamp_created": 1495012123, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 121, "playtime_forever": 128, "last_played": 1495012018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198291670394"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496340465, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Interesting and entertaining.
