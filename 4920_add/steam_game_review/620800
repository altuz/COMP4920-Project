While there is still some room for improvment (like additional game modes) I can now feel like I just suck instead of the game not working correctly. Still a high price point for how much content there is, but it keeps feeling better every patch.\n\nOld review:\nI have been looking for a good baseball game for VR but this just wont do. I think tracking on the swings is a bit messed up, but even if it isnt and I just suck there are a good number of game breaking bugs. Not the least of which is that after a few pitches the ball will start to stand still where it should have connected with your bat, allowing you to swing again, almost guaranteeing a homerun. \n\nThe ball also likes to get stuck in the 'catchers' mitt with no hitbox but the pitcher will refuse to throw a new ball. Aside from that, it also doesnt like ending the game after a round of homerun derby is over. \n\nThe good parts about this game are the customizable options to make the game match your skill level. But the core mechanics are broken so I cant reccommend this title. \n\nFor $20+ I took a huge gamble and struck out.", "recommendationid": "31513290", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506135", "timestamp_created": 1493758479, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 69, "last_played": 1494020836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059278462"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494894235, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've put in about five hours into the game and am happy to report that this is the best VR baseball hitting simulator to date!  The inclusion of 6 different pitches adds an extra element that makes batting practice that much more realistic/enjoyable.  Don't believe me?  Set the pitcher to lefty, HOF, with nothing but fastball and slider (hello Aroldis Chapman).  \n\nThe HR derby mode is great and allows for customization.  There are definitely a few kinks to be worked out (sometimes the settings don't carry over when you reset a game), but overall this is a great product if you're looking for a baseball simulator.\n\nI would love a \"story mode\" where you go up against pre-programmed pitchers with different pitch sets and your job is to score a certain number of runs off of them.  Have them move pitches around and intentionally throw balls and strikes.  \n\nIf you don't love baseball and going to a batting cage, then this game may not be for you.  But if that's your cup of tea, you'll love this simulator!\n\nUpdate - 5/15/2017\n\nThe game as it currently stands appears to be broken/very glitchy.  When a pitch is thrown, the game doesn't register that it's been thrown and you're forced to reset the game in order to have another pitch thrown.  This is very frustrating as it's been happening more times than not right now.  It seems like it's happening when a ball is thrown and the system doesn't register that the pitch passed through the plate.

If you get the ball size down to 1.0x and juice level of 1, it's a pretty cool batting simulator. It is very difficult at first but after a while you will be rewarded with a long ball that will feel well earned. \n\nMy only critique, and this is more erogomic than having to do with the game, is the minimal weight of the Vive controller and how that effects the realism of a swing. In a year, when the vive trackers are more ubiquitous, I'm sure we will have 3rd party weighed bat handle grips that will take care of the problem, but until then this poses a hole in the gameplay.", "recommendationid": "31865986", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1495303481, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 489, "last_played": 1499361955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081159845"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
