Others have already mentioned Nuclear Throne and Risk of Rain, of which elements of both are present \u2013 Witchinour essentially affixes a ROR-styled Time/Difficulty system to the NT overhead shooter thing. It\u2019s a move providing initiative to keep the pace up, play quickly and dangerously \u2013 especially once bosses get involved and no cover exists, and your evasive maneuvering will be seriously put to the test. Death comes quickly in this game, often from a single mistake.\n\nCombat-wise, it does take a bit of getting used to the spells & specials available, especially with a relative lack of information available. Different spells and specials unlock with play so you do get a chance to gradually try everything out, but you probably won\u2019t be winning any runs until you've picked a single character & spell set and stuck with it for hours. At this point I\u2019m finding it difficult to want to branch out beyond the Sniper character with Protection & Overcharge spells, but that\u2019s also because I think it\u2019s the fastest build.\n\nLevels are randomly generated and, for the most part, this works. On occasion, you\u2019ll be dropped in the middle of a mostly-open level surrounded by enemies & projectiles from all directions, and, well, in most cases, dead. Spells and specials tend to be instantaneous, lasting for a second or two at most, and the upgrades can seem a bit muted. There is a thrill to surviving this kind of thing, but it can also be deflating to finally reach a high level and be wiped out in an instant. To this effect, I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing more of an effect from the level-up upgrades, which might potentially help balance out some of the difficulty/character imbalances.\n\nMy main criticism is that the bosses can seem unbalanced and occasionally unfair, certainly at least until one has fought them enough times. In addition, some of the earlier levels seem to appear more frequently than others, which can make learning boss and enemy patterns somewhat challenging \u2013 and that\u2019s assuming once you finally get to the boss, it doesn\u2019t decide to repeat the wrong attack multiple times in a row, depleting your MP and/or HP stocks in a second. As of this review I have beaten the game a few times and, while very satisfying, it does occasionally feel like luck factors in on some boss fights. Stages 4 & 5 (Lab and Battlemage) are especially punishing in this regard; without any cover, the machine-gun spam of wall-reflecting bullets fills the screen nearly instantly, and even with the extra invincibility frames powerup it\u2019ll chew through a full HP bar in a second. As for the earlier stages, the Dragoon and Orc levels seem noticeably more difficult than the Archery and Ruins stages \u2013 I am unsure if the level selection is random or tied to your Alert level, but the difference in difficulty between these levels seems rather marked.\n\nI would like to give an appreciative nod to the soundtrack, as I\u2019m especially fond of how it subtly integrates itself while dialing in the intensity with the progression of levels. Each level starts off with a relatively minimal theme before a new layer of music is added with the progression of each floor \u2013 it\u2019s a nice touch, deceptively cute on the earlier levels but with some filthily intense distorted bits as the game gets harder.\n\nI like Witchinour quite a bit, but I\u2019m a glutton for this kind of punishment. The difficulty will undoubtedly ward off some, though much like Nuclear Throne, as you get faster and more confident in dealing with enemies, the waves of \u201cthis is impossible\u201d gradually subside. In any case, definitely one for the \u201cI want my games difficult\u201d set \u2013 there may be \u201cfuller\u201d games of this type, but the minimalism here cuts away any loose fat and leaves what matters: fun, fast-paced action that\u2019s certainly worth the five dollars if you don\u2019t mind getting slapped around a bit.\n", "recommendationid": "34918332", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1505304846, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 292, "playtime_forever": 1094, "last_played": 1506904773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 190, "steamid": "76561198200398146"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505159894, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Very, very good game. I love dungeon crawlers, roguelikes and light bullet hells (like Enter The Gungeon, or even a bit TBOI, even if I wouldn't call that \"bullet hell\"), and believe me: I'm super picky with games. Like SUPERpicky. I browsed Steam games for DAYS (not kidding) in search of some great roguelikes/lites dungeon crawlers, and Witchinour is absolutely one of the bestest I could find! \n\nBelieve me, I have 126 games in library, I know how a good game looks like!\nLet's make the ol' good pros/cons list.\n\nPros:\n- Surprisingly pleasing graphic. I like simple, retro pixelart, but that one is just capable of creating a great atmosphere. Again, I was in art since 2009, I know how good art choices look like, even when minimalist like in this case.\n- Challenging without being exaggerate or frustrating (haven't finished the game yet)\n- Well structured, pretty content (items, outfits...)\n- Well structured, higly recognizable enemies (that's something incredibly important in this kind of game)\n- Pretty, immersive maps\n- Immersive soundtracks (during the levels the same soundtrack \"evolves\", I liked it a lot)\n- Very simple but not bland or ripetitive. This is the kind of game you play 100+ hours\n- One guy said he didn't like the monitor-lines effect. Dev made them optional. That's a good guy.\n\nCons: \n\n- Dam! I love these little cute maps, but I can't read their names! The order in which you find the levels is partially randomized, making you find one type of level or another for the second level, for example. I love it but everytime I try to read the level name, it disappears. \"Oh look, it's the Dragon ...\" it disappear. I'd love the level names to stay for a couple of seconds to read 'em, because I'm really interested in these little details, they make the game even more immersive!\n\nConclusions: don't wait for the game to be in sale, for two reasons:\n1 The game is worth 5\u20ac, word of honor.\n2 The dev needs and DESERVE your support, if you like this kind of games. We should stop letting talent to die.\nBuy Witchinour and have fun. 10/10 recommended.", "recommendationid": "34889325", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505159894, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 128, "playtime_forever": 211, "last_played": 1506760281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "steamid": "76561198146674484"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
