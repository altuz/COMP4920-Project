You can click on some staff buildings and see the employee's skills, speed, attention and charisma and how much their wage are, you can hire more employees and fire them. You can upgrade certain buildings so that they more attract the people you wish them to (e.g. you can add a bell boy to the hotel so that the VIPs are happier to stay there) . You can click on each individual visitors and see their line of thought, this will let you know of things like if your restrooms are too hard to find, if the place is dirty, if your guests would like to do some drinking while they are gambling etc. Clicking on the visitors also allows you to see what they prefer (gambling, activity, rest er whatever) and what demographic they belong to (family, tourist, high roller or else) and you can build your lot to target certain people specifically because you can't please every one (people who are looking to relax will not like a lot that has many loud buildings such as casinos and circus' that appeal to people looking for activities). \n\nThe game has the option of sandbox or campaign. You set the difficulty in the sandbox to be as you are comfortable with and it is useful for practicing in preparation for the campaign which gets pretty challenging. The campaign includes the tutorial which is a bit annoying to go through. Also, the game doesn't save automatically and you can't save before finishing each campaign chapter it seems, bit annoying. The second campaign is not a tutorial at all and has events that require actions that were not covered in the tutorial, a bit of digging and trying things out is required to win. The third campaign chapter is more challenging even and I haven't been able to win it but as I'm learning it's getting closer and closer to beating my competitor neighbour. \n\nA few things I dislike about the game: there is no undo button, when you accidentally place a staircase a square away from connected to the upper-level floor, for example, your only options to correct the mistake is to sell the staircase for regain of a percentage of what it cost to place or to leave the staircase there. This makes it so you have to be very careful where you put down things and it's kind of hard to gauge where they'll go because there is no truly visible grid inside the casino. \n\nAlso this game seems to require a lot of management: Buildings will get in very poor state of repairs if you don't tell the mechanics to go visit them, slot machines will get nonfunctional because the cashier hasn't gone to empty them and this is on top of you having to monitor each building's reputation, income generation (which you can control by choosing within a range of fees charged and, on casino games, house advantage among other things). \n\nOverall, I like the game. Quite a lot actually. It's definitely not a game everyone would like though but if you like city-builders and management-heavy games that have only okay graphics I would recommend this game.\n\nI got it on sale and I have no regrets whatsoever   7.5/10"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1403971551, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513714", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "10909859", "votes_up": 14, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198040676782", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1403933965, "num_games_owned": 870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 150}, "timestamp_updated": 1403971551, "received_for_free": false, "review": "$0.74 of Summer Sale frustration... ;)\n\nHonestly, if you're going to buy this, get it on one of the big sales.

The biggest upsides are the number of options and how much you can customize the interiors of casinos to your wishes.  You can make your casino as lush or barren as you want, make it a blackjack/craps paradise or only focus on slots.  With the largest casino, you can do both, but not every customer will like or appreciate all the gambling options.  Craps creates noise (ever been near one in Vegas?) while high rollers won't care for your low-limit slots.  \n\nThe negative/positive benefit system is actually quite rewarding and nice.  The trick is that negatives can be offset by positives, once you learn that, you won't be bothered by people complaining about smell or noise, just add fountains or something else that creates positive calm or beauty.  Those positive objects though, come at a price, including maintenance, electricity and water if appropriate, but realy once you learn how to play the game, money isn't much of an issue anymore, which is something that could be improved.\n\nLearning not to build everything is another lesson that takes time.  Your property and casino can't be everything to everyone.  High rollers want luxury and high stakes games, while degenerate gamblers want drinks and your typical family want entertainment and lower stakes.  Unfortunately, the best way to make money is to cater to the high rollers, but then that might be realistic since I haven't seen a new casino in Vegas built for penny slot players either.\n\nThe flaws of the game are in the AI and will require micromanagement to solve.  Maintenance workers won't fix buildings or objects until they break, meaning that you will have to manually direct them to actually maintain buildings and objects before that happens.  The worst part though is with the janitors who will just stand around and have to be told to specifically go to an area in order to clean the trash.  This becomes tedious and no matter what, you'll have to live with some litter on your properties and inside that lush casino you built.\n\nIn all, this game is fun and addictive, but is too easy once you figure it all out.  Plus the AI issues make it annoying at times.  Still it's easily worth $5, you'll get many hours of fun playing and building your dream casino."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1418657067, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505740", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13378642", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198052796318", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1452968063, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 680}, "timestamp_updated": 1418657067, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is like vegas version of sims :)"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1328119720, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500137", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "2722832", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011647032", "num_reviews": 482, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 7446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 243}, "timestamp_updated": 1425153901, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is a Tycoon game where you manage a bunch of casinos and amusements to make money and progress in the world.
