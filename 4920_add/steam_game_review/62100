Build rectangles out of the shapes, listen to quite well known video game songs and observe them grow with the ground you cover. It is a nice and easy concept, but boy the time mode is hectic and challenging. The six different songs are well chosen (including Portal), and the free mode without the timer is a nice relaxing experience with the right song. It's a kind of tetris that makes music! That's cool.\n\nFollow me as a curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/?appid=298050"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498630372, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507720", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32914573", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198044542588", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1463577511, "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 852}, "timestamp_updated": 1498630372, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good game that need more levels."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498270078, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500567", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32706732", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198087344093", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1504065940, "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 645}, "timestamp_updated": 1498270078, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Chime is a beautiful puzzle game that seemed to give Lumines a run for its money when I first played it. You have to place pentominoes down on a grid and create rectangles with them so the line that sweeps through in time with the music can play the sound they produce (changes depending on the shape of the rectangle) and then delete them from the board, highlighting the area that they covered. Your goal is to highlight the entire board to get a point bonus, start fresh with a clean board, and repeat the process. Each of the six songs sound wonderful and I really love both the mechanic of the music getting more [i]involved[/i] the better you do and the mechanic of different-shaped rectangles making different sounds makes each play session feel fresh, similar to Lumines.\n\n[strike]So basically, throw Lumines out the window.[/strike]\n\nSounds great, looks great, plays great, I'd recommend Chime if you're a fan of puzzle games, musical games, or a mixture of the two.\n\n[strike]No really, physically and digitally remove all of your owned copies of Lumines, Chime hecking ownsssssss.[/strike]"}]}
