Sorry couldn't resist, but seriously this game is so fun and brings something different to the table. Graphics are AAA quality and has alot of replayability. I This game is definitely flying under the radar but I'm trying to do my part and spread the word that this is a must have to add to your VR library. One thing I would like to see changed is the height of the player is taller then it should be and it's almost like I'm floating, once this is fixed this game will be almost flawless for what it is in my opinion.", "recommendationid": "34768608", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1504666872, "author": {"num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 161, "playtime_forever": 94, "last_played": 1504758442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198124516461"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 7, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
