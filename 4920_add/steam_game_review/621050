You need hundreds of gems to unlock new characters, but you can only earn an average of about two per level. That would be all right if this were actually a microtransaction-based FTP game and you could buy gems if you wanted or just play with the cheaper to unlock characters if you didn't, but in a paid game with no way to speed up the gem earning process, it's just aggravating.\n\nThere's also a really sharp difficulty curve just before Level 60 which is probably lessened if you've unlocked some different character abilities to strategize with, but I don't really feel like investing that kind of time.\n\nThe last straw for me was the game's tendency to freeze as soon as I finally got three stars on a level I'd been stuck on for a while, then not save that three star ranking after I force quit and restart, as if it was purposely mocking me.
