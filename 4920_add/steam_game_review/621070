Anyone who has played an EA will know what that means. However, this is actually in a lot better place than a lot of other EA titles I have played. There are still bugs but i have found nothing game breaking yet. Mostly, just things are not yet implemented. Don't get me wrong there are bugs and it is obvious it is EA but the team is very transparent and eagerly want to hear your opinions and I even posted a suggestion and got a pretty prompt response saying my suggestion is already in the pipeline. That screams decent dev team to me. \n\nAnyway, to the game features. Quite a lot is already implemented but there is still a lot to come. And the things that are in the game already need a lot of polish and to be built upon. Graphics range from very good to things like terrain that does need a bit of work. Guessing these things are to come. Combat is a little clunky and appears to have bit of lag between click and action (would be amazing if they did some kind of mount and blade inspired combat) but anyway you get the idea. \n\nIn conclusion as i am rambling a bit, this game holds a lot of promise. I have been looking for this type of game since northern shadow died and i bought the game and giving this a decent review due to the concept and the fact the dev team seems to deliver regular updates and are transparent. If this is something that speaks to you then get on board and help to make this game even better.", "recommendationid": "34814103", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517521", "timestamp_created": 1504875714, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 94, "playtime_forever": 313, "last_played": 1504650469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006921706"}, "votes_up": 13}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505297417, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've covered this game extensively on my channel. There are good and bad things to consider while deciding if this is a game you want to buy.\n\nThe Cons:\nIt's early access and like all early access there's no gaurantee it will ever leave early access.\nIt's an early build so there are plenty of bugs for you to discover.\nNot all features have been implemented yet.\nOptimisation is poor especially for older machines, low frame rate is a given.\n\nThe Pros\nThe game is pretty stable and rarely crashes.\nThere is a lot of content in the game.\nThe game is fun to play in it's current state.\nThe developer is very responsive to queries.\nThey're working hard to fix bugs and to add new features to the game.\n\nThe future\nStuff like the world map is apparently coming in the near future.\nThe more interesting stuff like RPG leveling, character customisation, seige eqiupment, kingdom management etc. are in the medium to long term future.\nThere's no gaurantee that any future planned content will make it into the game.\n\nTaking all this into account I think that Legends of Ellaria is worth the price at present as you'll get plenty of playtime for your money and have fun to boot. The future stuff is a gamble so if you're buying it because of what's promised I'd be careful. But if the game appeals to you in it's current state then I'd say go for it.", "recommendationid": "34916667", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512940", "timestamp_created": 1505297417, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 126, "playtime_forever": 1228, "last_played": 1506249727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "steamid": "76561198030674385"}, "votes_up": 13}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505345330, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Good concept, if development makes constant progress we may see a good sandbox game.

Only through feedback to the Devs can they iron out various bugs. I played about an hour or so and found as with all unity based games when you stop using the \"W\" key, the character still walks a few steps??? That apart the game is enjoyable. Looks like you've got to build a town, employ people to fight for you and slaughter everything in sight!
