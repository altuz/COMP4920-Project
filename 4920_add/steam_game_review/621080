The puzzles are easy, HO scenes are insignificant addition to the game and you will probably not even notice them. There is no diary, no lore,  no additional info, no bonus chapter. I can recommend it for the younger players but only if it's on sale. It is not worth the full prize. Comparing to the other HOG games it's very simplistic, both the gameplay and the story. The only reason why I am recommending it is I did enjoy playing it as a fun, short break from other games. Don't get your expectations too high, unless you are twelve. If you are looking for an intelligent, demanding puzzle solving game, this is not it. If you\u2019re looking for challenging HO game, this is not it. If you are looking for fascinating story with a twist, this is not it.

The good-natured king Badiya is mortally ill and the demonic Grand Vizier Zaved holds his subjects in an iron grip, bringing the country to the edge of ruin. To make matters worse, a shadowy disease has appeared out of nowhere, spreading across the land. A young and talented apothecary Tara decides to find the cause of this plague and prevent it from spreading further. A quest full of puzzles and challenges awaits, one that will lead her to the far reaches of kingdom and even beyond it. Luckily for her, Tara won't be alone in this endeavor. She will be assisted by a mysterious acrobat and swordsman Darius, as well as goofy but kind-hearted genie Minu. Will the 3 daredevils succeed in finding the source of an ancient evil and stop the impending doom? Join the quest and lead Tara to victory. \"\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nVery nice graphics, effects and animations. We have a few 3D character models in that game and it looks great. Cut scenes are nice but not optimized for higher resolutions as they tends to be blurry somehow.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1067870643\n\n[h1]Voices, Sounds, Music[/h1]\n\nThe voice acting is great, as well as the music. Sounds are good too.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nLike any Artifex Mundi game, the game have some common features :\n3 difficulties\nA diary for your objectives\nA map mostly used to fast travel (if you are lazy to walk)\nA hint feature\nAn inventory\nCollectibles\n\nAnd some exclusive features :\nA talking feature\nAn apothecary bag (used for crafting potions/medicines)\nShooting / Platforming parts (just click)\n\nThe game has 4 gameplay parts :\nPuzzle scenes\nHidden Objects  (HO) scenes\nItems interacting / crafting parts\nFighting magical critters\n\nFor the puzzle scenes, you will have mostly the same one as you will find in any other Artifex Mundi game : most of them are so easy to solve and some can be a bit tricky to clear.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1067851952\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1067764992\nThe HO scenes are relatively easy and several of them are nicely done. You have the regular one where you need to find items according to the text list, the one with the shadow of the objects you need to find, the one where you need to find the same object several times and the story telling one where you need to find symbols. Do not expect a lot of challenge from them as they are a few of text-list HO scenes.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1067690932\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1067744771\n\nMostly all the Ho scenes except the story one will need you to interact with the scene to find some objects. There is also one nice HO Scene where you need to find cogs with most of them rotating.\n\nThe inventory is the second key point of the game as you will acquire many objects to help you in your journey. Some can be used as is and some can be interacted or combined. One of the most interesting thing is that you can find medicine materials/items used to craft medicine with your apothecary bag.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1067735443\nYou have a few parts where you need to shoot at some spots, you just need to click when the crosshair turns to green. You have also a few platforming parts where you just need to click to go forward progressively.\n\nFinally you have a few fighting parts which you can't loose and don't have any time limit. It's a short puzzle divided in 3 short waves. In the first wave you need to find the couple of symbols you don't share with the enemy. In the second you need to reproduce the sequence shown. In the last one you need to light all the symbols, like a light the bulbs puzzle.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1067712035\n\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\n\nThey are easy and add a little challenge to the game. But like any Artifex mundi game : do not use hints and do not skip any puzzle or hidden objects scene.\n\nSeveral achievements are collectibles related, so it's highly recommended that you follow a guide if you don't want to play the game twice. Mostly because you can't backtrack areas after you've done the last task in each area. Some collectibles can be tricky to find but looks mostly the same : a Persian Palace. It behaves like a morphing item as you can only see it half of the time. In this game there is always one collectible in each area of the game so you don't really need to follow the guide.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=960359572\nAlso be sure to talk to your fellow every time you can as you may miss the talking related achievements.\n\n[h1]---------------------You want more ?---------------------[/h1]\n[h1]Steam Curator page[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/M123-GR\n\n[h1]Steam Curator Store Page[/h1]\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/29521492/\n\n[h1]Reviews Sorted by Genres[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=964304642", "recommendationid": "33586865", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504429", "timestamp_created": 1500217227, "author": {"num_reviews": 80, "num_games_owned": 2634, "playtime_forever": 151, "last_played": 1499371747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080724645"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501711603, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Terrific game. Loving the addition of a second lead character that you can interact with which is so rare in Hidden Object Games. You flip flop between the two of them throughout the bulk of the game and also dialogue options such as in classic adventure games adds extra depth and interactivity for the player. The 'Prince of Persia' theme is beautiful and the visuals are stunning. I was most pleased that, without any spoliers, there may be more games to come in this series. Please, yes :) The only fault is that some of the object manipulation tasks are a little easy and there are moments you may feel as if you are just clicking your mouse to advance the story but the story is so good that I'll be forgiving. Lastly, a few games recently have had a function whereby you are an alchemist or CSI etc and you have to pickup ingredients for a kit you have to solve a problem. By far this is the first game where thankfully this is used throughout the whole game. Most others I have played use this function for the first 20 percent of the game and then it is forgotten about in favour of the usual HIdden Object puzzles etc. . Keep doing all these things so the games feel fresh and exciting and well done for trying something different.", "recommendationid": "33980328", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1501711603, "author": {"num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 655, "playtime_forever": 208, "last_played": 1501711030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972279378"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
