But I say \"one of their first games\" because this game is as amateur as it gets.  \n\nSlow, cumbersome gameplay and a shooting mechanic that will numb your mind.  Zero collision detection between ships and random respawns off the screen leave you wondering HOW this ever got greenlit, period.  Ugh.  I scored this game in a first impressions livestream and scored this game at a 9%, taking into account it's very low price tag.
