(For its price and Indie level of course)\n\nShort:\nFirst feeling it is crossbreed of \"Door Kickers\" and \"Infested Planet\" and It is Indie Tactical Strategy \nin its nutshell as it can be... (If you like this 2 u should give a shot this one and vice versa) and some sort of mobile port?... kinda. And it is fine, for its price. But boy... gameplay... is exellent! Worth it, if You a  \"into\" real time tactical squad management strategy games of course.\n\nKinda Long:\nWe have here a Indie Strategy Game and You a Commander. You have yours Tactical Command Helicopter (Manual almost absolute FREE landings on maps with some exceptions of course), and at the same time AC-130 \"bomber\" transformer for your ground team support needs and transportation... and shit ton of loot to pick up if you like it to do, \"`case FUTURE baby\" which is COOL. You have yours ground clean up/rescue team/crew. Recruit them, Clone them, Hire them, Build them, Find them, Free them, Steal them, Sell them, Kill/Clone/Destroy/Reconstruct and force them too work for you \"`case this is apocalyptic future and U a in a DEEP NOW BABY\". Pick a mission! Equip your troops! Made a unstoppable Terminator squad armed with machete, rip of enemy rib cages, grab still beating hearts and EAT THEM (YES you CAN). And don't forget you \"DOPE\"! We fighting a dangerous infection here! Or screw that's all and watch how infection and insanity going to kill `ya loayal man.\n\nImpressive level of details and small warm features - alcohol and drug use on the job included. The graphics a simple. Sounds fine. Music.. well... (I have a tendency to turn on my own, after hour of it - Tankard on full, beer in a left hand equip+shootgun in right hand equip=have a nice day alien scum!). Voice acting minimal but with passion (ENEMY SPOTTED!!! RELOADING!!!) witch give combat more atmospheric tension feeling of sorts, also VO feedback always a nice touch. Game itself plays geat. Product received some feedback and additional developer love, with is also nice (Care=Always Good).\n\nP.S.: I'm suck at \"long stories\" (and not only) xD. But as Gamer with impressive record I can RECOMMEND this one. For its price, it is WORTH IT.\n\n(\u0420\u0423 \u043f\u043f\u0441: \u042f \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u044c\u044f\u043d, \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0445, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0437\u0431\u0441, \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0446 \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445. \u041d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u044b?^\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0443 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438^ (2017\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043a-\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a) xD. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u0446\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0448\u0430\u0448\u043b\u044b\u0447\u043a\u0430! \u0418 \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0442\u0435!)", "recommendationid": "34850006", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510945", "timestamp_created": 1505003938, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 252, "playtime_forever": 5163, "last_played": 1507138761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1838, "steamid": "76561197996889950"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505257732, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "For a little indie game Strain makes big waves. The premise is something like PROTOTYPE's Blacklight virus rolled into a dystopian semi-cyberpunk setting, with you playing the part of the humans desperately trying to keep the biohazard Strain from consuming the region. If you fail you get nuked, along with everything and everyone else in the general area. UN2 takes containment very seriously, as should you.\n\nIn order to complete your task you're given control of a small dual rotor helicopter equipped with various weapons you can use while above the area (limited by enclosed spaces and jammers) to support your small team of brave and quite suicidal panicky psychopaths in their mission to save themselves and the world. While I'm not too far in the game yet, the character types have ranged from scared scientists, who probably shouldn't be given a gun because they'll shoot their squadmates in the back, to combat androids and full on Night City Cyberpsycho SWAT types. Each has their own panic mechanism, like the aforementioned Combat Androids will terminate all infected individuals with extreme prejudice and Cyberpsychos have a tendency to go Rogue and start actively hunting down and exterminating everything they can find.\n\nAs side notes, the music is quite good as well. Infection is a serious problem and you have to be very careful in how you deal with it. While the game does allow you to revive units that have been killed, they will be permanently lost if severely infected and allowed to die from that infection. This will then spawn more Strain creatures, which can lead to a cascade of morale failures and a total breakdown of squad cohesion. Overall, amazing game for its price.

The original is below.\n\nI changed it because there is a setting to switch from the pen tool to an expandable box, there's a fix coming soon for the indirect fire, and the dev comes off as someone who is responsive and knows what he is doing. \n\nThis isn't early access, but the dev is still improving the game regardless. \n\n*****************************************************************************************************\nOriginal review: \n\nThis game is a lot like Doorkickers. At first I loved it. \n\nThen, when its controls started annoying the hell out of me, I was like, \"Why I am I playing this instead of the real Doorkickers?\". So now I'm back into Doorkickers, and here writing a negative review on Strain Tactics.\n\nThe controls are really weird. I have to assume this is a half- ass  port of an iPad game. For example, you want to select several troops that are close to each other. Instead of just dragging and selecting a box, like every other game, you manually draw a circle with a pen tool around the soldiers.\n\nThe worst offense is that it is easy to accidently set indirect fire when trying to move. \n\nHere's what makes that last thing really annoying:  When you land at your base and are just doing administrative stuff, there isn't a different 'base' screen. You have to land your helicopter and move your soldiers to different points to get things done. Your soldiers move around your own base in the same manner that they move around a combat zone. The controls are the same. So it's easy to mess up and have them start randomly blasting away with indirect fire instead of walking around. \n\nIn 4 hours of play I've lost 2 soldiers to accidental discharges on the base, whereas I've only lost 1 in combat to the actual enemy.\n\nIf they fix the controls I'll change the review. It's pretty good outside of that.", "recommendationid": "34901252", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500717", "timestamp_created": 1505223464, "author": {"num_reviews": 58, "num_games_owned": 140, "playtime_forever": 249, "last_played": 1505182799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198062265037"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505686577, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If love games with: RNG, high learning curve, prema death, last man standing syndrom, and \"oooh, i was supposed to read that text box\" giving thoughts.
