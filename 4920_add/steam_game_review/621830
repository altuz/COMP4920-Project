Went into this game VERY skeptical, but end up positively surprised.\n\nWRC 7 is surprisingly sim-like, WAY more a simulation than any past WRC titles. Actually I rate this game higher as a SIMULATION than the disappointing Dirt 4. (Well, Dirt 4 Rallycross was okay, but their \"physics upgrades\" effectively sucked the fun out of rallying)\n\nThis is close to Dirt Rally good.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n\n[b]STAGES[/b]\n\nBest stages in any Rally game, period. Detailed, narrow, full of danger and surprises. Puts Dirt 4 to shame. Think these actually surpass even Dirt Rally\n\n[b]PHYSICS[/b]\n\nActually, they are fairly realistic! More convincing than Dirt 4, who would have thought.\n\nDefinitely more sim side of things, than past WRC games. Pleasantly surprised. Only thing bothering me is the braking, the cars just stop a bit too easily. If you lock up, in real car you would get into more trouble than here. However, tyre wear is simulated and if you abuse the tyres (two compounds selectable, Soft and Hard) early on, you'll regret later.\n\nPeople saying there isn't weight transfer are clueless.. There definitely is weight transfer, and you can use brakes to load the front and rotate car around corners. Sliding feels very natural, controlling drifts feels spot on. Steering with throttle is very much possible, unlike the terrible understeery mechanics of Dirt 4. Different surfaces truly affect the car, even overheating tyres will work like you'd assume. Tarmac, snow, wet, gravel, all feel different \n\nNote also, that you can get even more oversteer with setup changes.\n\n[b]CONTENT[/b]\n\n52 stages in 13 countries that all really look and feel different. Longest one is 23 km.\n\nCars are the 2016 and 2017 WRC, WRC2 and WRC Junior cars. So no historic stuff, but to be expected. Career, Custom Championships and Online challenges should offer plenty to do.\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]\n\n[b]FORCE FEEDBACK[/b] \n\nNote that Physics and FFB are a separate thing. Physics in this game are good, car moves and behaves very much like real cars. You can see that from the visual feedback. Game can have great physics, and poor FFB. While they are connected they aren't the same thing. Good FFB doesn't exist without good physics, while good physics can very much exist without good FFB. \n\nFFB in WRC 7 is serviceable, while not mind blowing. Make sure you have Spring effects in your profiler at 100%, otherwise FFB will be dead. \n\nI'm assuming many people complaining about the FFB had their driver settings wrong, this game ABSOLUTELY needs Spring to feel right. Many sim racers have disabled or lowered it from their driver, which will feel horrible in WRC 7. It's programmed effect here (not constant Spring), and forms the core of the FFB. Damper I prefer at 0%.\n\nAlso suggest turning the \"FFB Vibration\" effect down, I didn't like this effect at all. It vibrates on engine revs, but you won't feel this through steering column in a real car. Sadly they bundled also some minor road detail into this same slider. But most of road feel remains, even if you turn this to 0%. \n\nDon't expect Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2 here. FFB communicates what the car is doing, but it's worse than the actual physics.  Feels very similar to Dirt 4. But the better physics make it feel actually better than Dirt 4. \n\nMy FFB settings: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1136158620\n[b]SOUND[/b]\n\nNo music to speak of. Cars sound okay, while not as good and detailed as Dirt Rally. Basic engine noises and backfires are fine, transmission whine, chassis flex and such things aren't there though. Sound is okay.\n\n[b]DAMAGE MODEL[/b]\n\nActually, it's pretty detailed. However, same as Dirt Rally, the cars are a bit too tough. You can keep going, when IRL you would be on a tow. Wish in \"Simulation\" difficulty, the cars would get totaled easier. You can do it, just takes a bit too much effort.\n\n[b]CO-DRIVER[/b]\n\nA bit wooden, but gives 99% right calls. Also supports multiple languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese and Japanese). \n\nI didn't have a problem about it, while it's not great. Does it's job. You can set the calls later/earlier and adjust the detail level of them. I wish it didn't tell me to \"BRAKE!\" though because it tells me that, even if I've just messed up and barely moving.\n\nEdit: Actually you can delete the braking callouts, game works and they won't be played:\n\nC:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/WRC7/WIN32/Sounds/Voice/EN/PACENOTES\n\n[b]MOTION & SIMVIBE SUPPORT?[/b]\n\nThe game seems to have native D-Box support. There is D-Box .exe in the install folder, which has loads of settings. So it clearly outputs required telemetry. \n\nBut at the moment SimVibe is not supported, if it ever will be is a mystery. For me SimVibe is pretty important for immersion. Hopefully they can add support, but don't think past WRC games have one.\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n\n[b]NO TRUE TRIPLE SCREEN SUPPORT & NO VR[/b]\n\nTriples image is stretched, while otherwise works fine. So, just like in Dirt games. There is also weird zoom-in effect, based on speed. It's not as terrible as might sound because it's quite subtle. Just something I'd like to disable. \n\nMotion blur (not a fan) seems to be forced on at first. But actually, you can disable it by disabling Vignetting. Makes sense? No, but works.\n\nWRC 6 had experimental VR support they showed in conventions and such. Didn't make it to full release. And this one still doesn't have VR, sadly. A developer said on Steam forums, they don't have plans for adding it.\n\n[b]LIMITED FOV / SEAT POSITION SETTINGS[/b]\n\nYou can't adjust the seat height. Which is too high for Triple Screen users. Also getting the camera close enough isn't possible either, even with \"Very close\" dashcam setting. I ended up using the bonnet cam. Which I wouldn't normally do, just works better here. Hope they could patch this issue.\n\n[b]PERIPHERALS ISSUES[/b]\n\nGame's understanding of multiple input devices is bit of a mess. \n\nThere is a function called \"Axis detection\" which is supposed to recognize unsupported & multiple peripherals. But currently it's not working. However, you can get separate pedals working by assigning them as buttons. For some weird reason, they will still work as Axis in the game. This is very confusing, and needs patching ASAP. \n\nWas able to get TH8A working as a handbrake by this method. Seen also footage of people driving with high end pedals and wheels, with separate USB connectors. However, I've heard some having trouble getting a G29 to work in the game. T500RS worked out of the box. \n\nSuggest testing with your peripherals. Steam refund works flawlessly, used it many times. \n\n[b]USES DENUVO[/b]\n\nSo, there's that. \n\nThe performance is fairly okay though. Able to run triple screens 60 fps with 980ti, by dropping from Very High to High and dropping Post Processing SSAO to medium.\n\n[h1]STUTTERING ISSUE FIX[/h1]\n\nRun as Windowed, then press Alt+Enter to go into fullscreen. I do this once per play session, zero stutters. But if I don't yeah.. there is stutters. Obviously needs an official fix ASAP. \n\nAlso, use in-game V-Sync. Yes V-Sync is not ideal as it creates some input lag, but it's only way to get smooth experience at the moment, at least for me. I use \"V-Sync (A mode)\".\n\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\n\nPleasant surprise, went in with zero expectations, finger already on the refund button. But what do you know, best rally game of 2017. If you enjoyed Dirt Rally, you might like this.\n\nDon't expect it have the best FFB in the world, but if you're thinking this is another arcade crap WRC release, you're seriously mistaken. \n\nAlso, judging by WRC 6 update history, obvious issues will be patched: http://store.steampowered.com/news/?appids=458770\n\n[h1]8/10, recommended.[/h1]", "recommendationid": "34987376", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609043", "timestamp_created": 1505535680, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 2155, "last_played": 1507171499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 728, "steamid": "76561198278429557"}, "votes_up": 78}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506050774, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Like many other simracing fans I'm surprised at the mixed reviews.  This game is a huge step ahead of its predecessors.  Physics are intuitive, stages are absolutely amazing, and after some tweaking of the wheel I found it more immersive than any other rally game out there.  This truly wonderful game deserves VR and an analog hand break.  If we got these two things I wouldn't be able to stop playing.  \n\nIn terms of specific car physics, I can only compare it to the real life.  If you have only driven the Fiesta in this game as the Junior WRC entry, then you might be sceptical as to how you can trash it around so hard while the car maintains so much grip and feels sort of like a rear wheel drive car.  I own the same gen Fiesta, and with summer tires, rear sway bar, and front and rear strut bars, my car feels exactly like that.  And I can't imagine the upgrades the rally car goes through to make it what it is.  I also own a heavily modded WRX track car, and I have to say that the nimbleness and accuracy of my Fiesta with limited mods over my WRX with fully upgraded suspension and far better and wider tires still boggles my mind.\n\nI own a fanatac v2 wheel and my graphics card is a 1080, and with everything maxed out I had no issues that people are speaking of.  The stages truly are a work of art! Not only how they look, but even how many surfaces change over a stage, and for example, how a patch of ice can feel different from one area to the next.  I also love the attention to small details like tracking of each tire on the gravel and snow surfaces, how twigs break and shatter after you have hit them, the sparks from hitting a guardrail, and how the interaction with each of these objects effects the car in a way that I would expect it to in real life.  It's too bad the replays right now can't show off these amazing stages in the right way.\n  \nEven still, I believe this is the best rally game out there today.  I say game, because it's not quite a simulation, but pretty darn close to it.  It crushes Dirt 4 in every aspect except graphics clarity, which can be a bit of a turnoff, I have to admit.  That motion blur really has to go you guys!  I can't stress enough how important it is for the graphics to be crystal clear in a driving game.  The game has plenty of sense of speed, and does not need anything to enhance it.  It's better than Dirt Rally for sure, unless you play with the RFPE mod.  RBR is only better in terms of the damage and setup.  The physics in RBR are really not relevant anymore, no matter what people say, and I do still love the game.  Assetto is still king in terms of physics for tarmac rallies (especially if you have a motion rig), and stage mods by Simtraxx and others are amazing!  This reminds me, Sim Commander software absolutely needs to support this latest WRC title now.  \n\nWRC 7 really captures the essence of current rallying, which the developer did a masterful job of.  The speed of the cars also feels right.  The time and control it takes to execute a hairpin feel perfect to me, but you have to really get the game and wheel settings right.  With that in mind, it's not about how fast you are going through a stage, but just the enjoyment of driving and getting the technique right, which naturally results in fast stage times anyways. \n\nKeep in mind, my review is solely based on playing the game in simulation mode.  So, for those casual arcade racers, sorry you had to waste 30 seconds of your life readying above writing.  I have no idea if you would like this game.  \n\nAnd lastly, although I fully understand the financial reasons of creating the game that reaches a broad audience, it's too bad this can't be an out and out simulation game, because it's clear that the team really has the talent and the ability to make that happen. I was really disappointed in the last WRC title, but now I'm back being a fan again in a big way.

The answer is yes.\n\nIt's brilliant. It is not, however, Richard Burns Rally 2, nor is it DiRT Rally 2. If you're looking for a \"more realistic\" experience after putting 1,000 or so hours into DiRT Rally, this might not be the solution. The realism or believability of the handling varies from surface to surface. \n\nIn Rally d'Italia Sardegna, it feels almost like you're playing RBR. The car is ludicrously skatey and floaty, but in a fun, satisfying way that is easily controlled using your throttle and brake. Moments like this are where the game really shines, handling-wise. It's responsive and lively like DiRT Rally, but slippy and elegant like RBR.\n\nIn Rally Finland, the car feels like the tires were manufactured by Gorilla Glue. I don't just mean that you have a lot of grip (you do). I mean the cars tires, through my G27, literally felt sticky. It's a strange and not-so-true-to-life experience. Sometimes you'll find yourself going flat-out around bends that would have killed you in DiRT Rally or RBR (or real life), planted firmly to the ground without a bit of lateral motion. Other times, you'll suddenly frisbee off the side of the stage and cut down more trees than the Finnish Forestry Commission. It can be inconsistent.\n\nBesides the variable handling in terms of expected grip, as a player, the handling was almost immediately intuitive and comfortable after bingeing on DiRT Rally while the game downloaded. DiRT 4 felt confusing and alien - it took me several hours to even gain the ability to hold a line or a drift angle, and even then never for long, or to my satisfaction. The cars in D4 practically begged to understeer into an outside spin at some times, and refused to move the rear out a single degree at others. In WRC 7, the cars love kicking their tails out. All it takes is a solid flick (or tap of the handbrake) and a feathering of the throttle, and the cars take an angle and - more importantly - HOLD that angle so long as you keep it steady. They'll turn in or out at your behest, or hold fast and drift like crazy if you tell them to.\n\nThat's the main thing for me. Even if the game is - on average - less realistic than DR, which was never an incredibly realistic game to begin with, the cars are intuitive and they behave. The rear does what you want, and you rarely feel confused or frustrated by the car making its own decisions in terms of angle or balance.\n\nPROS:\n+Stage design/stages from actual WRC events\n+Career mode\n+Sometimes handling\n+Multi-surface stages\n+Fun and intuitive, to contrast with D4's incomprehensible feel\n\nMEHS:\n~Performance\n~Lack of FOV options\n~Wheel compatibility issues (my G27 worked fine but there are tons of reports of issues here)\n~Sometimes handling\n~Graphics (vary from solid to ridiculously dated on a moment-to-moment basis)\n\nCONS:\n-Overall, less \"realistic\" than RBR or DiRT Rally in most handling cases\n-Co-driver is robotic and kinda shit, but I didn't mind so much in terms of playability\n-Sometimes handling\n-Lack of car variety\n-Controls are wonky without tweaking, no clutch(?) and handbrake does unexpected things to the car", "recommendationid": "35338159", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519627", "timestamp_created": 1506779468, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 181, "playtime_forever": 345, "last_played": 1507085765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 345, "steamid": "76561198022149774"}, "votes_up": 16}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505485488, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 12, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 2, "review": "The tracks are fantasic.

The stages blow me away although they aren't acute to real life the are amazing the flow of them is great darting between each corner it is very satisfying. The current game needs a bit of work with the wheel setup but I found no problem with setting up my T500 RS it just worked for me maybe I was lucky in construction it is a great rally game with good physics and great stages I would recommend to any fan of rally but it still doesn't come close to Richards burns rally\n", "recommendationid": "35101711", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503045", "timestamp_created": 1505990697, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 604, "last_played": 1506467320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 165, "steamid": "76561198109205839"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506706268, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Giving a big thumbs up on this one. Only in my JWRC career so far but what an improvement over the previous two releases by this developer. Their first attempt WRC 5 was truly godawful, the second WRC 6 was a dramatic improvement but still lots of gamebreaking moments like driving at night and in bad weather the graphics didn't stand up. I am delighted to say that third time is the charm. There are still minor flaws but this is a GREAT game at a GREAT price. Having said that is it Dirt Rally no, and it doesn't try to be. However, what it is is a very rewarding romp through the WRC calendar and season. If that is what you are looking for then do not hesitate to buy it. If you want a sim experience that will test your wheels and all the gadgetry you have for this sort of game then yes you will probably be disappointed. However, if like me and I am sure many others, who often only have 30 mins in between work and family to just pick up a controller and go, then this is SERIOUS bang for your buck. It even plays smooth as butter on my laptop with a GTX 960m, even though I know some higher end rigs had stuttering issues, but I had none and it does seem the developers are working hard to iron out the very few bugs that are there. Give them credit, they are a small studio trying hard and doing a remarkably good job. If WRC 7 is this good I can only imagine what WRC 8 will be like. 10/10 and a MUST buy for any casual rally gaming fan!!!", "recommendationid": "35305993", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506706268, "author": {"num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 247, "playtime_forever": 254, "last_played": 1506732760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 238, "steamid": "76561198014649631"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506744995, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is simply a superb genre defining WRC Rally experience with two unforgettable endings.
