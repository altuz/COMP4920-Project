If this is the type of game your interested in, it might suit your gameplay style to have it on a mobile device rather than a PC. It runs smoothly and does not feel awkward with keyboard controls, but playing on a keyboard compared to a touch screen does mean it is easier on the PC.\n\nThe game is 90 levels long and it took me less than an hour to complete the first 30 stages. The stage difficulty did not seem to ramp until I hit stage 30 as well, so if my gameplay stays at the same rate then there would be about 3 hours of single player gameplay here. For an independent title I believe a dollar an hour is fair value, so I do feel that it is a bit overpriced at $3.99 and that a $2.99 price point would be more fitting.\n\nEach stage is made up of a variety of traps or monsters, that needed to be navigated through to reach keys. Once all the keys on a stage have been collected the exit opens up and you can go there to progress to the next maze. Every 3 or so mazes you are given the chance to save a princess of varying \"quality\". The princesses will reward you with gold, cosmetic items or new traps types to put in your own maze. Before you can cash in though, you need to wait until the princess wakes up with the higher loot princesses taking longer to wake. \n\nThe game is an enjoyable time-waster and provided it can get enough people to play, it has a fair amount of replayability. This comes in the form of player created mazes. To be able to attempt other peoples mazes, you need to begin by creating your own. The harder the maze, the higher your reward for beating it. If someone beats your maze, their winnings are taken from your gold. So there is a balance there in that if your maze is easy, people will get a lower reward - but if its hard then there is a chance they wont beat it at all.\n\nI have recommended this game, even though I feel it is overpriced for the length of the single player component. Hopefully the player created mazes can flourish, allowing this game to overcome this limitation by providing reason to come back after the campaign is done.", "recommendationid": "33344199", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510605", "timestamp_created": 1499437568, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 1116, "last_played": 1504090269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960286303"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499421431, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "addictive as hell", "recommendationid": "33338182", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478312", "timestamp_created": 1499421431, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 44, "last_played": 1502694064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198297937469"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
