Destination unknown, maybe as far as possible away from earth.\nIt is a pity the game doesn't tell us what happened to the protagonist after she left.Maybe there will be a second chapter?and why this time the AI wasn't the evil? Too many questions without answers.\nRecommend to the folks who love sci-fi and got too tired of Outlast-like games.", "recommendationid": "35494579", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1507208220, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_forever": 501, "last_played": 1507205800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 501, "steamid": "76561198237622686"}, "votes_up": 0}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "No user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 0, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
