(Obviously)\nOne thing i would like for the devs to change is how as an animal, if you die you can just play as one of the other animals, i dont like this because you cant play alone with a friend. If the animal dies, he/she can just switch to another animal, and it'll be game over for the human. 1v1's is not possible in this, basically humans have to be atleast 3 people until its fair.\n\nOne thing i would not want for this game is for it to be like Who's Your Daddy, and by that i mean where they ''overupdate'' it to where its impossible for the dad to win, because you have a pet running around pooping, and a pool outside, and batteries in a shelf, and soap in a bathroom etc... Because it would be a shame if they ruined the game like that, it has alot of potential.\n\nBut from what it seems like, i think they may just stop updating it and just leave it. If this you're reading this a month or more after this review and there hasnt been an update, dont buy the game, its probably left to rotten.\nIf it has been updated though then buy it for sure.\nThough i would recommend buying another copy or a friend or making him buy the game himself, as it is more fun with friends.\n\nPro's\n- Every animal has a unique ability, which makes it very fun\n- Theres lots of fun items to use as the human\n- The Kangaroo has an amazing sound effect.\n- The ragdoll physics are very nice, though there are many glitches at its current state of development\nCon's\n- Ragdoll physics as i said, are fun but glitchy.\n- The game doesnt explain much, or at least i didnt really understand anything at first. Like how to open the gate with the key, i know theres a button that needs the key, but i dont know how to use the key on it, which it doesnt explain either.\n- If an animal dies, and there are animals which have not been picked by other players, the animal which died can take over that animal and live on, which is the worst thing about the game in my opinion.\n- The bald eagle, is very OP at its current state.\n\n(Sorry for bad grammar throughout the whole review.)\nAnyways, there isnt much more to be said, its overall a good game, but if you're planning on getting it, make a friend get it too.", "recommendationid": "33703363", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507278", "timestamp_created": 1500663703, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 187, "playtime_forever": 137, "last_played": 1501523945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017812855"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500797470, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Oi mate", "recommendationid": "33738910", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505710", "timestamp_created": 1500797470, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 825, "playtime_forever": 64, "last_played": 1502001117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198118704931"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503763137, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've had the game for some time now and it's been months since the last content update.
