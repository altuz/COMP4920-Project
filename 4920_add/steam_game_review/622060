Because this is probably one of the funniest otome games i've ever played. Now, I haven't finished playing, but I have to say there hasn't been dull moment yet. All of the characters are unique ,and special in their very own way, and their differences make for great comedic moments. That also goes for mc, whose confidence knows no bounds, she is absolutely hilarious because of it, and very likable too. I'm a fan of confident mc's you see, especially this one, whom seems to be a little delusional in the fact that she believes all the boys want her , and heck she may very well be right, but if she isn't you can't convince her otherwise. And I love her because of that, and honestly you will too, because she is real good fun. There is not a negative thing I can say,  I am really liking this game. \n\nI'm playing Jeremy right now ,and so far , while he doesn't show his like for mc in a straight forward manner. You can tell he likes her by the simple fact that he tries in his interactions with her, which you learn is quite difficult for some of the guys in the unfriendables. An example would be like when they are on a date , the little germaphobe makes a compromise to hold mc's hand so long as she washes them very well.  I personally find that to be very charming, and hilarious. Especially when you see how much of a downer he is, did I mention he likes Disco music. An oddly upbeat genre for someone as pessimistic as he, but it makes him all the more charming.\n\nIt's honestly a very unique ,enjoyable game, and I haven't even played the full extent of it. And ,they even offer a free version , where you can play three of the guy's route for free, so honestly why not give it a go. I feel it is 100% worth it, everyone needs a laugh ,and great quirky characters in their life.", "recommendationid": "34698989", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517084", "timestamp_created": 1504399264, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 4195, "last_played": 1506764055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1083, "steamid": "76561198375996021"}, "votes_up": 9}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
