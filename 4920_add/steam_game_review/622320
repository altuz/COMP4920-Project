There's very little effort involved in finding the key to the door / elevator or whatever it's supposed to be to the next level. There are so many ammo and health drops there is absolutely no challenge to the game. Other than a couple of doors in the way (that aren't even locked) it's pretty much a straight shot to the end of the map. So far I've encountered two enemies: a soldier type that stands and fires and if they get close enough to you occasionally a glitch happens where they cannot inflict damage, and a robot that fires a bit faster and has more health. Both enemies do so little damage it hardly justifies the 20 or so health items in a map, and both enemies die so quickly it certainly doesn't justify the 50 or so magazines worth of ammo you can find in each tiny map. From starting the game, the splash screen itself made it feel cheap as it literally looks like a very poorly compressed .jpeg image circa 2000 from MS Paint. The music doesn't seem appropriate to the game, a bit over the top metal that doesn't really fit the whole look and feel. I have also experienced a glitch where I can see between the seams of walls into other rooms. This game feels rushed, and it's way too easy with there's virtually no challenge at all. It's as if it was pushed out in a couple of weekends specifically to make some quick cash.", "recommendationid": "31961131", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523543", "timestamp_created": 1495752027, "author": {"num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 653, "playtime_forever": 6, "last_played": 1495751697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983660276"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497286646, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its a good game but here's the thing I don't know the objective.
