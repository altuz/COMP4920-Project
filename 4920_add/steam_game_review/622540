And it is well put together espically being the first product that the devs have made. Here is the bugs and glitches I have found in this short time playing. And also my ideas for future improvment.\n\n1. Inside of the big plane compartment there is no sound walking inside of it. And also the plane has invisble barriers due to I guess static mesh of the planes skeleton.\n\n2. Once you find a small area with a house with a chimmeny in it you get stuck if you go through the small door and your upper body somewhat goes into the top floor.\n\n3. If taken by the Npc(Enemy) In this game and put into a locked room with the only way getting on is by jumping onto  the second floor above if you end up doing so and dobule jumping or hitting a ceartain spot on the wall while trying to get up and over it puts you on top of the house.\n\n4.If you find a gated area with a tracter and a water tower at the back right there is a spot where you can jump off onto the gate and get stuck on it and then the game displays a message under your feet about something.\n\n5. If you find a tunnel with a wall asking you break it, well if turn and face back towards the way u came, you go to the right and between two trees there is a rock you can walk through.\n\n\nThese are the suggestions to improving the game.\n\n1. Mabye a better intergrated inventory system of being able to see the items while on the selected item and even adding animation of eating or drinking the item. \n\n2. Mabye more different types of birds please, the other ones are somewhat annoying lol.\n\n3. Adding stamina to the hud and the character.\n\n4. Add a more scary feel by having the Npc walking around looking for you and mabye have more than a couple of them.\n\n5. Add if you go for a swim or get wet your temp drops faster.\n\nThis is all I have so far and will contiune to give feedback. Great game and has high potential just don't abandon it like most devs do.", "recommendationid": "32768617", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515703", "timestamp_created": 1498391405, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 111, "last_played": 1498392933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198281802402"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498965424, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 20, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Terrible game.", "recommendationid": "33112367", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449411", "timestamp_created": 1498965424, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1498886343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198286247050"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
