Game settings are set on low and when I changed them I was teleported to a different level. The settings remained on low. After killing a few guys the game exited to windows menu. The annoying rock music also loops constantly.\n\nThe game is not representative at all of the videos. This game should be free or under one 1$ even that is pushing it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aTQxmQ-HqmM?t=7s", "recommendationid": "35283226", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498856", "timestamp_created": 1506662897, "author": {"num_reviews": 143, "num_games_owned": 1621, "playtime_forever": 23, "last_played": 1506807130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "steamid": "76561197970420888"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506926129, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A great start for Sombrero way.
