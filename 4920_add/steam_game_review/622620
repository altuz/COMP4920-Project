I felt I was absolutly more interested in the story of the game, than many of the puzzles. There was also alot to read, so I'll guess I kinda got impatient (for a really patient guy normally).\n\nBecause of the lack of achievements (I am happy for that this time), it was simpler to just push the hint button frequently or skip a puzzle, just to see the story....I tend to want to know how I solve a puzzle though, but a few of the minigames in this game I couldn't understand. So frustrating.\n\nIn the end. I like that there was a good story, many fun puzzles, and a few horror elements.\n\nI'm gonna end it here with something weird. Whenever I started the game or alt tabbed, the game had to reload every single time. It didn't take a second, but almost half a minute each time, and that is really strange for a point and click game. The first game in this serie took only one second. I'll guess computer power doesn't mean a thing for this game.\n\nRecommend buying these two \"Nightmare adventure\" games in a bundle. If I am not wrong there will come more games in this serie, so watch out that too.", "recommendationid": "33394438", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505218", "timestamp_created": 1499577154, "author": {"num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_forever": 436, "last_played": 1499576871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197968073802"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
