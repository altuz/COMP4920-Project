You walk around, interact with objects, occasionally jump and swing around a weapon, and that was ok. We loved BATIM for the story and the mystery surrounding Henry and the inked demon himself, Bendy, and though the chapters were short, they were packed with excitement and most importantly, questions. More and more questions that needed to be answered. It was undoubtedly this collection of continually growing unanswered questions that generated the popularity that Bendy has enjoyed since its debut. \n\nWith this standard set, it comes as no surprise that I went into chapter 3 expecting more of the same. I wanted mystery, I wanted story, I wanted questions. Did I get any of those things? Absolutely not. What I did get however, which I found to be extremely obnoxious was the blatantly obvious attempt that the developer had made to stretch out what otherwise would have been a 15 minute experience, to 90 minutes by adding the most boring and mundane fetch and retrieve tasks .. not once, but SIX times back to back. I literally had to find and deliver 4 of the same item a total of SIX times, after which the game was over with basically nothing having happened at all during the entire chapter.\n\nTo me, this was a lazy and unimaginative attempt by the developer to push out another chapter priced at $6, which was actually a 10 to 15 minute experience, padded out to 90 minutes with completely inane and mind-numbingly boring fetch tasks that contributed nothing to the story whatsoever.\n\nI'm all about supporting small developers, but not like this. This was a very, very poor attempt.", "recommendationid": "35292329", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505807", "timestamp_created": 1506689044, "author": {"num_reviews": 34, "num_games_owned": 919, "playtime_forever": 105, "last_played": 1507028747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 105, "steamid": "76561197993302934"}, "votes_up": 12}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506792783, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Chapter 3 was everything I was expecting and better!

More mystery, questions, confusion? Hardly!\n\nThe pacing of the first 3rd of Chapter 3 was justified, it felt exactly what I expected, with a few extra additions (hiding boxes, clocking in points/save point?) it help my attention well. \n\nHowever the middle 3rd of the chapter is where the game fell flat on its arse! I felt like I was transported back to the early days of World of Warcraft, this isn\u2019t at all what BATIM should be. \n\nThe Item task really crossed the line for me when I was asked to destroy the Bendy cardboard cut outs, out of all the requests from Alice THIS was absolutely ridiculous. Collecting the Ink and other Items made sense to her dialogue, but the cut outs come across as a desperate last effort to squeeze an extra 15 minutes out of the player, considering the whole grab & fetch mission was largely the majority of the game; shameful tactics from a lack of imagination of the developers. \n\nThis review comes after 1.5+ of game time, to which I have sat back and reflected on what I really experienced.\n\nVery happy to stop my patreon donations to The Meatly as this isn\u2019t what I felt the first few chapters envisioned.\n\n", "recommendationid": "35296786", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500190", "timestamp_created": 1506694236, "author": {"num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 404, "playtime_forever": 154, "last_played": 1506720711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "steamid": "76561197980494152"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506887184, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is an amazing game!
