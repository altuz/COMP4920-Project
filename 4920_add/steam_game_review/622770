We've enjoyed the game so far but beware this is early access. We really enjoy these stealth style games and to see a good co-op implementation.  Since it is early access I am giving it a positive review because I see a lot of great potential but, there are definitely bugs. Also there is a not a lot of content so far. Hopefully more levels will be added the replayability is moderate.\n\nSome bugs I've noticed:\n\n1)The friends list does not allow you to connect to the same game so we chance it and queue up at the same time. Luckily, we have always been put into the same lobby.\n\n2) the guards sometimes glitch and never start their patrol routes\n\n3) If you change roles in a lobby you cannot use role specific abilities that you acquire through leveling up/completion rewards.\n\n4) It seems to use a lot of system resources for a not that graphics intensive game. My girlfriend\u2019s laptop drops frames and lags everywhere despite her laptop being able to handle many other games. Specifically in the stealth agent role. \n", "recommendationid": "33354188", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1499461422, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_forever": 430, "last_played": 1499621128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197965622411"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504520772, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Can't play online AT ALL. request refunds for both me and my friend.\n\nYou can play the single player just fine, but it is boring and just clunky. \n\nIf you try to play with someone online, ANY one, online you simply disconnect. \n\nIt's been months now, no solution or patch to the online game, still unplayable. just another game I regret buying, and I bought two copies!\n\nThe developer did offer my two free copies rather than a refund!?
