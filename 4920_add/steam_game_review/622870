The most misleading thing for me was the description regarding how to do the stealh kill. When it says \"0_Block\" they mean your block/guard-buttom.\n\n-Some of the optional mission objectives are a bit too hard, I think.\n\n-The bowmen are a bit too challenging, they really have an amazing aim. \nI mean can't they also miss their arrows sometime? Like when you haven't practiced your shuriken skills, your shuriken will miss the target sometimes (just go dead past the enemy guards). You start with 68% hit-rate or so... can't those bowmen be nerfed to at least 70% hit-rate, because they have some daamn accurate arrows! :)", "recommendationid": "33329390", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505041", "timestamp_created": 1499390181, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 312, "last_played": 1499396198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018430564"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 14, "total_positive": 14, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
