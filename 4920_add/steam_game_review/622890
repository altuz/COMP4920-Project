Ingame Settings menu includes only options to mute either the sound or music (no sliders) and reset your game data. \n\n[b]Controls:[/b] You move the worm in cardinal directions with either WASD, arrow keys or numpad, whichever suits you best. [b]Worm moves only forwards and only when you move it,[/b] so take as much time as you want to think your next move. Worm cannot cross itself (this becomes an issue as it grows longer and longer) nor can it retreat and if it gets stuck, you fail the level.\n\n[b]Levels and gameplay:[/b] There's total of 120 mazelike levels and you have to beat the previous one to unlock the next. In every level your objective is to eat ALL the skulls, brains and/or eyeballs to finish the level. There's a timer ticking up on the upper right corner, but it affects only how much blue skulls (i.e. score) you will get when you complete the level. Maximum being 3 blue skulls per level. As far as I know, you can't fail the level because you took too long.\n\nAs you progress through the levels, game introduces some new mechanics. So far I've only seen locked doors that require specific keys, pressure plates that lowers cages holding munchies and stuff and worm holes which basically let you \"teleport\" to another location on the level. There's probably lot more, but I'm currently stuck at level 23.\n\nFor those of you, who are into this kind of logic/puzzle games, where you don't have a constant time pressure to finish the level and who like somewhat halloweeny cartoony aesthetics in their games (or at least don't find them off-putting), I do recommend [i]Omnom Necropolis.[/i]\n\nedit.
