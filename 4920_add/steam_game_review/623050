Being a dancer, standing on the center of the stage is an immersive experience. The feeling of punching the rhythm is pretty great. After played awhile and be familiar with this game, I found the system of this game is interesting. Every time I punch the rhythm, I got the score based on my performance, it is not difficult to get a \u201cPERFECT\u201d. When I got enough hits, the visual effect became very awesome, I felt fulfilled.\n\nAdvantages:\ngood feedback\nHas multiple difficulty levels\nExcellent\u00a0graphics\n\nDisadvantages:\nOnly few music can be chosen\nFrame drop\n\nThe price is reasonable, not high. And The graphics\u00a0are nice\u00a0and\u00a0well\u00a0presented. Highly recommend this game.", "recommendationid": "35323225", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506720", "timestamp_created": 1506747301, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_forever": 122, "last_played": 1506747115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122, "steamid": "76561198220511641"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
