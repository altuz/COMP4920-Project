I like the game. It's fun, it does all of the current Delicious things (upgrade products, level special goals, cheesy but sweet storyline). My first impression was negative just in the dramatic change in character design. It is pretty obvious that the team behind Fabulous Angela made this game because all of the characters I've grown to know and love over the last decade look like completely different people and all make that same silly OOPS face that started with Angela. I mean every character makes it, it almost every scene. It's overkill. But that's really nitpicking. Beyond some bizarre story aspects it really is a fun Delicious game and the music is great. I'm actually really disappointed the sountrack isn't available because this is one I would buy in a heartbeat. They're definitely upping their game in graphic and sound quality. That said the game is still really buggy. I mean really buggy. It is playable but it crashes constantly. Sometimes just randomly which is frustrating but always when I try to alt/tab out of the game for a sec. If you minimize the game it crashes no matter what. Playing in windowed mode does fix this, but it just makes the screen too small for me. My only last complaint is that you cannot get 100% achievements on Steam because it doens't recognize Steam friends as playing. I like to get my 100%s and this irks me a little. Overall if you're a fan of the series and it's counterparts you'll enjoy this game, but be preparred for a bit of annoyance. \n\nMy suugestion to the Gamehouse folks: Stop rushing these games to marklet. I get it the fans scream and yell and freak out whenever a release date slips by BUT they'll calm down when the final product is good and not rushed. I'd rather have fewer games in year, but better quality and possibly longer, than frequent buggy or mobile only games.", "recommendationid": "34353458", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517544", "timestamp_created": 1503158684, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 203, "playtime_forever": 1022, "last_played": 1503274540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046602387"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502743014, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "English isn't very good. I tried my best stating facts clearly.\nI saw this game on  youtube and bought it. I have now finished it 98% (and cant complete it sadly)\n\nPositive:\n* Cute story, a bit more superficial than Hopes and Fears, but I enjoyed it\n* improved/change cute spirtes, you get the feeling that they really grew older\n* good mix of challenges and levels\n* fair difficulty, I had to replay some levels to get 3 stars (combos are more important)\n* random generated challenges for extra diamonds.\n\nNeutral:\n* It looks like its designed for mobile phones. The menu is now on the bottom of the screen and you cant see how many points you need for 3 stars. I don't like it, but thats only personal preference.\n* there are some typos, but I guess they will be patched out sooner or later.\n\nNegative:\n* The achievements\n1. Its almost impossible to get all of them. \"have 5 friends own this game\" really? Thats trying to boost sales, not an achievement. I have NEVER seen this kind of achievement and I hope I will NEVER see again.\n2. \"unlock all furniture\" sounds nice BUT I finished the game and 3 or 4 challenges. I'm still missing 94 diamonds. Even IF I could get 3 diamonds per day (which isnt possible everytime imo) it would still cost me 32 days. If you only get 2 diamonds every now and then its more like 40 days. One or two weeks would be more realistic. I like playing this game, but thats way to much time spend. (replaying challenges doesnt earn additional diamonds)\n\nConclusion: I liked playing this game and I recommend it. Its fun and took me about 16h to complete it. If you likes the other Emily games, this is a good purchase. If you are a new player, it's fun aswell. But the achievements ruin it sadly.\n\nEDIT (14.08.2017): As I read on steam the friends achievement isnt even availible(bugged) for PC/Mac users and requires facebook connection. Gamehouse is making things worse. I'm editing this if any fix/news are released.\n\" have forwarded this to our team and they will be reviewing this trophy/achievement! I am sorry for any inconvenience and hope they are able to come up with a solution soon\" gamehouse (09.08.2017)", "recommendationid": "34242967", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501005", "timestamp_created": 1502742703, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 99, "playtime_forever": 977, "last_played": 1502740785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039094489"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503615967, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is, unfortunately, my least favorite of the Emily games.
