Sprites for the main character Hoshino Yumemi are now sharper and clearer with hardly any grainy textures, the game's achievements now have nice background pictures or portraits of Hoshino instead of a single picture across all achievements and the game has trading cards now.\n\nGame is still as beautiful and unforgettable as the earlier non-HD version. I would nominate this game for the same I'm not crying, there's something in my eye award if there is another similar Steam nomination event this year for 2017. On the minus side, given that the game only has Chinese interface and subtitles at the moment and the game has a 20% discount at the time of this review, even for those who have owned the non-HD version and the game doesn't seem to be available in any bundle offer yet, the price of this kinetic visual novel might be a bit high as it takes less than 10 hours to read through the entire visual novel, unlock all CGs and background music and get all achievements.\n\nOverall, this game is recommended for those who are able to read Chinese (or at some point later in the future when Visual Arts and Key release additional language support in future updates as announced in their Twitter page), for Visual Arts and Key or Planetarian fans who are interested in collecting the game or the game's trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile backgrounds or for those who want an easy kinetic visual novel to get all achievements. My review for the non-HD version of Planetarian is below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006413390/recommended/316720/", "recommendationid": "31743349", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570592", "timestamp_created": 1494752738, "author": {"num_reviews": 91, "num_games_owned": 2216, "playtime_forever": 165, "last_played": 1497438546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006413390"}, "votes_up": 36}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495463464, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The 3-5 hour story takes place in a post-apocalyptic future and is told from the perspective of an unnamed Junker \u2014 a salvager who searches cities abandoned by war and plagued by perpetual acid rain for any trash that could be redeemed as treasure. The eerie silence of his seemingly eventless trip to the war-torn site of an abandoned planetarium is broken by the cheerful voice of a young woman greeting him as the 2,500,000th visitor. What is another person doing here? This doesn't feel right at all. So, with a grenade launcher cocked and loaded, he encounters Yumemi Hoshino \u2014 a chatty robot employee of the planetarium who's miraculously still functional but \"a few fries short of a Happy Meal.\" At first, Yumemi's overly friendly nature and almost saccharine optimism annoy the Junker to no end, but her effervescence eventually grows on him.\n\nUnlike many visual novels, which read like Choose Your Own Adventure books with branching pathways, Planetarian reads like a straight up \"light novel\" (Japanese novels with illustrations- somewhere between a manga and a full-on novel). Basically, all you do in this \"game\" is read words, look at the pretty pictures of anime characters atop dreary environments, and listen to the voices and background music. There are no choices to make, no branching pathways to explore, and only one ending. Speaking of light novels and voices, Planetarian spawned a light novel featuring four short stories and some audio drama CDs, so the storyline extends beyond the main game. \n\nMusic and voices are the only reasons to have Planetarian in a game format vs a print format. The evocative soundtrack has some lovely music, and my favorite pieces exhibit a shimmery quality. As far as the voices go, Yumemi's voice is suitably vibrant and Junker's voice is suitably disparaging. \n\nPlanetarian is not a bad game, but it does not tug the heartstrings quite like Freebird Games' To The Moon or hit the emotional notes of Key's other games like Kanon, Air, or Clannad. Planetarian's story is all too brief, and the game's interactivity is nonexistent. I would only recommend it to the most ardent fans of Key, and even then I would say to wait for Clannad's localization instead.\n\nPros:\n+Enjoyable story.\n+Soothing Soundtrack\n+Good CG artwork\n\nCons\n-No gameplay.\n-One Ending with no branching route to select\n-Only Chinese Language for this HD remake\n\n-MY THOUGHT-\nThere's something truly memorizing about the idea of a post apocalyptic world. Perhaps its the perpetual loneliness of a race on the brink of extinction or how survivors struggle to cope with reality by clinging onto past memories. Whatever the case, Planetarian embodies my favorite scenario in anime by telling a tragic tale between the most unlikely of companions in a world that has left them behind. \n\nThe story revolves around a hard nosed militaristic man and an adorable AI unit named Yumemi who functions as a tour guide of a Planetarium . She has zero awareness of the world on the verge of collapse around her, and is simply happy to have her first visitor in over thirty years. These two could not be anymore different as entities, but together they find brief solace as the only inhabitants in what may be the last peaceful refuge on the planet. \n\n\nConclusion:\nPlanetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~ is a visual novel that fans of the genre should be required to play if they missed out on it previously. Once you know what you\u2019re getting into with kinetic novels, it\u2019s easier to simply sit back and let the storyline work its magic. Once the game is over it\u2019ll stick with you, too, which is still a surprisingly rare and impressive experience to get with games.", "recommendationid": "31901856", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544586", "timestamp_created": 1495463464, "author": {"num_reviews": 164, "num_games_owned": 1989, "playtime_forever": 384, "last_played": 1495462701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198276383313"}, "votes_up": 23}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494321927, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "When I saw the Chinese version of Planetarian in Steam store, I purchased it without hesitation.
