I never played this back in the day, so I have no nostalgia factor here.\n\nPROS:\n - Reminds me of the Motorstorm days\n - Some of the best car - environment physics interactions I've seen in a game\n - Wide variety of vehicles\n - Upgrading system that isn't too detailed, but is detailed enough to be interesting\n - Tuning and upgrading that has a meaningful effect on car handling (different people will have preferences, there is no 'best' tuning setup)\n - Complex parts damage simulation, from the radiator to the oil pan\n - Can call a helicopter to come repair you on long-distance races\n - AI that makes mistakes in a believable manner\n - HD texture work adds a ton of atmosphere\n - Three hour long race across all the maps in the game combined\n - Have to fight with the car to keep it on track (if you're used to road racing like I am, you have to re-learn how to appraise corners and jumps)\n - Local split screen, online multiplayer\n - Cheatcodes, because fun is more important than achievements\n - Can shove small buggies around when driving a big truck\n\nCONS:\n - Mediocre visual damage model (no dirt/mud on car, no denting)\n - Some of the worst car - car physics interactions I've seen in a game (if you bump into another car, you can get locked into drifting TOWARDS the other car until you clip through it) [EDIT: This happened to me lot more with the first two vehicle classes than it does the later ones]\n - Terrible sound mixing (volume of car engine is insanely loud when in hoodcam)\n - Very dated music\n - Awful keyboard control mapping (once you remap the controls so that you can play the game, navigating the menus is a nightmare)\n - Strange, jarring holdovers from arcade racing (for example, when you cut a corner, you don't get docked time like you do in real life - you get reset onto the track)\n - AI can get so obsessed with its own racing line that it absolutely refuses to overtake you, and just bumps you up the butt until you crash\n - This is probably the biggest one for me: You cannot damage your car to the point where it stops working. 200km/h into a tree? Whoops, flat tire.\n\nThis game is, essentially, a more grounded Motorstorm 1 with far better environmental interactions, and far worse car to car contact. It's really growing on me, but you have to be a specific sort of person to find the diamond in the rough. Get it on sale for USD$20 or less. Or maybe $23, like it is at the time of this review.\n\nEDIT: Here's a couple of things I've found. 1) The '160 vehicles' thing is bullshit. The game counts each different vehicle paintjob as a vehicle. There's still a nice variety of vehicles, though. 2) It only gets more fun the further in you progress. If you're like me, and you just want to race without the stress of needing to come first to progress the career, just input 'SHOWTIME' into the top right of the configuration tool. Bam!

Sort of a thinking man's racer.\n\nIt's main draw from other racers is the almost openworld nature of the circuits and tracks, circuits spanning 2-4 miles. The average circuit race has your multiple lap head-to-head. 5-8 minute rallies. And my favorite, the 1-4 hour Baja races.\nNormally that would sound dreadful. But it features a wear&tear damage system. You have to manage how you drive throughout a race.\n\nBrake too much and you might wear them out before the end of the race. Clutch kick too often and eventually lose acceleration power.\nDrive too aggressively with powerslides, high RPM, and lots of jumps and bumps, and your suspension, tires, and engine can each be victim. All the types progressively worsening the performance of your car in different ways. Forcing you to stop to use your limited spare wheels, or call in a chopper for system repairs.\nBut, if you have a preferred driving style, you spend your credits on upgrading the parts most affected by the style, and fine tuning the various parts of the vehicle.\n\n\nSteering wheels are supported, but force feedback is lacking even constant resistance, making it really hard to steer. It's very much designed around a controller, and shouldn't be played without one.\n\nWatch out for this one in sales. It's current 30\u20ac tag is way too high for anyone but those who immediately know they're in the niche for it.\n\nI should also add that this isn't a great PC port feature-wise. It uses a custom launcher to set all the PC specific settings, and it has at least at launch had issues working. But once the actual game starts I've noticed no issues.

Wheel setup is hit and miss at best at the moment. If it becomes apparent that the game isn't supported I'll change my review.\n\nGreat physics and tense racing, all the good fun of the original seems to be intact, plus the bump in FPS from the 360 really makes a ton of difference in dynamics and just how lively the racing feels and I cannot wait to tear up some silt in online games, which I could never really do on the consoles.\n\nOne thing I discovered is that you really have to launch it from steam to use the launcher, otherwise you won't get to configure anything at all. Yes, I still put shortcuts on my desktop and enjoy using them, provided they don't bypass crucial content like video options and controls....\n\nAlso the config I input in the launcher doesn't seem to save.\n\nSearching for a multiplayer game is like firing a flare down a blackhole but that's alright that's how it was in the original. Would've been nice to have just a list of games available and filter to taste but that list would've probably been empty anyways. Steam will make it easier to organize some games, and if the modding community is strong, then this remake could become something very interesting.\n\nRegarding multiplayer, a big disappointment is that online Rally and Baja races and limited to 6 slots, while you can have 16 players in circuit races. Even if that's how the original was (never could find enough players to do long races but still) this should've been improved. I don't see a good reason for this limit apart from stragglers and trolls preventing the end of stages but even then we can kick them. People who take part in 3 hour races don't fuck around when it's time to manage the playing field.\n\nOverall 7/10. Unless you already know you want it, wait for a sale. It's still the great game it was but man oh man I hope they kick it into a higher gear with simple features and don't resort to fixing a few bugs and ghosting.\n\nModding this one could go a long way, but I'd be surprised if modders can edit stuff like how many players can join a baja 1000.

I acknowledge it's lackluster racing wheel support and thanks to previous reviewers' \"head's up\" I was not at all surprised when my old MS FFB Sidewinder wheel wasn't recognised during controller set up. Howevever, the controller I used (XBox gamepad) worked flawlessly. In fact, I would say the lack of racing wheel support is now a non-issue for Baja:EoC...I don't believe I said that...especially since I HATE the lack of fine control in steering when I use a gamepad. I was able to weave through opponents with precision. Very surprising. Gameplay is exciting and realistic...the AI opponents have a temper and I don't get away with much during a heated race. Multiplayer (split screen) worked without an issue. The black line (bug?) cutting off your upper field of view when in cockpit, as mentioned by another reviewer, is still there, but I switched to another view without an issue. If it's a bug, they need to fix it. Graphics are clean and crisp, framerate with a GTX970 hovers around 120fps with all the bells and whistles on \"high\". Sound is great and allows me to hear when an opponent is catching up and on what side of me he is on.\nOverall, as a fan of Mickey Thompson(R) and his spectacular off-road events, I would say, \"Drop whatever you are doing and buy it\".\nParting thoughts: Baja:EoC is the best off-roading game I have played. Controller (or lack of) support is a non-issue; and believe me, I would have returned it, if I couldn't control it. Any off-roader worth his/her salt will enjoy it. You can play it on one PC with friends. AI is smart, but they believe in \"an eye for an eye\". No crashes in 17.4 hours on my PC.\n\nEDIT: With over 30 hours in this game, I feel I must double-down on my review after a whole lot of races (solo). This game really satisfies my off-road racing bug, with the majority of races won and lost by a margin of mere \"feet\" (or meters). My opponents definitely have a temper and will use the track to their advantage. Is the bug regarding the partial black screen gone? I haven't noticed it for a few days, now. My only complaint would be, when changing views from external to the cockpit (driver 1st person), the sound of the engine is way louder than from the outside view...either raise the sound externally or bring the cockpit noise down a wee bit. That's the only thing I can think of...not a deal breaker, at all. The driveable area is mind-boggling...I can drive to points far into the horizon...kudos to all that were involved in creating this game. Thank you.\nIn closing...I'll say it again...any off-road enthusiast worth his or her salt needs to experience this game. You can always return it, but I bet you won't after a few races. Take a trophy truck out for a test drive...listen to the engine and watch it eat up the road/track/trail.", "recommendationid": "35046987", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511821", "timestamp_created": 1505747035, "author": {"num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 595, "playtime_forever": 3098, "last_played": 1507188807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1666, "steamid": "76561197970538156"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505434859, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a solid game, with absolutely no clutter.

This game is very fun and way more fun that buggy racing in the Dirt series. There is a good amount of varied tracks and terrain. Its best to play in Simulation mode and it can be hard to keep your vehicle on the track. Plenty of vehicles to choose from. There is variety of things that can get damaged and you can toggle a view of the gauges for those on the side of the screen. The hill climbs are brutal and fun.  \n\nThe negatives would be; Some cars in cockpit view (where you are basically looking over the bonnet) have a roof that flex and bob right in your view and is very annoying. Not all cars are like this in this view mode. But they need to address this because it ruins the fun, however at least you can switch to just the view with your rpm gauge etc on the screen when its like this. \n\nSometimes loading the game the controller is not detected and you have to quit and reload the game again to detect it.\nThe VO for an overview of a race series or mode is on the quiet side. \n\nThe long races are broken up into 20-30min stages, would prefer just one long race. I guess the plus is if you get too far behind in the next stage everyone starts together again. \n\nSo in conclusion graphics wise it feels a little dated, but the gameplay is very good and very fun.

Will need to give the wheel a spin.\n\nThe various buggies feel like they have a decent weight, and playing on simulation physics with full damage is great fun. Definitely the only way to play: put up the realism settings and cater the AI to your needs, and have at it. Don't expect RBR/DR level of physics here, but it feels decent all the same.\n\nTracks are great. Expansive, variable, ready to bite you in the rear end at a moments notice. You'll need to have a care if you're playing as \"real\" as possible, engine management and limiting/negating damage as much as possible will be key to making decent headway. Don't expect to be able to \"learn\" these tracks, unless you have a damn GPS system in your head.\n\nSure there a couple of bugs that need fixing, and maybe some tweaks to be made (keeping your default/preferred view would be a nice one), but for that Motorstorm like feel, on huge tracks, with damage management and decent enough driving physics that put some \"simulations\" to shame (looking at you, Dirt 4), Baja nails it.\n\nWhack up the realism, start up one of the 3-4 hour races, and enjoy the chaos.
