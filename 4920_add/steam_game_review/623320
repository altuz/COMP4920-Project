It has challenging platforming and puzzles, but it's also fun to screw around and kill each other. If you are looking for a fun couch game to play with your partner or friend, I definitely recommend it. The game is still on Early Access, so only half the game exists. I can't wait to play the rest. \n\nFurthermore, the art style is cute and retro. \nThe music in fun and funky. The game mechanics work very well.\n\nSome levels are a lot easier than others, but there are plenty of levels that will give you some trouble and keep you on your toes.", "recommendationid": "33916306", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513900", "timestamp_created": 1501456795, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 286, "playtime_forever": 270, "last_played": 1501455752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072543073"}, "votes_up": 10}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
