The concept sounded pretty cool. Keep in mind this game is Early Acess and it certainly looks and feels like it(in my opinion). Perhaps I didn't have the settings right, but I believe there isn't sound in the game yet. The style of the game is pretty nice. \n\nThe concept, one player being a big gorilla monster while other non VR players attempt to attack or flee from him, is really cool. It just needs to be fleshed out more. I think adding larger maps would do wonders for this game. Also having the environment a little bit harder to destroy would be good. \n\nThe gorilla being able to pick up anything to smash the opposing players with is a little OP.\nAlso, in regards to the maps, having them be more dense and lively would be great. I think this would add to the immersion of the game as well as make it a bit more challenging for the VR player(in a fun way!) Have some other cars driving around as well as people. Add some more detail to the ground as well such as trees, city benches, light posts, etc. \n\nMy friends who played against me as the tanks and fighters told me that the game, at the moment, seems a bit unfair for them. They said the controls were also a bit awkward. I also think that perhaps shrinking the size of the vehicles and making them faster or more manuverable would greatly help. Adding other cars just driving around would also help this. Perhaps, more AI controlled military vehicles would help as well.\n\nI'm sure the devs have a lot of their own plans already, so I'll stop here.\n\nThe game is definitely still rough around the edges, but I'm happy to support it and I hope the devs will continue to build upon what they've already created here. This game has A LOT of potential and I can't wait to see what the future will hold for it.\n\n", "recommendationid": "33685827", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "timestamp_created": 1500600715, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 246, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1502527800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990597269"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499975095, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this game is great pick it up ASAP!

If you have multiple kids who love VR but can't play many of the games due to content/multiplayer then this may be your game.   Now given it's in it's early stages it doesn't feel complete but I have not run into any major bugs.  In my opinion at it's core, is a solid, fun, game idea that I hope gets future updates.\n\nThe graphics are in a basic polygon style and it runs smooth on a GTX 980 with no problems for any players.  The game play for the PC players take me back to N64 days in terms of graphics and controlling the tanks/planes  (I mean this in a fun way).  \n\nBeing the Gorilla is, of coarse, the most fun.  You get to pick up your opponents and hurl them into the sea, throw buildings at planes, eat people... all very entertaining when you can all hear each other.  As for the VR locomotion the controls have a grab and pull type mechanic. At first it felt odd but after 10 minuites it was easy to use and can definitly be used without roomscale.\n\nRight now it has three basic game modes and some experimental modes but they mostly invovle either attacking or hiding from the Gorilla.  Respectivly the Gorilla needs to survive or find objects/people.\n\nAgain, if you have kids that have trouble waiting for their turn in VR this is a must buy for $10.", "recommendationid": "33561521", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507317", "timestamp_created": 1500131264, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 35, "playtime_forever": 624, "last_played": 1505499272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051392539"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500240476, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One of my favorite VR games.
