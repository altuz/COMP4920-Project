I like the fact that there is some gravity for once in a ball/racquet game with predictable trajectory.\n\nPros:\n-nice graphic and ambience, sound effects\n-level variety (but not enough?)\n-love when I hit multi ball, way to clean a level fast\n-slow motion is a nice touch, you have to really think twice beofre using it as it is a limited resource\n-got me scared of hitting my walls :) good thing you see your solid game area\n-realisitc bounces, predictable (unless you hit the anti-gravity tile !)\n-no hit misses so far\n-power up adds variety\n-replayability (I want to beat my score)\n\nCons:\n-UI a bit confusing: took me a while to realize I have to stay on the button to press them, to try out a level you have to use the training button, new will start a level 1 (for score consistency I presume?)\n-Hard difficulty is way too hard, ball bounces way too crazy. Moderate was fun though (but hard)\n-I would love to have more than 10 different levels, even though after I completed all 10, it started over at 1 with the brick needed to be hit twice\n-no global score leaderboard? I want to compare my score with the entire world :) !\n-more power up please :) !\n\nOverall a nice little game, very addictive and got me sweating.

It is a nice casual game easy to play but tough to master. The power ups add a lot of fun, and it is highly replayable since they are randomly generated, always a new challenge. The physics is good enough to make me actually feel I am there. The ball responds well to how strong you hit it and rebounds are accurate.\nThe price seems reasonable since the game is constantly updated and new content has already been announced.\nOverall a nice little indie game!\n", "recommendationid": "31320946", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1492956843, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1492958223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066166624"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493344478, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "PingBall VR is fun, easy to pick up action game for VR !

The physics seem way off from what I expected.  Most of the return balls come back right at your feet or so close to your body that a racquet isn't appropriate. A shield would be a better option. The balls require too light of a touch. Hitting them hard, like a racquet is made for, will make them return near light speed. In this case, again, a shield would be a better option. The premise is a great one and could be extremely fun if the physics worked better. The playfield may need to be bigger to be able to hit the ball harder and give the player more time to react. Holoball is a great example.\nWith some playablility changes, this would be an awesome game!", "recommendationid": "32708454", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1498273965, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 51, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1505079032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032652093"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1492301402, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Entertaining and challenging Racketball-breakout style VR game! Nice graphics, great background music and immersive gameplay with roomscale support and good physics. Check my first-impression VR gameplay of Pingball in Mixed Reality view:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo45rXktLFI&t=50s\nI guess the video gameplay says it all, but to sum it up, I really enjoyed playing PingBall! Its very good looking graphic-wise, with great sounds and lovely relaxing music in the background. The ball physics feels surprisingly realistic, and the racket-handling with the Vive controllers is spot on! For the price, its well worth to try out - and if the developers add more levels soon (which they surely will), Im sure most of you could enjoy this VR experience for hours and have fun! PingBall is also a very nice show-off game for people to try out VR for the first times, as its immersive and entertaining with perfect roomscale-gameplay.\n\nThe good parts:\n+ Graphics are great, sharp and colorful\n+ Sounds and music is awesome, especially the background music!\n+ Slow motion and other power-ups is a cool idea - especially multiball!\n+ Physics and ball handling feel realistic, no glitches or issues whatsoever!\n+ Solid racket handling and control system overall\n+ No problems playing in small play space area (2.5x2m) \n+ Levels are different from eachother, good variation\n+ 3 levels of difficulty, and even Easy mode is quite challenging!\n+ Mixed Reality (unity engine support) is working great and looks cool!\n\nThe less good parts:\n- Couldnt find much, except that I want to see more levels, more power ups, more content in future updates! And hopefully some multiplayer mode and online score board as well :)\n", "recommendationid": "31167432", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494210", "timestamp_created": 1492301402, "author": {"num_reviews": 70, "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_forever": 60, "last_played": 1496329740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198164837178"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
