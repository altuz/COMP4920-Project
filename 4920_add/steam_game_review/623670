I think the same can be said for people who play Moe Mekuri. That is not to say Moe Mekuri is Dark Souls hard, just that both seem like games someone plays to punish themselves rather than to have fun.\n\nMoe Mekuri SP is an anime-themed puzzle game, based loosely on Lights Out. Your goal is to turn all tiles on the board face down to reveal a picture of an anime girl, which is then added to your gallery. Higher difficulties of the same level show the girl in more revealing outfits. The game has its origins on the Xbox Live Indie Game store, where there are three (or four, depending on your count) versions of the game: Moe Mekuri, Moe Mekuri 2 (and 2.5), and Moe Mekuri 3. I personally only own the last game in the series, so take my words with whatever amount of salt you feel is appropriate.\n\nMoe Mekuri SP collects the puzzles (and artwork) from the previous games in one package, along with the soundtrack for the games. That being said, if you own the previous titles on Xbox there is not much to see here. In fact, this feels like a bit of a lazy port; there are no settings of any kind. You cannot change the volume, or the resolution, or play the game in full screen. Despite its origins as an Xbox Live title, there is no controller support. There are also no achievements, which is true of the originals as well, but it feels like it would not have taken much effort to add them for the Steam release.\n\nAs one would expect from a direct port, all the annoyances of the original are still present. The difficulty curve is all over the place. There is no rhyme or reason to which puzzles will be hard to solve; puzzles on easy are often harder than those on higher difficulty levels, and later puzzles are often easier than earlier ones. There is no hint system, or way to bypass a puzzle; if you cannot solve a puzzle, you cannot proceed and are simply stuck. You also cannot play the higher difficulty of any puzzle until you have completed all puzzles on the earlier difficulty levels.\n\nI completed all puzzles on Moe Mekuri 3 on all difficulty levels, but even I found myself frequently unable to proceed, sometimes for weeks at a time. Unless you are some kind of puzzle God, a lot of the time it will just become a game of pressing everything and praying something works.\n\nThe artwork is fine, but nothing horribly interesting. There is nothing lewd to see here. Even by simple fan service standards, this game is pretty tame. Music is a variety of upbeat songs with Japanese vocals. Some of the songs are pretty good, while others are forgettable.\n\nConsidering Moe Mekuri SP is three game's worth of content rolled into one, and it has the soundtrack, you might want to pick it up if you are really into puzzles, or really, really into anime girls. Otherwise give the game a pass, there are better puzzle and anime games on Steam.", "recommendationid": "31325173", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558395", "timestamp_created": 1492969833, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 209, "last_played": 1493308291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198257403401"}, "votes_up": 30}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502144244, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Well, what seemed like forever for more XBLIG titles to hit Steam now and days is surprising, but normal at least. (Kinda like MBG with his games, as an example.)\n\nBut anyways, what I didn't expect to see was Moe Mekuri to arrive on Steam so suddenly. Although, its roots go back to its original release in 2011 (Man, 6 long years, huh, lol.), where the game lets you flip panels to see the girl(s) clearly. Flip all of the panels in each stage to progress to the next one and so on, and add more girls to the gallery. Although the gameplay is simple enough, it gets harder later on without the use of a guide. (Unless you want to do so if you're stuck, lol.)\n\nAnyways, the SP version of Moe Mekuri brings the characters from all 3 M.M. games in 1, but uses M.M. 1's mechanics, not 2/2.5, which seems a little different with its ball flip mechanic. But I suppose its easier that way for the originals' mechanics. The game, which have been updated recently to play any track from M.M. Sound Collection at the start, and the option of text in either English/Japanese. (Though Lyrics and CD Info stay JP text however.)\n\nIf you decide to get this and try clearing them on all difficulties [Easy/Normal/Hard], you'll earn various outfit changes from all 35 girls, though that varies on the differences of the characters (and yes, fanservice too). Closing off, this gets my recommendation if you need a break from w/e and play a puzzle with panels to flip.\n\nKohei's other works, such as Maid-San's Caving Adventure, and The Houchi Play, are now on steam.", "recommendationid": "31554785", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "timestamp_created": 1493971326, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 76, "playtime_forever": 581, "last_played": 1501568563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075816695"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1493978452, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A very cute and erotic puzzle game brought to you by a japanese developer.", "recommendationid": "31539403", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500499", "timestamp_created": 1493896440, "author": {"num_reviews": 265, "num_games_owned": 433, "playtime_forever": 162, "last_played": 1493905320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160868511"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
