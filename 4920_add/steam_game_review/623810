It's basically an interactive story, and it's lovely. I love the art style and it hits the cuteness quotient.  The visual level variety and portrayal of emotions is exceptional.The snow level is what it feels like to be lost.  The rain level is what it feels like to be sad.  And so on.  My first playthrough was about 80 minutes.  I stuck around to find all the carrrots and see the secret level and it took me a little under 3 hours to get 100% achievements. There are elements of a walking simulator here, but that is broken up by a couple of minigames and a couple quizzes (which are endearingly mistranslated as riddles).  There are a few tiny grammatical errors  here, but I'm thankful to have an English version of such a wonderful game.  The simplistic walking controls weren't always as smooth as I would have liked, but it wasn't much of an issue until the carrot trial.  I can easily recommend this game, but I think the better price point is around $5, so watch for a sale.  [spoiler] I was a little disappointed the secret level didn't progress the story any further.  I was hoping Doggy would come after him.... {/spoiler]", "recommendationid": "35215607", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506400014, "author": {"num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 4881, "playtime_forever": 174, "last_played": 1506398894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 174, "steamid": "76561198039619705"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506723768, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I really enjoyed the game and truly felt what the little rabbit is feeling. It's cute, but also very deep and somehow depressing as it deals with loneliness and abandonment.\nBUT: I'm a bit frustrated after I finished playing because the ending is very sudden and it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Also I bought it on sale and I guess I wouldn't have payed the full price.\n\nSo, I would recommend it if you want to play a short little game with cute graphics and a deep story which might leave you a bit sad.\n\n", "recommendationid": "35314406", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506723768, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 78, "last_played": 1506722715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78, "steamid": "76561198218102639"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
