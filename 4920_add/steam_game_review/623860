As a former handball player and coach i was looking forward to a game like this. BUT....\nIve just finished season 1. and when I started season 2 the game crashed every 2 minutes. When i finally played a game after 10 restarts the result was 0-0. I tried to play 1 more game season 2.  Same results. 0-0.  All results in my league was 0-0.\nThe translation is somewhat bad. Some words are in english and some in german.\nMy goalie suddenly was put outfield when i tried automatic team setup. And an outfield player was set as goalie. Ok, some goalies are decent outfield players, but not after the age of 14.....\nThe layout is a mess. Untidy and difficult to get the hang on. Ive played alot of manager games and this is by far the most untidy layout.\nSeems to me that the developers was in a hurry to release the game. And it doesnt seem they know much about handball. \nThe game engine didnt seem to bad even though its better to use a goalie as an outfiled player than to choose an outfield player in the wrong position. I tried to set up the team \"my way\" and even if the \"rating\" was better the result was always worse. Let the computer choose the team setup.\nSadly I cant recommend this game.\nHopefully it will come alot of updates. I wont give up on the game.\n", "recommendationid": "31927603", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511451", "timestamp_created": 1495592412, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_forever": 464, "last_played": 1500921821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041334550"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500478789, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Ok, now the game it's playable and funny again :)\nI'm not being payed: simply enough, the developers listen to the community!\nIt took a month, but the problem is now solved and I can, finally, continue my career with Kothen!\nI really hope to see more products and maybe some other stuff for this game!\n\n\\---/\n\nOk, just forget everything I written before.\n\nWhy? There is a bug in the game that prevent to play more than one season!\nYes, you have understan correctly: the game fails to load any game saved after season one!\n\nA fraud! Nothing else to say, as the developers don't answer or check the forum anymore...\n\n\\---/\n\nWell, this game was quite a surprise.\nI frankly expected the latest \"cheap\" sport/management sim (you know, terribly buggy, not tested, frustrating as... I think you could make an idea).\nI love this type of games, and, from my reviews, you can see HOW many simply failed to being a decent product because, well, often they simply... don't work; too buggy!\n\nThis game is simple, probably (surely) with an outdated graphic compartment, but... it works!\nI'm not an expert of handball, but I could play this with a little expertise and... without bugs!\n\nSo, I know this product doesn't seems so appealing at first, but I think it can be interesting, for genre fans.\n\nHowever, my congratulations to developers: at last, a sim game that works!
