It\u2019s a decent game, with potential, but some distance to go. If you want a finished product wait a bit longer and check out the game again further down the line. I can only recommend this game to people willing to accept a pretty barebones product to casually race around in and maybe unlock a few cars to be ahead when the game nears it full release state, and accept the risk that that day may not come. If I could give a sideways thumb I would, but I\u2019ll give the game a recommend, especially since it is clearly listed as an early access game, but only for people that view the game in the light that I mentioned above.\n\nMore on the game:\n\n==Graphics==\n\nBoth the cars and surrounding look nice. I can play at ultra graphics and still get good performance with an i5-3470 and RX 480.\n\n==Handling and controls==\n\nThis game is definitely 100% arcade, so if you are more into sim racing, I can\u2019t recommend this.\n\nOn the keyboard, handling feels fine and not too sensitive, cornering does feel like it has some \u201cweight\u201d to it and a bit of braking may be required when taking sharper corners. I find the driving experience with a keyboard in WoS acceptable for an arcade game. \n\nWith my Xbox 360 controller for windows (wireless), the experience in less enjoyable, through some sharper corners you can keep the throttle down and just shove the joystick in the direction of the corner, this makes taking 90 degree corners feel more like throwing the car in a direction than steering it and ultimately the cars feel weightless at times. On straights, the cars feel a bit twitchy and move around a lot even with the smallest joystick inputs and I find myself having to correct it often. \n\n==Maps and Tracks==\n\nThe game currently contains the following tracks: Street circuits from Moscow and San Francisco, there are a few different tracks per city available with reverse versions available for some of the tracks in practise mode. Racing tracks, only Nordschleife (as a full track or broken up into 3 parts) is currently available. Countryside/Highway type tracks: Azure Coast and California Highway are the two available tracks at the moment. They are also available in their full configuration or broken up into 3 stages.\n\nCurrently the only way to drive on a track of your choice is through practice mode where you can select and drive on any of the available sprint and circuit tracks, you can do 1-9 laps on the circuit tracks in the practice game mode. For MP racing you cannot select a track to race on.\n\n==Customisation==\n\nPerformance: Very little can be done here to differentiate your car\u2019s performance from others, everything is just unlocked and bought which gradually improves the performance of the car. There is no tuning or building a car to perform better in certain aspects available. The only choices to be made are based on tyres, where you select which type you wish to race with before each race. The 4 tyre types are: stock, drift, street, track. The latter 3 have to be unlocked separately for every car before you can choose to use them in a race. \n\nVisual: Bonnet, Boot, Skirt, Rims, Front Bumper and Color are customisable items. About half of the paint colours are available from the beginning, the rest of the paint colours and items have to be unlocked first. Obtaining items requires dealer points for the specific class to unlock it and credits to purchase and install it. One nice thing though is that once an item has been unlocked and bought you do not have to re-purchase it if you change over to and back from another paint or part. Visual parts do not seem to have an impact on performance.\n\nOnly the Subaru BRZ, Ford Mustang GT and BMW M3 E30 (the 3 Early Access DLC cars) have a single permanent livery each available at the moment, there aren\u2019t liveries for any of the other cars (credit and diamond purchased), and are listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d for them.\n\nNone of the customisations are behind a paywall or random rewards from races so maxing out a car or getting it to look how you want it to only requires credits and dealer points, which are both earned from racing.  \n\n==Social and Playerbase==\n\nThis is the area that I\u2019m the most negative about. At times this feels like a single player game with a multiplayer gamemode rather than a racing mmo. \n\nAt this point the game lacks the ability to add friends, invite them to private races (which don\u2019t exist) or queue for MP races together in a group.  Text chat is only available right before and right after the race and only with others in the race. I feel that a large part of what will make this game successful is a good implementation of social aspects \u2013 making friends, racing together and chatting with people \u2013 and a crew/club system. The game is just not ready for people who want to start a new crew or multi-game crews/clubs to branch over here at the moment.\n\nThe majority of the races I\u2019ve done had at least one AI player in with quite a few being against just bots. I only found out that this game was finally out when I checked in on the old website and was directed to steam, something has to be done to inform people who signed up to play this game long ago and all but forgot about it as time went on as more people are clearly needed to fill lobbies at the moment.\n\nThis game seriously needs a social hub to meet up and hang out with other people to create some much needed atmosphere, whether this is at the airfield playground that was announced and talked about when the game was announced or somewhere else. \n\n==Currency==\n\nCredits: Credits are received by participating in races or converting them from diamonds (1 diamond = 50 credits) The amount of credits earned in a race can be boosted by placing a bet on finishing a certain place or higher as well as meeting some other criteria (overtaking, slipstreaming, drifting, top speed) at the start of every race. There are 3 tiers (easy, medium, hard) the pay-in is greater, but so is the pay-out for higher tier bets. Credits are used to place bets as well as buy cars, upgrades and visual parts after unlocking them. Credits are also used to repair vehicles as their state decreases after racing. \n\nDiamonds: Diamonds can be purchased with actual cash or received when buying DLC. Diamonds can be used to purchase premium cars (1 per tier from C to G), converted to credits or used in the process of transferring dealer points from one tier to another\n\nDealer Points: Dealer points are earned from racing. A tier \u201cA\u201d car will receive tier \u201cA\u201d dealer points and so forth. These points are used to unlock cars, upgrade kit stages and visual parts before they can be purchased. Dealer points can be transferred between tiers at a cost of 1 diamond per 10 DP transferred.\n\nXP: Not a currency but fits the best here. XP is needed to level up and levels in turn unlock higher tiers of cars that you can start unlocking and buying.\n\n==Cars==\n\nThe cars in the game are split off into tiers from A to I. Tiers are unlocked as you level up. Premium cars \u2013 whether DLC or special diamond cars \u2013 can be bought and used before you reach the required level to unlock the regular credits purchased cars from the same tier.\n\nPremium cars grant an extra 50% XP, cash and dealer points at the end of each race when used.\n\nSo far it seems that a credits only path through all available tiers is viable which will bode well for competitiveness when/if a f2p post-beta launch happens.", "recommendationid": "34776019", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1504706251, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 27, "playtime_forever": 1082, "last_played": 1507099755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198053388918"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505716174, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Good game overall, need to open it up so we can play online with friends.
