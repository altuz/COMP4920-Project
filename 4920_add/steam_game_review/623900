I appreciate the sense of detail with which the game was created.\nGUI could be more polished and there are still minor deficiencies in AI's behavior, but so far the game is in the Early Access stage and already now it is fully playable without any hitches or game crashes.\n\nThe price is very low and the game is worth it.\nTaking into account that this is the first project of a single developer, I can not say otherwise than: [b]Nice job man!
