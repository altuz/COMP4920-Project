The game is easy and addictive, the story is really interesting and well formed.\n\nPuzzles are very difficult, at least one game where the player is supposed to be smart! One thing that has happened to me is that you feel identified with the protagonist from the beginning and you like it. I am a male player, but being a female character has not displeased me or felt strange to me.\n\nThe graphics are acceptable, even on some levels they are very good, as in the bridge or in the engine room.\nIn general a game more than acceptable, with a good script and an adequate gameplay.

Further into the game and the puzzles will be challenging, but fun nonetheless! I can't wait to get back into the game and see what other puzzles are in the game!\n\nFor those who are curious on how difficult some puzzles will be (or to those who are struggling with the puzzles and curious on how to solve them), here's another gameplay video of mine (once it is done uploading). https://youtu.be/iWRziLGgyuU\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLess than an hour into the game:\n-Puzzles are straightforward and not that hard (which is good)\n-Camera was a bit hard to control with the mouse (luckily you can adjust sensitivity)\n-Better voice actor / audio dialogue is needed, but it's bearable.\n\nSo far, it's a fun game to play!
