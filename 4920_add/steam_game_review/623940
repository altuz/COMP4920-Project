Most of the reviews you'll read on here are going to be people who either just found this game and are wondering what all the fuss is about, or people who've been waiting for this game to come out ever since the Kickstarter launched in 2012, and are just overjoyed to finally play it. I will admit, I belong to the latter group.\n\nBut if you want an honest review of this game, it's fantastic. The music is beautiful, the animation and artwork is fantastic, and it captures the comedy and storytelling style of Homestuck perfectly, without being completely impenetrable or falling into the bullshit the original story did. Is it more enjoyable if you've read that monstrosity of a webcomic? Yes. Is it still a really good game? Also yes. Hiveswap doesn't limit itself to Homestuck references, but branches into every aspect of the 90s, right down to poorly-disguised cameo posters for Metroid or The Neverending Story.\n\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I've seen is that there isn't enough play time to warrant its 8-dollar asking price. And it is certainly true that you *can*beat the game in two-ish hours. You can also spend twice that time and not even clear the house you start out in. It all depends on whether you feel like discovering every hidden dialog line and reaction. When they say you can combine everything with everything, they mean it. Every item can be used on every piece of background and every other item. Pog jokes abound, and there's a shocking amount of story you can discover just by poking around and trying things. \n\n\ntl;dr:\nIf you just want puzzles and nothing else, Hiveswap is not for you. If you want to explore a beautifully drawn and written story with some puzzles and gameplay on top, Hiveswap is a great game.

And it's actually pretty damn good! [b]IT'S A MODERN DAY MIRACLE![/b]\n\n...ahem. Look, it's hard for me to stay calm and collected about this, okay? But putting aside my fangirl bias for the moment, there's no denying that Hiveswap is a success story. It's a fun and enjoyable adventure game that will delight both long-term fans of the Homestuck webcomic and complete newcomers alike.\n\n[h1]The Art[/h1]\n\n[b]The backgrounds. Are. GORGEOUS.[/b] My god, they're beautiful. Filled with personality, vibrant colours and a million little fun details, every single backdrop is a joy to behold. I often found myself pausing and simply appreciating the art, trying to take it all in and find any hidden jokes. The character animations were also nice and smooth, with different body language given to each character, and the animated cutscenes looked amazing. All in all a very eye-pleasing experience on all counts.\n\n[h1]The Music[/h1]\n\n[b]OF COURSE[/b] the music is good. Let me ask you something, have you ever listened to Homestuck music that wasn't awesome? If you don't actually know the answer to this question, it's \"No I haven't, all Homestuck music ever created is genius, implying Homestuck music can be bad is a paradox unto itself and a punishable offense.\" I mean okay, maybe the first couple of tracks are not [i]that[/i] memorable, but once you get to the strife battle music it's absolute headbangers all around. (I'm seriously kicking myself for not buying the soundtrack edition, if you're reading this DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE just go for it.)\n\n[h1]The Writing[/h1]\n\nHussie, you magnificent bastard, you've done it again. You've struck gold. The game is joke after joke after joke, followed by slightly depressing introspection, then followed again by even more jokes, usually of the black humour variety. And it's all done in Homestuck's inimitable signature style, with the meta narration that's speaking directly to you the player, or maybe it's the character's inner narration, or maybe it's the character acknowledging the narrator? Also, puns. If you've read the comic you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about, and you will feel immediately comforted by the familiarity of it all. If you [i]haven't[/i] read the comic I'm still willing to bet you'll be amused, or at the very least appreciate the unique sense of humour. (and hey if you like the game you can always give homestuck a try [strike]and get irreversibly sucked into the convoluted magnificent epicness of it all and invest all your waking hours to reading it till you're nothing but a former husk of yourself[/strike] actually you know what nevermind)\n\nSpeaking of, I [i]have[/i] to mention all those sweet sweet Homestuck references! I was honestly a bit worried about this part, afraid they'd be clumsily shoehorned in just for the sake of fanservice, but nope! They're all subtle and seemingly innocuous, more like a sly wink than an obnoxious honk. The end result is that fans will feel the exciting jolt of recognition that comes from having extra context, while newcomers won't feel alienated and probably won't even notice the reference flying over their heads. (At least until you get to Alternia. Then those who've read the comic will be completely at ease in the familiar environment, and those who haven't will uh.... will be thrust headfirst into a super weird, vaguely disturbing alien world where everyday objects are bug themed and have bizzaro names instead? Have fun with the culture shock!)\n\nAs for the storyline, since this is only Act 1 the game understandably spends most of its time introducing the world and setting up the pieces, with the mystery behind the plot creating more questions than answers. However where the game truly shines is in the characters. One of Hussie's greatest strengths as a writer is his ability to create memorable lovable characters, and he's worked his magic once again. All the new kids are cute and endearing (Joey is [b]MY SWEET PRECIOUS CHILD[/b] and I will love her forever) with their own distinct personalities, and all their interactions with each another are incredibly fun to read. They're definitely worthy additions to the Homestuck pantheon of characters.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\n\nWhen it comes to point-and-click games, Hiveswap is admittedly on the easy side. You will never be stuck with incomprehensible puzzles or need to consult a guide to proceed, and you'll naturally obtain all useful items during normal exploration. You also can't die/fail, so even if you're having trouble with a sequence you can just experiment with your inventory till you get it. And trust me, you really [i]really[/i] want to experiment, because all items can interact in all possible combinations and give funny lines. Let me repeat that: [b]ALL ITEM COMBINATIONS GIVE UNIQUE FUNNY LINES.[/b] And I'm not talking about lame variations of \"I can't do that\", I'm talking genuinely funny and long lines, in the writing I praised so much before. I'd honestly argue that reading all these descriptions is the meat of the game, so if you prefer exploration to puzzle-solving in your adventure games this will be right up your alley.\n\nTo be fair, the game is also on the short side, though I don't think that's a particular downside. After taking my time and going slowly I finished in about 4 hours, which may not sound like a lot but it actually felt good enough for me. There's a ton of content (unless you rush, and why would you?) to go through, and the overall quality plus the cheapness of the price make it hard to complain.\n\n[h1]So, Should You Buy This Game?[/h1]\n\nIf you're homestuck trash like me then you already slammed that purchase button the second it appeared. Enough said.\n\nIf you're a Homestuck fan who is apprehensive after being burned one too many times, fear not: It's a good game. I mean it's not the second coming of christ or anything so don't get your expectations TOO high, but it's also not some soulless money grab. It's obvious a lot of love and care went into this, and playing it will remind you why you fell in love with the comic in the first place.\n\nAnd if you've never heard of Homestuck and never plan on ever changing that, you absolutely have a place here as well. This is a charming and funny adventure game that will keep you entertained for an evening or two, and you're bound to enjoy it if you're a fan of the genre.\n\nTo sum up, Hiveswap is a fun game that left me very satisfied, and I'm eagerly awaiting its continuation with Act 2.

I was ecstatic. I got into college and remained excited. I graduated college, and remained hopeful. Hiveswap arrived. And all is forgiven.\nI'm the kind of guy that goes into games exploring and checking everything possible. I've played point-and-click games Venus, where I get disappointed when I'm constantly barraged by the same soundclip of the protagonist saying \"I can't do that\". When I began playing Hiveswap, I was astounded. I got stuck in Joey's room for a full hour. And not because of a puzzle, but from my own volition. I tried every single item and hotspot combination. And I was fascinated by what I read. I became satisfied when I began getting achievements for trying seemingly innocuous combinations, which was super satisfying. After 8 hours, across a couple of days, I managed to finish Act 1. I was extremely satisfied. I even tried my hand at playing the game all over again, this time skipping all the flavor text. It took me around 15 minutes. That's when I realized my first playthrough was exactly how this game is squeezed out of its content.\nI for one found myself relieved with the change of graphics from 3D to 2D. It feels so much more like Homestuck in that way.\nThe music is just absolutely marvelous. I found myself tapping my foot, my knees, humming along with the music in each room. Even the characters, I gotta say, are a big step up from the source material. Through the constant use of the items and skills in the characters' sylladexes and strife specibi, I got to understand their motivations. Joey's feelings against POGs, Bubsy and her father as well as Xefros' feelings towards his own hobbies and culture.\nI really can't wait to see what comes next. 5 years of waiting were worth it, at least for me.", "recommendationid": "35042328", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581094", "timestamp_created": 1505728989, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 450, "playtime_forever": 684, "last_played": 1506051654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "steamid": "76561198026512670"}, "votes_up": 48}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505413570, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 33, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 10, "review": "Can't believe it's finally out, if you're a homestuck fan chances are you already bought this, but if you haven't you should", "recommendationid": "34954443", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576766", "timestamp_created": 1505413570, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 20, "playtime_forever": 182, "last_played": 1506014491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "steamid": "76561198119660382"}, "votes_up": 99}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505447881, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "I can't believe I waited this long for it.\n\nAnd it wasn't terrible.
