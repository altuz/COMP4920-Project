There are quite a few games that claim to be coop that can really be played just as well single player, but Lazer Cops is not among them. The cool lazer tether mechanic in this game really favors having a buddy cop or two at your side, and the way it makes you work together can lead to some fun moments.\n\nThe game has a varity of different levels that give you the chance to explore the different ways in which the lazer tether mechanic can be used. Some of them are harder than others, but fortunately you can skip to any level within a zone at any time, so you aren't blocked on the levels that don't appeal to your playstyle.\n\nAll told, it's a fun ride if you have the right squad of friends to back you up.", "recommendationid": "33018583", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1498787757, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 31, "playtime_forever": 271, "last_played": 1498357326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036252937"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497655941, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I like the asthetic.  It's a combination of the pixel art you would see in 80s 8-bit games, and the neon vector art you would see on the boxes/posters/cabinets of 80s games.  As such there is a slight mismatch of styles on the same screen, but nevertheless it is pretty.\n\nI find the single player mode to be too difficult for me, even on easy.  Clearly the game was designed for 2 or more players.  The only way I could imagine this sort of gameplay working for a single player game is with an AI companion.\n\nI am looking forward to inviting some friends over to play it together.", "recommendationid": "32488645", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500674", "timestamp_created": 1497655941, "author": {"num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 858, "playtime_forever": 75, "last_played": 1500232803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999923551"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497745703, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I think this is an interesting game. New mechanics with the tether system. Also a little like ikaruga in parts. It is pretty hard alone. I have played the piano so I can do two different things with my hands to some extent. \n\nIf I would have one critisim of the game is that many of the levels feel pretty cramped and it is pretty easy to bump into your friend and get caught. It means you kinda have to know the level in advance. I wished the game was a little faster and bigger. \n\nOverall worth a pickup if you want a fun thing to play with a friend.", "recommendationid": "32522214", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497352", "timestamp_created": 1497745703, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 273, "playtime_forever": 104, "last_played": 1497730238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042236250"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
