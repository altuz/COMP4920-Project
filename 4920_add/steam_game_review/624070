It has been up on my front page feed for at least 3 weeks everyday under Recommended. It's been in my Explore que a few times. It's just non-stop! And I did not want to buy this game. It looked like an old RPG that time forgot. Those types of games are good for nostalgia, but rarely warrant jumping in blindly and playing without that air of familiarity. However, the game was on sale for $6 and Steam just wouldn\u2019t leave me alone; so I finally made the purchase and dove in with no prior knowledge of the game. Well, Dragon Wars is the type of game that needs nostalgia for you to play it and it's exactly why I am requesting a refund. \n\nFirst off, the game defaults to crappy graphics. This was a game from back in the day when you had to tell the game what type of monitor you had and what type of graphics it could display. I guess they wanted to play it safe for the Steam release and kept the graphics to default at CGA. That means a color palette of white, purple, and cyan. 3 whole colors! \n\nTo fix this: Go to the game directory. Open dosboxDragonWars_single.conf and the 3rd from last line that says \"DRAGON\" change it to \"DRAGON CONFIG\". Save the file and run the game. At the config screen select option E, Press S to save and RETURN to start the game in all it's 16 color glory! (Hopefully you are one of the lucky players that have a 16 color capable monitor ;)\n\nThe sound is midi and not good midi! The loading screen's music is jarring for today's standards. In-game there was pretty much no sound for me. There is a weird beep that plays every time I move. It sounds more like an error sound than a move sound; so there's probably some work that needs to be done to DOSBox to get the sound to play right. I tried searching on the web but the only thing I could find was that the Amiga version was 10x better in sound and graphics and that it's shameful they didn't put that version up for sale. Since I've never played this game I really don't know what the differences are.\n\nThe manual to the game is included in the install folder. You're going to need it. I also recommend going to gameFAQS.com and reading up as well. I've spent nearly 2 hours on this game, just reading and getting ready to play. Eventually I decided, enough reading, just get in there and get some game time. You can import Bard's Tale players into this game, but the manual warns they will be stripped down versions. I do have Bard's Tale, but did not try to create a character in it. I just started the game with the 4 default players.\n\nThe game itself looks similar to Might and Magic 2, but feels like a NES version of that type of game. Walls are 2D, meaning there is no depth. When looking at a wall from the side it looks like a paper's edge. Controls are basic, but not bad. Not like some older DOS games that had terrible controls, at least this game gets by pretty good with a mouse and a few key presses. However, you may want to edit the DOSBox config file to lower the mouse sensitivity as my mouse was darting back and forth way too quickly to really play.\n\nI'm pretty sure the default toons had magic, but no spells were known; so I had only attack to use. The gameFAQS walkthrough suggested using toons that I did not have access to as starting characters. I'm guessing they meant me to delete and create new players, but I did not take the time. I wanted to get into the game and see if it was any good before I continued to invest time and effort into it.\n\nThe lack of sound makes the game feel sterile while playing. You just keep clicking attack and the bottom of the screen tells you if you hit, but there's no oomph, no way to feel your attacks. Also distance is a feature/issue. Mobs are displayed as: 5 DRUNKS 40'. That means they are 40 feet away. Unfortunately the graphics don't represent this as mobs are only ever one size and position. That's right in front of you taking up half the navigation window. Also mobs are not singled out. There could be 5 drunks, but you only see one. It further distances your engagement with the game. I\u2019m guessing mobs are random encounters because you never see anything in the distance. They just show up on the screen ready to attack. This adds to the NES feel and less of a PC game. Also draw distance of walls are only 3 or 4 tiles away. Expect to look at barren nothingness most of the game.\n\nThe story element was sparse as well. You get a quick text window that says you're in purgatory and that's about it. From there I suppose you're to find the story. Also, one cool feature of the game is occasionally you're asked to go to a page in the manual to read part of the description for a certain place. That was nice, but not a big enough saving factor.\n\nHonestly, this game did not stand up well to the test of time. I'm sure there are players out there willing to defend this game and explain its greatness, but I am not one. I never played this game before and do not care to play it any further. It's sad the game requires you to set up its graphics and the sound is so poor. Perhaps I should look up the Amiga version. \n\nThe manual boasts that it took 2 years to create this game. I\u2019ve played games older than this that felt much more feature rich and involved. I\u2019m not certain why this game needed a 2 year dev cycle. One interesting note is the Bard\u2019s Tale character import. I read on the web that Dragon Wars was to be a Bard\u2019s Tale sequel, but it was changed near release. I\u2019m guessing Interplay themselves realized the poor workmanship of this game and decided to save the Bard\u2019s Tale brand from such a poor title.\n\nFor $10 USD this game is asking a fairly high price, especially considering it's not the best version of this game. I would only recommend to those who already played and enjoyed the game in the 90's. Or those players who thoroughly enjoyed Bard's Tale or Might and Magic. If you happened to play those titles and really liked them, I'm talking played them till the end, and did that in the last 5 years, not 20 years ago played them, then this game is for you. Hopefully, now that I bought this damn game and refunded it, Steam will stop recommending it to me.", "recommendationid": "34090030", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515552", "timestamp_created": 1502141359, "author": {"num_reviews": 176, "num_games_owned": 898, "playtime_forever": 44, "last_played": 1502143199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992234603"}, "votes_up": 36}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503449997, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fun, old-school RPG.
