The graphics are gorgeous and the story just keeps you guessing and every new clue leads you down another trial. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of mystery games. I was nervous initially because there weren't very many reviews yet when I purchased it, but I'm so glad I took a chance on this game!

The town is abandoned yet you always feel like you are being watched.
