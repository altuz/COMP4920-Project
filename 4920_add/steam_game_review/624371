The different classes they have in the game are each amazing in its own way. The openness of the world combines with the amount of possibilites you can make your character into it really is beautiful. The way you can change your characters appearance makes you feel more attached to your role play. It has beautiful and unbelieveable combat for being an MMORPG. The game is cheap but it will cost money if you want to go above and beyond but thats prefectly fine. I would suggest getting the deal because it will allow you to get a very good mount and allows you a pet of choice with many other things included. The Value Pack mentioned above was an old negative review that we can ignore now because it was fixed very fast, thank you BDO for your support.
