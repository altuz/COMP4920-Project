Super 3D Noah's Ark is not included because it is on Steam as a separate product. This release is of interest to enthusiasts in studying video game history and depictions of Christianity in late 20th century Western popular culture and it is nostalgia bait for anyone who remembers these games from their day. The gameplay does not stand out as especially great, but some of the included games (like Joshua and Spiritual Warfare) manage to avoid being completely bad.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about these games is how they were released on the NES and Gameboy unlicensed by Nintendo in order to circumvent not only Nintendo's anti-competitive DRM (Digiital Restrictions Management) but also Nintendo's anti-religious censorship policy. Ever heard of banned books? These are banned games. This is something Nintendo did not want you to play.\n\nHowever, only the MS-DOS versions are included here, which is sad because there are NES, Gameboy and Sega Genesis versions of these which you could totally play on your own emulators and flash carts if only they included the ROMs but they haven't. So you can still only play them that way if you are a dirty pirate-sinner. (I recommend the Sega Genesis versions personally)\n\nOverall, this release needs a little more love and attention than it has thus far received. It should have extras included like scans of the original manuals, box art, TV commercials and historical information which just isn't here. Wisdom Tree cracked their own DRM so that you don't have to deal with that nonsense, but they've included neither the uncracked floppy disk images of the original releases for historical reference (I don't remember what their DRM was even like) nor DRM-free floppy disk installers for those who want to run these on genuine vintage hardware.\n\nI'm not even sure DOSBOX is running these at the proper speed. Alot of things feel like they're missing. So, while Wisdom Tree has saved these titles from being considered abandonware (Why isn't \"Captain Bible in Dome of Darkness\" on Steam!?) and we should respect that, it hasn't really stepped up its game for attracting its niche audience of Christian retrogaming enthusiasts either.", "recommendationid": "33660315", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542927", "timestamp_created": 1500501503, "author": {"num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 2992, "playtime_forever": 8, "last_played": 1500501496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024973923"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500344669, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Honestly, if you've read up on any of these games and played them, you're not going to expect much here. It's the same games as they were on the NES and Genesis, but on DOS, which is interesting, because I never knew they were available on DOS. They control the same, they feel the same, they even look and sound the same (disregarding sound and graphics cards of the time).\n\nIf you want some odd bible games in your collection, this will certainly do the trick.
