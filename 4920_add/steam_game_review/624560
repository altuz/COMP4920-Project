Any semblance of plot is left around the environment in notes you have to pick up. I wasn't keen on the whole \"read everything\" to get the story, I get some people enjoy that but it's not for me.\n\nIt's mostly just another \"horror walking simulator\" with a few interactive bits thrown in. The environment is pretty cool but I was hoping for more of a sprawling maze dungeon, what I got was mostly just a linear corridor with some spooky atmosphere.\n\nThe real reason why I wouldn't recommend it though is just the bugs:\n\n- Anything you pick up just floats in mid-air when you drop it, instead of having any physics.\n- The bow and arrow weapon attaches to your body incorrectly. When you equip the bow from your inventory it comes out in an awkward angle and you have to keep trying to re-equip it to get the right angle.\n- Similar problem when trying to place arrows into your quiver, sometimes it won't even catch them and they will suspend in mid-air instead of being stored and then remain where you left them when you walk off. It is extemely frustrating to try and get them to store properly.\n- Sometimes an arrow doesn't even fire, it just suspends in mid-air with no physics similar to any other dropped item.\n- I didn't bother playing further but I've heard its only 1-2 hours long. That wouldn't be worth the asking price in my opinion.\n\nIt is however worth mentioning some positives that they managed to pull off:\n- Proper Oculus Rift support (not just Steam VR)\n- Solid Free Locomotion support with several options available for orientation, smooth/snap turning.\n- Actually uses the Rift's finger sensing tech in a unique and useful way, by extending your finger it will hit-scan the environment from where you are pointing and highlight anything that can be picked up, then you can press the grip button to pick it up. A great use of a more or less unused mechanic of the Touch Controllers.\n\nOverall dissapointing though. Either give it a miss or at least check back in a few weeks time, hopefully they have sorted out the bugs then.", "recommendationid": "31965420", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504174", "timestamp_created": 1495774911, "author": {"num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 564, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1495774306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197965583985"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496090291, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I cannot recommend the VR version of the game in the current state.
