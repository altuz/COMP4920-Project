If you play for over an hour, you're clearly a nihilistic suicidal murderous psychopath with low self-esteem and developmental problems [spoiler] aka current presidential material [/spoiler]\n\nMy therapist said I was one, but I could only play this game for ~20 minutes.\n\nRating 2/10 Not worth it, not even for free.  Only download and play if you hate yourself.  [spoiler] Even with Pacman, the music was not this annoying and once you ate all the \"coins\" the level would end and you could eat your enemies with powerups ... not so in this nightmare endless maze with dumb AI enemies [/spoiler]", "recommendationid": "34896133", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1505198505, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1505198058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
