However, I would have liked to see a lot more variety in enemies, random attack waves, and formations. I have a lot of fond memories and hours invested in 'Uridium' and sadly this felt lacking in a lot of areas. I was hoping and expecting a lot deeper gameplay if I'm honest.\nThis might be a poor mans clone but for the price I can't complain. Hopefully 'Promethium 2' will be more like the original 'Uridium' I was looking for.\n\nGame Details:\nInspired by classic Commodore 64 and arcade games, Promethium is a hard-as-nails retro inspired side-scrolling shoot-em-up that takes place over numerous levels that get harder and harder.
