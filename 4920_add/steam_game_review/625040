Rather than having to hit spots to grow you fully circle animals to consume them, the difficulty of the game comes from if you complete your circle not on your tale you lose that much tale. What the game lacks is variety with enemies not offering much differ in the challenge, 4 bosses which you deal in the same way each time. The games central core has 40 minutes of game time, you do have 2 additional modes but these do not add variety to the challenges on offer and at the price makes me question the value of the product. Great little game but too little on offer to be called anything more than a student project.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/F4mqnLllvQU", "recommendationid": "31954424", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510133", "timestamp_created": 1495728171, "author": {"num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 223, "playtime_forever": 48, "last_played": 1495728784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994868319"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500130934, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This [i] should [/i] have been a good game.
