It is _very_ rough around the edges, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.\n\nThe story is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi piece that's mainly told through notes that you find. You start out as a \"colonist\" with erased memory in a strictly regulated society, and are tasked to relive and preserve the memories of other people, but you learn soon that things might not be quite as they seem. The author clearly isn't a native speaker, so the writing isn't great, but it's at least understandable, and I found the story interesting enough. There are a few twists that encourage players to draw their own conclusions and to question the information they have been told before.\n\nThe player will visit and explore \"memories\" as 3d simulations. Due to this, gameplay is not limited to the sci-fi facility you live in, you'll also visit places like a lighthouse in ancient Greece or Stonehenge in the 19th century. While all the maps are fairly small, the variety of environments is appreciated.\n\nOn each map, you have to solve a small puzzle. Usually this involves finding a few objects that have been placed in different rooms and applying them at the right spot, or activating switches in the correct order. The puzzles are fairly simple and straightforward. Most objects that you can interact with are highlighted when you go near, so it's hard to miss them.\n\nGraphics are okay for a small Indie game - often a bit crude and bland, but there are also some genuinely beautiful spots. Unfortunately the game is extremely dark, even with brightness set to the maximum. Sound is barely existent throughout.\n\nThe controls are unfortunately terrible. The player character moves at an excruciatingly slow speed, and sometimes gets blocked by invisible walls. There are places on ramps where I got stuck until I jumped forward even though no obstacle was to be seen at the ground. Keys cannot be remapped. The game lacks even the most basic usability features - or, to be precise, a mouse sensitivity slider and an \"invert Y axis\" option are provided, but nothing else. Even graphics quality can only be changed between 4 presets, settings for individual features are not available.\n\nThis game was developed by just two people from Belarus, using the free Unity Personal engine. This may easily ring warning bells in some customers' ears, considering the wave of very low quality first-person adventure games that have swashed onto Steam from the CIS region lately. However, let's keep in mind that the existence of _many_ shoddy games from one region and genre, does not mean that _all_ of these games are automatically terrible. I feel that \"A Second Before Us\", while definitely crude and primitive in many ways, is a notch above those aforementioned games due to its interesting story, varied environments, clear puzzle design, and serviceable writing.\n\nAt the same time though, I think that this game is not sophisticated enough to justify its 9\u20ac asking price. Hence it does get my recommendation, but I would also recommend to wait on a sale. I bought it at 75% off, and felt that that price was appropriate for what I got.", "recommendationid": "33750573", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519830", "timestamp_created": 1500836319, "author": {"num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 7640, "playtime_forever": 252, "last_played": 1500837271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025309409"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499836546, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "run needs to be toggled not pressed, the game is too short while feeling too long, the story is not engaging enough to keep you interested, and the puzzles are not puzzles.
