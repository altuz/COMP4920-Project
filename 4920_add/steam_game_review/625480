It helps me a lot!\n\n1) In the main menu click on  video source and select your webcam, resolution, frame rate and bitrate.\n2) In the main menu click Assign Controllers and select your VIVE controller or tracker.\nYou can easily discover the index of your controller by checking the bottom half transparent bar. It shows numbers and info if the device is tracked or not. If you click on the number the corresponding device should vibrate or blink.\nIf the correct tracker blinks you know the index which you have to setup\nin the Assign controller menu.\n3) In the main menu click Calibrate Camera and follow the steps on the screen.\n4) Export the file where you want.\nYou can ignore the other values in the cfg or you can delete them.\nI will update the generation of the cfg file so You can manually setup what should be exported everytime.\nFor example Blue Effect VR which I programmed supports much detailed config than regular Valve config file.\n\nThank you for your time!\n", "review": "Been looking for a easier way to sync up the camera but unfortunately this did not work for me, I don't think it supports the virtual controller (which I use as the camera) if it does support then maybe I'm not using it right, also the cfg file it generates is different from the one I usually use aswell as the normal X,y and z values it has a lot of others which I have no idea what they mean, the near and far value is always at 0 so when I load up a game the camera view is blank, I have to manually set the near and far which fixes that issue but I assume it knocks all my other settings out of whack.\nThis tool could be good for someone with a vive tracker or another controller also someone who knows what all the other values mean but not for me I just wanted something simple.\nI reccomend that others with more knowledge try it as it may just be me who has the issues.\nI put a thumbs up because the above problems could well be my issue", "recommendationid": "31329572", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499938", "timestamp_created": 1492986229, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_forever": 24, "last_played": 1496350850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007644650"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
