I think there should be a lot of fans of the game. \n\nThis game is so hard that i managed to get 10 % progress after 6 hours!  Designed obviously for hardcore gamers.\n\nGameplay:  \n\nThe game has novel appoaches like you throw your weapon and jump over and you take your weapon to reach higher platforms. Weapons are varied and have different physics. \n\nYou only have 3 lives in a level and when you hit by something you lose one heart but not become invincible for a few seconds (which make the game so much challenging). I recommend the developer to put at least 1 second invinciblity in that situations or as a difficulty option. \n\nWhen facing the enemy they are hard to kill and if you appoach them a little bit they steal your weapon immidiately and use against you.\n\nObstacles are hard to overcome and varied. You can double jump to avoid them but it is not easy and irreversible if you fail. \n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you like old style gaming, graphics are very well designed and the gameplay contributes far more than the old games.\n\nMaybe the hardest platformer i have ever played, you get the success feeling even without getting gold medal (the game is intentionally desinged for speedrun but even finishing the levels is quite difficult).\n\nConsidering a very long gameplay time, this is also a value choice.\n\nIt is fun!", "recommendationid": "32017215", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1495969061, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 239, "last_played": 1495889947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198391275619"}, "votes_up": 0}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502743418, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\nIt is very well done, with nice animations and decent sound.
