The price is luckily now reduced, it was at 20$ at launch on Home, where the today's price is much more reasonable and in line with the PC version.\n\nSmashing the Battle VR is a furious hack and slash game, focused almost totally on fighting and big combos against countless robots. The exploration side is tiny, there are instead tons of unlockables and some powerup for your avatar. The overall amount of things to do, levels to beat, objectives to reach will cover many hours: on the other hand, it's a button smashing over and over so if you don't like this kind of gameplay, get old easily. To me, Smashing the Battle is surely good enough to well worth his price, I've two hours in it and count to spend more.\n\nCharacterization is peculiar, with busty anime girls with huge blades and armors. The game do not take himself seriously, and I appreciate his irony and surreal dialogues before and during stages. It's a kind of style you could like or dislike anyway, especially if you're an impatient player easy to \"skip\" any intro for instant action. Smashing the Battle uses an external camera with fixed distance and rotation and a bidimensional scrolling. We had many experiments of this kind in the Oculus Dev Kit era, unfortunately almost all abandoned (Meltdown was so similiar to Smashing the Battle for example, it's very bad they stopped to support VR). Not the most immersive perspective you can get, but works and is also quite comfortable to use.\n\nImportant thing to know: I suggest this one only if you own a gamepad (and are fine in playing seated) Vive wands are supported but simply they're the wrong device for a beat'em up.", "recommendationid": "32511973", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517044", "timestamp_created": 1497720446, "author": {"num_reviews": 132, "num_games_owned": 290, "playtime_forever": 265, "last_played": 1497973543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969101080"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497756645, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Suprisingly funny and refreshing Game in VR.

Seems like it will be kind of repetative in the long run,  but what's there controls solidly and the VR is done well.  I think third person games work very well in VR,  and I hope we get more of them.  \n\nPros:  The art is nice, the graphics are decent, the models and animation are good, and there are things to unlock in game.  Controls better than I expected,  but I'll admit to low expecations.  \n\n\nCons:  I'm not sure how much variety there will be in the levels,  doesn't seem like there will be much.  The music seems like it's glitching out in slow motion sometimes.  \n\nThumbs up as long as you realize what you're getting.", "recommendationid": "32496883", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506483", "timestamp_created": 1497685411, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 781, "playtime_forever": 18, "last_played": 1497682587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977172115"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498495510, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Its like a God of War type action game with amazing graphics and perspective like you're controlling a little action figure.\n\nActually I wouldn't mind playing God of War like this.\nControls with the Vive controller are pretty smooth.  \n\nAnd the playfield is at about chest level while standing so no neck strain from looking down.", "recommendationid": "32821637", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1498494985, "author": {"num_reviews": 127, "num_games_owned": 185, "playtime_forever": 43, "last_played": 1498578259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063942102"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497702875, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's obvious from the short time i've had with the game, that the team have put an effort in to the vr version of this. The vive controls work perfectly.

Seems like there's plenty to be had in the way of progression of the character, xp, armour upgrades, unlocks.\n\nI enjoy these types of miniture styled games, this one ranks up there in the fun factor alone with others like blaze rush and final approach, which in VR give you a child like playing with your toys feel, that can't be matched on a normal screen. like the other review rightly points out, it's clear and crisp in it's graphics, and the animations work well.\n\nA well worked neat game with everything you expect these days, a welcome edition to the vr space at a decent price.", "recommendationid": "32503209", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1497702875, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 103, "playtime_forever": 266, "last_played": 1499190793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999119601"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498946233, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'm not a big brawler fan, but this is a lot of fun!!", "recommendationid": "33103474", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491529", "timestamp_created": 1498946233, "author": {"num_reviews": 143, "num_games_owned": 371, "playtime_forever": 50, "last_played": 1498946096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198258022771"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
