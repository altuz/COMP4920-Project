I restarted the game a few times and went back and redid things (thanks to having numerous saves) so the hours are kinda misleading. With that aside, this game is one I honestly didn't know what to think about at first. The first area was pretty rough and difficult and I didn't know if I would make it through. However, once I got through it the game really took off and I loved every minute of it. There is so much to this game that you wouldn't realize. There is hidden lore everywhere and things you have to look hard to find that will add to everything.\n\nI'm not someone who can really go into deep detail about things like you'd expect in a review, but I really just like almost everything about this game. I can't say the game is completely perfect because there are some typos and little things but that's really all I can complain about. All of the other issues I've had the developers have worked to fix. That is a big thing for me. The developers are willing to listen to the players and make changes based on what we say. I don't know that many who would do that. \n\nSeriously, if you are a fan of RPGs I'd give this game a try. I highly recommend this game!", "recommendationid": "33550145", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "timestamp_created": 1500088019, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 7834, "last_played": 1505882073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198186618269"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499774920, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A pretty decent RPG maker game.\n\nThe devs listen to feedback.\n\nProduction value wise the presentation is much better compared to 90% of other RPG Maker games on Steam.\n\nGameplay wise, it is standard RPG Maker, albeit with a bit wider customization.\n\nCan't say too much about writing, but there  are efforts for world building which make it better than a lot of other RPG Maker games.\n\nVerdict: above average, buy it if you like RPG Maker style games", "recommendationid": "33454430", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "timestamp_created": 1499774920, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 128, "last_played": 1498756852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063506153"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
