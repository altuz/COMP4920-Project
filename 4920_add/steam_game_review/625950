Worth negative 20 cents.  \n  This is pure garbage. \n  Needs a DMCA revocation for using non liscensed movie pictures at least for profit.\n  If you want the SAME game, go to a site that requires a CAPTCHA login recognition system.  It's the same thing. \n  Consists of 20 pictures to look at and click letters of the picture.\n  I am ashamed I bought this, even with a coupon. STEAM should not allow this shovelware garbage on it's service.  Gabe allows junk like this to ruin a service.\n  My fault for buying this shovelware trash.\n\n  Harsh review, but allowing junk like this is what kills the game industry, and looks like they are stealing content from movies.
