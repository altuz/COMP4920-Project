At least Digital \nHomicicde took pride in their work (for some unknown reason) \nCould you say the same thing about the stumblebums over at Illfonic?\nAnd the Romine brothers had a serious work ethic. Those guys relesead 13 games\nin 2016! That is an impressive feat. Meanwhile the Tomato cans over at Illfonic \nwait months and months and months and months just to release a patch that fixes \nmajor game breaking bugs. That's if they even bother to fix it at all. \nDead Alliance is for all intents and purposes a high budget version of \nThe Slaughtering Grounds.\n\n\n\nThis is Illfonics first game lol\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cJD1eTam7RA\n\n\n\nIllfonic then went on to \"work on\" Star Marine as part of Star Citizen.\nThese geniuses built the assets to the wrong scale and in the wrong engine!!\nLOL\nThis offcourse got them fired in humiliating fashion by Cloud Imperium Games.\nLOL AGAIN\nIllfonic then \"borrowed\" the Star Citizen Business model (A ponzi scheme)\nAnd used the \"loot\" to make Friday the 13th which is a terribly broken game.\nThey have released a couple of patches for this game, which have only made\nthe game MORE broken.\nTRIPLE LOL\n\nhttps://youtu.be/d3-8_RdNLQw\n\n\nThen they abandoned Friday the 13th to release Dead Alliance....\n\n\n\n\nI think this video below accurately describes illfonics attitude towards making\n\"games\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xhaPvmqqIS0", "recommendationid": "34764911", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503625", "timestamp_created": 1504646827, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 0, "playtime_forever": 74, "last_played": 1504480854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198418775567"}, "votes_up": 20}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504751917, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Needs alot of work done on it.

I mean this was shipped out for 40 bucks? This game plays and feels like a crappy bootleg Call Of Duty clone, it's gunplay feels like just another shooter nothing special about it, than you have the crappy animations and the terrible balancing system! It's terrible, I mean they had to remarket the damn thing and it's just the same thing but with a single-player mode![/i]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The gameplay feels not natural and it doesn't help that the hit detection is garbage -/-\n[*]The only big difference and potential this game has is the zombies and how the become weaponized +/+\n[*]There is not a whole lot of content in the game you have multiplayer, single player horde mode and bots, not worth the retail price -/-\n[/list]\n[b] + 15 Points [/b]\n\n[h1]Graphics, Audio, and Port[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Game looks like a glorious mess, in a good way, the graphics are surprisingly well textured and clean, good job +/+\n[*]The optimization is not where it should be and it doesn't help that the gameplay is in bad condition, I get 44 FPS on high with a GTX 970 and AMD FX-8350, this is not good. -/-\n[*]The game has alright audio, it at least sounds decent +/-\n[/list]\n[b]+ 15 Points[/b]\n\n[h1] Marketing and Prices[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Game at least gives you the option to experience less shit with a reduced price between Multiplayer and the Full Game Upgrade (Adds single player ops, horde) +/-\n[*]At Least had the niceness in there hearts to give the full game to the people who buyed Moving Hazard, Thanks I guess +/+\n[*]The retail price is a joke, maybe just maybe buy on a sale with some of the new updates maybe it will be worth more than what it is right now. -/-\n[/list]\n[b]+ 15 points[/b]\n\n[h1]The game earned 45 points it's a little below above average.
