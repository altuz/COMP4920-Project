I was apprehensive about buying a game in Early Access, but this is a game that your money should totally be invested towards. There is a ton of dialogue and back story that has so many options that you can choose from. The game follows the premise of Mass Effect and Deus Ex in its ability to customize and free roam with no \"linear\" goal. This is a game that will never be the same replay after replay.\n\nI definitely recommend supporting Interdimensional Games and Consortium, and help encourage great gamplay and not just great graphics.", "recommendationid": "35166453", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514549", "timestamp_created": 1506210124, "author": {"num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 502, "playtime_forever": 339, "last_played": 1506629544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 339, "steamid": "76561197983978320"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506734460, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is no joke.
