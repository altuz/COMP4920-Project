I personally like the concept as it feels to me like it has a lot of potential, Such as certain Items coming down the chute, a way to disobey your boss and get away with it, Stealing Items then keeping them, suicide, cool eater eggs and more. I completely understand that this is early access, but It's not finished yet. I found 2 bugs in 36 minutes, one being when I threw an item from one chute and missed, and it fell down the side and into the chute next to it? The other being when the one day ends, the next one begins with the same amount of X's, but when I get an X, it only says I've got one X. The Days were way too fast, and the amount of post coming was too much, I couldn't keep up at all. The first day got too repetitive just sitting their sorting post, I feel that this game has  a lot of potential though although I have said that before.\n\n[B]Pros[/B]:\n- Cool Concept\n- Planned Frequent Updates\n\n[B]Cons[/B]:\n- Lots of Bugs\n- Repetitive\n- Feels like you could fit everything into a place where you didn't have to teleport.\n- Needs more testing\n\nThis game is a wonderful idea, but I honestly feel it's not ready to be on steam yet, should of gone through more testing by different people to the developers.", "recommendationid": "31478536", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511356", "timestamp_created": 1493611954, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 833, "playtime_forever": 52, "last_played": 1493611994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064383295"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
