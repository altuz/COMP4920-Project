A \"how many words can you make\" game with an RPG and timing gimmick.  It's very similar to the old Bookworm Adventures game from PopCap, which is not a bad thing.  \n\nYou're given a set of 10 pseudo-randomly generated tiles that you will use to make words.  Your character marches from the left of each level towards the right, stopping whenever he reaches a new enemy.  A timer starts at the same time, indicating when the enemy will attack.  A good vocabulary and decent typing speed will help you kill enemies before they can attack.  The longer your words, the more damage you'll do.  \n\nYou obviously can't use the same word twice on a level (that would make beating the enemies fairly trivial).  Part of the challenge is saving the longer words that you think of for the most powerful enemies on a level so that you don't have to resort to wimpy, 3-letter attacks.\n\nAs you progress you'll earn gold and items that you use to buy upgrades to your gear.  Each piece of gear has special abilities.  One of the early unlocks is a monster guide that you can use to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the enemies on each level, helping you to choose the gear that will do the most damage to the toughest opponents.\n\nIf you get stuck (and you probably will) you can replay old levels to earn stars (which unlock more gear), and gold (which you can use to upgrade the gear you have).  It can feel a little grindy, especially at the beginning when there aren't many levels to go back and play so you end up playing the same levels 5 or 10 times to grind out gold.  The game is pretty good about generating different tile sets, though, so you'll be racing to come up with new words even on replays.\n\nDefinitely a fun game.", "recommendationid": "32972732", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513697", "timestamp_created": 1498710763, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 442, "playtime_forever": 129, "last_played": 1498710152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972221457"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495689605, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game.
