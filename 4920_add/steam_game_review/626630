I have not had any problems with this game at all. Starts good, graphics are excellent, controls are fluid, in other words it's great.There are some difficulties with both characters, Knight and Woodsman when it comes to weapons and their use. You are stuck with basic weapons and alternatives see you swinging like crazy to no effect while your health quickly circles the drain. The Woodsman has virtually no armor whatsoever and has to shoot and run, mainly run. I guess this will sort as the game progresses. Most comments are to the negative for TW II HD but you need to give them a chance, most seem to be concerned about everything else but the game.", "recommendationid": "33711338", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516941", "timestamp_created": 1500693420, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_forever": 2479, "last_played": 1506555010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561197990471408"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502000674, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 9, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "A fun dlc.
