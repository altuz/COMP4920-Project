Decent story and acting, well done in terms of art and style, logical inventory use throughout the game without it being too simple, and good puzzles. The HO scenes are all inventory-based (within the puzzle, not using your main inventory). There are a few achievements for a few of the puzzles, so you might want to check out the list before you start.", "recommendationid": "34072215", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506469", "timestamp_created": 1502067826, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 158, "playtime_forever": 448, "last_played": 1502067487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067612501"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
