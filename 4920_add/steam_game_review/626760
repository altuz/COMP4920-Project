Many times, the objects don't register properly so I find myself struggling to pick up a liquor bottle.\n\n-I wish there were a save button for career mode, since there's been more than one occasion it'll crash or I've accidently exited from the game and find that I have to restart the career mode from square one. Also, I can't seem to figure out if there's a menu button to go back to the main menu??\n\n-There's lack of ambiance and the music can be off-putting. I wish there were bar noises like glasses clinking, people conversating, and more upbeat music to get the bar mood going.\n\n-I have no clue how to unlock Arcade Mode and there seems to be no information in-game that I can find either.\n\n-I got to day 15 and found myself getting bored. I feel there's a lack of goals and there's too much wait time between customers, which take me out of the immersion.\n\n-A clock on the wall that indicates how far you are into the night would give a better sense of time instead of am I getting 3 customers tonight or am I getting 6?\n\n-Temporary upgrades to purchase during play like beer nuts to help calm down an angry customer or a special garnish for a drink to boost tips would be a great mechanic.", "recommendationid": "31552981", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517232", "timestamp_created": 1493960332, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 504, "playtime_forever": 120, "last_played": 1505441482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198063500766"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494029383, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I haven't played much of the game but from what I have done so far, I really like it.
