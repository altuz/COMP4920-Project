Given the age and the fact that widescreen wasn't a thing at that time the Steam release has a limited widescreen support up to 1776x1000 16:9. It doesn't look too bad you just have a black frame around your game screen at 1080p.\nDWC is an arcade racer and by no means a racing sim. I bought it for \u20ac1.24 because I'm a Ducati fan. Using ReShade 3.0.7 improves the image quality noticeably. I play it on Win10_64 compatibility set to WinXP_SP3.\nThere's not much to say about gameplay it will keep you entertained for a while. You can use kb/m or a controller - please use a controller.\nI don't understand why this game has so much bad reviews from people who didn't get the game to run. As I said the procedure to get DWC working is straightforward.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LQgr7_2DbA&t=11s\nI'll give it a 6/10 and you should only buy it when DWC is on sale."}]}
