The spell casting is extreamly easy to use but can be hard to master. For example I am able to split my fireball in 2 by casting the split spell, and I am able to make my fire balls heat seaking with the bolt spell. When I save up the mana to use the 2 spells together I can create 2 very hard to dodge fire balls, but if my opponent is good enough they can cast a slow time spell to stop them and dodge. This kind of gameplay creates really intense but fun battles that are good for all types of players.\n\nPROS:\n-Finding matches is quick and they let you practice on targets while you wait\n-The game looks super nice, and all animations are extreamly polished\n-the combat is super smoth to play, Spells have combinations that are fun to experiment with, and it takes a fair amount of skill to beat an opponent that knows what their doing\n-There is a very good tutorial on what every thing does that is also optinal for you to do\n-There are AI opponents that you can learn against\n-There is a boss mode where you fight a large boss (shown in video)\n-4 Different types of wizards to pick from and can be swapped before every match\n\nCONS\n-only a couple modes (but the game came out 2 days ago as of writing this and is in early access)\n-no way to find opponents of equal skill (as of right now)\n-finding an opponent can be a few minuts if playing at a bad time (early on weekdays)\n\nSo if your on the edge about getting this game for your Vr headset I would highly suggest that you pick it up, (Its only 15 bucks, less if got on sale, and most people buy games for 60)", "recommendationid": "33750161", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503927", "timestamp_created": 1500835010, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 177, "last_played": 1501016386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049281601"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500592725, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game!\n\nThe spellcasting is just challenging enough, and when combined with the dodging aspect, this game offers a good workout for both the mind and the body.\n\nSuper polished all the way through.\n\nMultiplayer was a blast.

Since this is early acess I would reccomend the developers to add more than just the standard 1v1 duel in PVP, either add some mini games PVP (for example hitting Npcs for points where you can interfere with the other players fireballs/iceballs etc), or a more complex PVP where each player has its own base and can upgrade it with mana over time and upgrade it during the duel (or just summon more dragons to help or even fire, frost, wind and earth elementals).\nFinally the boss offline mode could be turned into a Co-Op where each class could provide different buffs to each other (wind could give some speed to the fireballs for example) or a debuff to the boss (frost could slow,freeze the boss for a few seconds for example).\n\nOverall I think the game has potential but needs some polish and more content, since like i said before, it turns very repetitive and makes the player bored quickly.\n\n6.5/10 (If you are considering buying this read the whole review I'm a strict grader don't be fooled by numbers.)", "recommendationid": "33962344", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497825", "timestamp_created": 1501642301, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_forever": 59, "last_played": 1501697518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198159036345"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501278877, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Loving what I see so far.
