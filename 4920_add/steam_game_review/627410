Those are the good things.  \n\nAs for the bad - the game is entirely too chaotic.  You essentially fall down each level avoiding various enemies, traps, and other environmental hazards.  The controls (I used an Xbox One controller) didn't feel terribly responsive or at least not to a point I'd prefer.  My biggest gripe is I simply have no idea what's going on.  I don't mean story-wise either, though that's lacking in-game too.  Instead I'm talking about the various icons or artifacts you can pick up.  I had no clue what the vast majority of it did or how to use them correctly.  Instead I found myself just bumbling to the bottom of each level, occasionally shooting something out of my rear, going through some random portals and hoping I make it to the end.\n\nI realize this is a pretty negative review of this game and I can't really recommend it right now.  However, it does seem as if the developer is working hard on it and adding not only new content but trying to fix existing issues.  I'd gladly come back and try this title out again and see if it's been improved.  So there's definitely potential - just right now it's not fully reached.  \n\nMe bumbling around: https://youtu.be/jcMmx_GRzkg", "recommendationid": "34162265", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497971", "timestamp_created": 1502432845, "author": {"num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 169, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1502431575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025227359"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
