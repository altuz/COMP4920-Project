By examining what survival strategies work, and which ones don't, you can create more adapted, survivable organisms more likely to flourish. Unfortunately, the game makes achieving it's own goals difficult ENTIRELY through being opaque about data. \n\nGenetic traits are not explained. Some are obvious, some are not. Changing traits and observing differing outcomes between species is difficult, because you can't view an organism's traits after it's created and you can and often will lose them amongst other organisms, making gathering data impossible. Further, you can't track individual populations, so two near-identical looking populations coming into existence instantly means you are unable to observe the success of either group; they could both be flourishing, or one might have gone extinct immediately.\n\nThe end result is that simply spawning vast numbers of random organisms, and waiting the few minutes it takes for natural selection to choose succesful organisms is both faster and more efficient than attempting to make your own; making it a game that rewards you for not playing it.", "recommendationid": "35414738", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506949769, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 328, "playtime_forever": 91, "last_played": 1506947833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "steamid": "76561198034396876"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 56, "total_positive": 30, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
