Her reaction was a classic and I felt so damn good teaching her a lesson. Just wish you had the chance to do this to Brendan as the female, I would have loved to teach that jerk a nice little lesson. Don't like how pathetic the girl gets when she is in denial about him not giving a damn about her after he got into her pants. Don't really blame him for been real jerky about it later when sleeping with the gold digger, the girl was being rather creepy. She should have just been whatever and gone for someone better, like really. Then she is all jaded bout relationshps once she gets home. It's really quite pathetic. My favourite relationship was definately Danny's route, male or female it didn't matter, he was a great character, really well put together, one of the best I've seen in visual novel games and I've played a lot of those. I replayed his route a few times, though I leant more towards the M/M relationships, just wish people would have more of those in games, rather then overkilling with F/F relationships. I loved how you had so many options, people to choose from, they were all pretty decent and unique characters, but Danny was still the best. c:", "recommendationid": "34682353", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1504350428, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 79, "playtime_forever": 871, "last_played": 1506240754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198050760043"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500752034, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'm actually surprised this game has such mixed opinions? I actually loved it alot, no strong qualms, which is weird because I'm super stupid picky about my otomes man.\n\nI think most people can agree that western otomes have almost always had quality writing, but have always looked ugly as hell compared to Japanese otomes. THIS GAME THOUGH! No long am I looking at strange proportioned men, but handsome boys like Mark who's hair I REALLY wish I had. \n\nIf I could put some ok hand emojis here I would, but I don't know if steam allows that, and I'm too lazy to go, and copy paste any here. Point is, good game.\n\nIt's definitely a little reptitive at times, i click the skip ahead button though, and I'm shooting through the game with ease which is VERY GOOD cause oh boy if I had to spend 10 minutes pressing skip ahead to get my romance on I'd be whining about that for an hour, and maybe saying its not worth it (but mark is so worth it, c'mon, if ur gonna play for anyone play for Mark.)\n\nAn otome out rn that I think has some similarities to this game (meaning they'll prob attract near the same audience) would be Dream Daddy, except the main character in this game is more bubbly, and shy than the dream daddy mc. When the male characters cheeks rosey up everytime he smiles....

The art is passable, the music is a really poor choice, and the writing is the worst. All the characters suffer from how awful, inconsistent, choppy, and heavily cliched the writing is. It seems like they tried to make characters with \"real life flaws\" like being horribly sexist!  But, even if this was something to be tackled in a dating sim, which i don't really think it is, they do it very poorly. Your character can speak out, but it's always weakly and it doesnt have any satisfying impact. Everyone is unlikeable save for maybe two people. They handle the romances very poorly.  Honestly i've only played one route but I don't feel like i need to see any more because unless they did a complete 180 on their writing quality in any of the others, its not worth it. The conflict they do introduce is handled incredibly poorly. There's barely any choice, none of it feels meaningful, the relationships don't feel organic at all, which is honestly one of the most important parts of a game based on relationships. It's bad. It's really really bad. It's frustratingly bad because I normally really enjoy Hanako games, but this one was such a drop in quality. There are free games with better writing than this. Honestly, don't spend a dime, it's not worth it. Not even on sale. \n\nalso tbh, the only reason my playtime is so high is because it couldnt keep my interest and i kept my window open while i did other things. idiot move on my part because now i can't return it.", "recommendationid": "33422105", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507269", "timestamp_created": 1499661277, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_forever": 1016, "last_played": 1506816478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "steamid": "76561198255565602"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500273552, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Absolutely amazing.", "recommendationid": "33601901", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491168", "timestamp_created": 1500273552, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_forever": 308, "last_played": 1500369851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198188533971"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 9, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 32, "total_positive": 23, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
