In fact NOBODY is even there.\n\nIf you ask me why I'm buying this game, the concept of combining rpg and world war is very good. But this game is a dissapointment. Let me sum it up for you\n\nPros:\n-good concept\n\nCons:\n-game is kinda unfinished\n-character collision is badly implemented, I mean you can even go to the ceiling of a building by clicking it using your mouse\n-no tutorial\n-no journal to keep track of your progress\n-first battle against wolf is a pain in the ass. 1 shot from revolver did an average of 40-60 dmg while a single wolf bite can cause 60-84 dmg\n-the most annoying part is that after you kill the wolf, VUK is gone from the game. They should've named him FUCK\n\nNo, no, no, no.\nDon't buy it until they fix the issue", "recommendationid": "31638723", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528859", "timestamp_created": 1494299330, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 23, "last_played": 1494304554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198122683213"}, "votes_up": 20}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
