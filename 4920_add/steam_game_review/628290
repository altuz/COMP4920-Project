Worth at least following to keep an eye on development. But if you like turn-based strategy, it may be worth investing in now.\n\nSo, UPDATES!\n\nI'll be keeping (hopefully) a running review, as this game is very promising, and I hope the positive aspects only continue to improve. All that in mind, I'd like to get into some of the specifics, as my original review was very vague. \n\nAll Walls Must Fall utilizes a turn-based system, similar to XCOM and other games, but a lot simpler in execution. You can move, you can shoot, and you have a few \"special\" abilities. There are a total of four weapons in the game, three of which seem particularly viable.\n\nSomething the game does not seem to give proper warning about (or that I am missing) is that you cannot save progress in the middle of a campaign. Campaigns will auto-save, but there is no way to save a particular point. And what this means is, once your agent dies (After taking 3 shots), the campaign is over. This may be the intended function, so that the game is more rogue-like. It's a mechanic I've accepted after a while, but a frustrating one initially.\n\nOver the course of a campaign, the character can sustain a total of three shots, at least to the length I've played to. That's right -- the whole game, you can be shot three times. There are ways to circumvent being shot: During a mission, you have a counter of energy points which can be used to rewind a movement/action, but once the counter runs out, damage is unavoidable.\n\nHopefully these few paragraphs will give a description of some of the qualms with the game, so let me jump into a brief pros/cons section:\n\nPros:\n- Unique flow to turn-based gameplay\n- Many different ways to approach situations: Talking down guards, hacking drones, shooting a place up\n- Tells a narrative that is slightly-randomized each time\n- Pretty graphics and aesthetic. (May not be everyone's style, however)\n- Turn based, but utilizes an energy system which always runs down, encouraging quick movement and thinking \n- \"Badass\" feelings as you take on 7, 8, 9 times as many enemies as yourself\n\nCons:\n- Ability to end campaign after 3 mistakes means repeating same story beats\n- Some dialogue options do not seem properly translated/do not match with the NPC's line\n- Gameplay is very simple. Good at times, but other times feels as if it lacks depth\n- Only 4 weapons to choose from\n- Making money seems slow and somewhat inconsistent\n\nHopefully this overview helps some. I do really enjoy this game, but it's clear it's still in alpha (which isn't a problem) I just hope updates and improvements continue.\n\nSomething really nice is there is ALWAYS a forum to offer suggestions and praise to the developers, while playing. You simply press a button and can send a blurb containing something you \"wish\" and \"like\" about the game. The devs seem to care about improvement.", "recommendationid": "34109259", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549350", "timestamp_created": 1502216952, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 65, "playtime_forever": 169, "last_played": 1503787214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198284593295"}, "votes_up": 30}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502308807, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you were to take the turn-based combat of the XCOM series and then place it in an alternate history where the Berlin wall was never torn down and the Cold War still rages on, you'll end up with inbetweengame's All Walls Must Fall.\n\nHowever, unlike XCOM, the combat might be similar but this isn't squad based, its just you against several enemies, thus making combat rather intense. This can be somewhat cheesed though, by parking yourself by a doorway or similar cover then your opponents can be easily picked off, choosing to stand there for the most part as you gun them and their cohorts down. Another thing to remember, which I constantly forgot myself, is that you have to confirm each action before Kai acts it out, an option to disable this and set it to auto-confirm would be a neat addition.\n\nTaking place in the Berlin nightclub scene just a few hours before a nuke wipes it out, you play as STASIS agent Kai, who has been sent back in time to gather info on and either interrogate/assassinate key figures linked to the explosion, in an attempt to prevent it.\n\nAs a result of frequent time travel, some of the people you meet throughout the game are ones you previously killed under the organisation's orders, only to be sent back to interrogate them instead. This leads to paradoxes where Kai sometimes encounters people who know him from another timeline where he didn't kill them and this happens to be one of those timelines.\n\nTime travel is weird, thats all you need to know.\n\nAfter each mission is successfully completed, and to be honest, they are pretty short, you can choose to replay them for better scores and thus higher rewards. I quite enjoyed the short length of the missions, as I could do several in one session, whereas with the likes of XCOM just one mission could take an hour or more.\n\nConsidering that you can only take three hits before you die and don't have enough points to rewind, a good strategy is an absolute must when it comes to each fight. Thankfully the game gives you a heads up if there's an incoming hit during movement. With the right power you can rewind time but only for yourself, resetting enemy positions and health, or simply rewind your health among others, presumably with more to be added in the future.\n\nYou also have your standard weapons, shotguns, smgs, rifles etc to use, shotguns for close range and smg/rifle for mid to close range, as per usual. However I ended up sticking with the pistol and spending my cash on powers, which meant enemies took longer to kill but I could stun them with tap shots and manipulate time to an even greater extent.\n\nAt times you will be forced into conversation with a doorman or guard, with each option affecting how you succeed or fail, like for me during the second mission, I unintentionally seduced the target and got him to take me to a private room after deciding to seduce him a second time. The second time around however, I opted to scare him into giving me the info and shooting my way out of the club.\n\nAt the moment the game is only a third completed, as per the disclaimer you see when first playing. So yes, there is a good amount of content yet to be added but for fans of XCOM and the like, definitely worth getting, or waiting the 6-12 months that the devs have stated to be when it leaves early access. For now though, regular updates will be dropping every month or so.\n", "recommendationid": "34131992", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516318", "timestamp_created": 1502308807, "author": {"num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 891, "playtime_forever": 175, "last_played": 1502297074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055631052"}, "votes_up": 14}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502729823, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Played this game in alpha and I am really blown away by how finished it already feels now. i really dig how the music works with the turn based system and love the setting!
