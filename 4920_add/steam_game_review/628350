I had a good time! It was adequately spooky with some good looking enemies alone the way. The audio was my favorite aspect of this game as it made moments tense even when nothing was there. It left lots of questions unanswered, but I assume Chapter Two will clear things up.\n\n So far a good start to the series. \n\nLAZARETTO: Chapter One Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQExZ2b_9Kr7LohA5lhgTa-AMPlbC45cE", "recommendationid": "32054427", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502762", "timestamp_created": 1496112469, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 17, "playtime_forever": 279, "last_played": 1496101453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198255839295"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496024558, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 9, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hey all! This is going to be my first review on a Steam Horror game. First off let me introduce myself. My name is Richard aka (its xFlashx) and I would love to give out an awesome review about this game! I'll give it a 10/10 for it being an indie horror game. The Sound effects are scary and the puzzles actually take time to figure out instead of easily being solved! Don't be afraid to browse Youtube if you ever get stuck on a part in this game. It gets better and better. The beginning part of this game does take some time to figure out, I'll give you a clue to 2 parts I've noticed people getting stuck on *A Helping Spoiler* \"1. put the broken mask pieces in the box, 2. where you see lots of doors with a death bed, pull out the bed and jump on top key on a ceiling pipe\". Don't give up if you don't figure out the puzzle because the game gets REAL good later on ;). Its most definitely worth the price of what the developers are asking for. Turn up that volume and be in for amazing scares to get you jumping off your seat :D Enjoy! \\m/ - twitter @itsxflashx", "recommendationid": "32033359", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488993", "timestamp_created": 1496024558, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 177, "last_played": 1495661258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198199660414"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495458324, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 12, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "https://youtu.be/tfejCkIragM\n\nNo. \n\nThis game uses the same asset hospital as \"Horror Hospital\", a turkish game that i got laughed at for saying \"ahhh, it's alright for the price\" (in Turkish, no less). This is basically a walking simulator, with lots of sounds going on around you tha thave noeffect on your game play what soever. It took me 50 minutes or so to find something that might kill me, and i found the whole experience rather underwhelming. \n\nwalking for a long time is not gameplay, when will indie devs realise this? Hiding keys around the long walk in order to impede your journey doesn't make more fun. In fact, that's what this game lacks more than anything else...fun. \n\nSorry Devs...waste of money, unless you like walking in the dark a lot. \n", "recommendationid": "31900600", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500038", "timestamp_created": 1495458324, "author": {"num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_forever": 58, "last_played": 1495324726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005244416"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495442572, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 11, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So far the game is quite good.  The game has a twist on how you encounter hostile mobs which could lead to intense moments of panic.

I cant wait for chapter 2 i give it 8.5 out of 10.  Custom controls would be great and when hiding or ridding something the mouse becomes very sensitive and jitters around.

I've only played for about an hour and I'm absolutely terrified to go upstairs in the hospital. You hear noises, and you see things... You know you're not alone... It is so suspensful walking through the maps with just enough light to see wondering if something is going to be around the corner. I am scared to keep playing, but I really want to see what happens next. It's such an internal struggle. The sounds and visual affects within this game are amazing and from a game developer, I really like how much thought and planning went into the code to make this game come together. I recommend purchasing this game. With a price as low as this, you really can't go wrong and be upset with buying a game like this! Don't hesitate, trust me, and do it!
