Character movement feels unnatural.\n-Level design is poor, some obstacles are placed badly and overall feels mediocre\n-Soundtrack is really annoyingk, especially after the first 30min.\n\nOverall, there are many better platformers for the same price that you can pick up. Avoid this game.\n3/10\n\n[code][h1]Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nFree Games? Reviews? Competitions? Amazing Community?
