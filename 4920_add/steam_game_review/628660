It had bombs and other tools, and teleporters. It made the levels more interesting and puzzle more elaborate than simply figuring out which blocks to zap in what order. Also had different worlds with different aesthetics.\n\nI would recommend this game if you want a voxel-based iteration of basic Lode Runner. It will likely give you short spurts of fun. I don't think this game can be played for long periods of time and remain fun.\nThere is a 50 level adventure mode, 50 level puzzle mode (with leaderboards), and you can play player-made levels. The player made levels will probably be the source of most fun. I am disappointed with the lack of bombs, such as were in the Sierra version of the game, and how deaths look in general. Dying is almost like in Super Mario where he has a \"ouch\" frame before the screen cuts out, but that \"ouch\" frame is the only thing you get, nothing else. The death animation in this game feels like they took the lazy route.\n\nFor pricing, I would not have gotten the game at the current price of $15.99 if I knew bombs weren't in the game. With the perceived level of content I see, I would pay between $5 to $8.\n\nIf you can get the 1994 Sierra Lode Runner: The Legend Returns, I would personally stick with that one, as I feel there is more to enjoy there. If you want leaderboards and simple gameplay with a little puzzling challenge (but not as much as it could have been) then feel free to pick this up.", "recommendationid": "33509293", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566490", "timestamp_created": 1499971256, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 297, "playtime_forever": 46, "last_played": 1499970442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021887339"}, "votes_up": 34}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500035038, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "#Early Review - Adventure Mode - 22% / Classic - 3%\n\nLoads of fun - with a few complaints.\n\nPros\n- TONS of content. A full adventure mode and classic mode\n- I like the art style. Very 3D Dot Heroes.  Wouldnt have minded the 360 version art either. But hey, Not complaining.\n- A good challenge\n- Its fun!\n- Make your own levels, characters, and items and download those from others.\n----_Slight con here: There doesnt seem to be a menu to select WHICH downloaded treasure, etc to use? Unless I am missing something.\n\nCons\n- With a controller connected, there is no way to navigate the menu with a mouse. WHY.\n- Only 2 resolution settings and both are terrible on my monitor.\n- Building is a fantastic idea, but the tools available are so barebones it hurts. More specifically:\n----- You cant just paint an existing block, You can only add and delete. Which makes no sense.\n----- There isnt any way to make the brush bigger or smaller.", "recommendationid": "33528019", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512935", "timestamp_created": 1500005747, "author": {"num_reviews": 175, "num_games_owned": 893, "playtime_forever": 134, "last_played": 1505060911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972584572"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499977315, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "If you're old enough to remember the original Lode Runner back when you were a kid, just go ahead and buy it for nostalgic reasons.

Did you like it?  If so, you can stop reading now and just go ahead and buy the game now.  The entire classic set of 150 levels are included and this is pretty much a perfect update to those levels.  The graphics are significantly improved while retaining a retro/pixel-art feel.  In addition, all the timing on the levels is retained, too.  \n\nIn addition to that, there are plenty of new modes with different graphics and options that are also nice updates.  And there's a 1st person perspective that you can play, too.  The graphics on the new modes are super-nice, too.  And, a staple of all Lode Runner games, a great level editor.  Mix in leaderboards, community levels you can download, and you're looking at a loaded update that is truly an example of how to \"remake\" a retro game and do it right.\n\nThe game isn't perfect - the controls in the menus are a little wonky - but the gameplay is perfect and the game is a tremendous value.

I loved pretty much anything from the old Broderbund catelogue, and have been hoping Steam would bring some ports of those games onto their platform for years. When I saw this game, I didn't hesitate to purchase.\n\nUnlike the recent \"Choplifter\" remake, this game actually manages to capture the spirit of the original. This review will not cover the modern \"remake\" part of the game, so if you're interested in that, read another review. I personally am only interested in the \"classic mode\", and since that's the only mode I've played, that's the only mode I'll be covering in this review.\n\nThe classic mode gameplay is pretty faithful to the original game. They've inserted some unnessecary 3D graphics effects to appeal to the youngsters, but other than that, the level design and gameplay is satisfying.\nYou control your \"runner\" solve puzles, outsmart your persuers, and collect all the tresure on the map to advance to the next level. Just like you remember.\n\nGameplay is fast paced, the puzzles are simple, yet some can be challanging, and the controls and mechanics are easy to pick up.\n\nOverall I would reccomend this game to all of you who remember playing it as a kid. While they've added unnessasary graphics effects, the core gameplay, and level design is exactly what you remember. As far as the non-classic remake mode goes, well... I'll leave that for the youngsters to review. I'm perfectly happy with the game as it was 30 years ago.", "recommendationid": "33607060", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496968", "timestamp_created": 1500295292, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 425, "playtime_forever": 254, "last_played": 1501930493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018712600"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "total_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 9, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
