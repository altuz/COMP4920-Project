You choose one of (at the moment) 3 unique characters, each with their own unique playstyle. The game is set like a mature version of Dungeon Defenders or Orcs Must Die, where you set up your defenses \nhowever you deem fit, leaving a huge potential for min/maxing optimal defense via location, choke points, certain set ups, etc.\n\nYou start out at level 1 with one of the characters, being able to level up perks when you hit a certain level. In-game you can also have mini level-ups called talent ups to further individualize gameplay style, such as increase HP, or increase damage, which reset upon the end of the game. It looks like the gameplay is leaning heavily towards multiplayer so I'd assume it's MUCH more fun with friends.\n\nI realize this is an Early Access game, and I'm looking forward to this game's future as it has so much potential to be an amazing game. It's already ridiculously addictive, and so far I've only played 1 game with another player (I've done a few games solo). Dev's are quick to respond and are constantly updating the game, making this game's future very bright. At the moment, I started the game at 7/22/17 which would be during Patch 0.4.\n\nPros:\n+ Easy learning curve\n+ Great concept\n+ Fun and extremely addicting\n\nCons:\n- Needs more characters\n- Fluidity for jumping is not very smooth, little details such as characters waiting around the game lobby have parts of their body clipping through the ground\n- Needs an option to be able to join during a game, many players just simply start the game because no one at the EXACT moment of game lobby creation will wait around for people who may possibly jump online and find a match - this deters players from playing and enjoying the game to the full potential\n- Game is connected via client side host, so lag issues persist\n\n\nTL;DR:\n8/10\n3rd person action-defense styled after Dungeon Defenders/Orcs Must Die but in a more mature way. Extremely addicting tower defense-esque game in which you plot strategic defensive placements while you control one of a handful of unique characters with their own playstyle. Early Access still but has a lot of potential to be great.\n\n\nWill keep updating my review as the patches roll in.\n\n7/22/17 Patch 0.4:\nSo far the only \"complaint\" I have, is the way joining games are handled. If under the \"Ping\" column it says \"Game Started\" you just can't join, at all. Though the dev's have said they are working to implement a way to join these games.", "recommendationid": "33738301", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1500795063, "author": {"num_reviews": 72, "num_games_owned": 343, "playtime_forever": 147, "last_played": 1500831465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000544100"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500075751, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First of all let me say that even though I \"recommend this game\" I do not urge anyone to buy it. It is an Early Access game and currently there aren't many players around and I doubt it will generate more ( as with many EA games ). \n\nNow onto the review. \n\nIt is a weird game. It feels like a stable beta BUT it needs A LOT of polish. From Hit detection / sounds / animations melee combat and enemy reactions / death animations ETC. It needs a LOT of work. It is playable as it is now and its quite enjoyable but only if you have friends to play it with. It seems like difficulty does not adjust to 1 Player. \n\nPersonally it gives me Kingdom Under Fire Circle of Doom vibe. Except combat mechanics are shallow and does not have proper hit detection / animations / sounds as I have mentioned before. It feels like you are swinging a stick with no resistance to flesh and bone which is a let down for me. No blood splatter etc. Bottom line : Needs more polish! / updates.\n\nI got this game because I got hooked up on Dungeon Defenders. However I hate aestetics of DD. \nThis game is more mature visually and I personally like it. There is enough perks to choose from and even skills after each wave you can choose ( those are lost after the match but Perks stay with a character. ) Strategy mechanics are... simple however I would appreciate some sort of manual so you can read about the defensive units ( str and weaknesess ). Enemies seem to pass one another or clutter I would appreciate if they had walk in line :P so you can see properly when they attack. A lot of games in this genre suffer from these issues. Gameplay as in melee / shooting mechanics are arcady' and unprecise. Coming from Dark Souls this feels really weak. \n\nI do hope they improve on UI and GFX a bit. There is this blur all over the place and I can't seem to change it ;/ I want my games crisp / sharp : ) Also I wish they had implemented zoom / zoom out from a character and Map Overview. \n\nThere is enough maps for EA and currently only 3 characters to choose from. Game didn't crash even once and it seems online matchmaking works well ( albeit I haven't had a chance to find a lobby and test for lag ). Give it 6 - 12 months and if they do polish it up I would recommend to give it a try.", "recommendationid": "33547406", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1500075751, "author": {"num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 355, "playtime_forever": 58, "last_played": 1501800725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017418708"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500219252, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "if all orcs must die was a solid beta that was set in the dark souls/bloodborne universe you would get this game. right now it still feels like the early access that it is. looking forward to seeing how it develops", "recommendationid": "33587530", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499292", "timestamp_created": 1500219252, "author": {"num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 350, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1500160765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198093696020"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 29, "total_positive": 27, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
