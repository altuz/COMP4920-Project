I can't find anything bad to say about this game.\nThe menu is simple, you can quit the game by just pressing ESC on the menu, it shuts down and starts up fast and the song playing on the background is okay.\n\nBought it for 50 cents and it's surprisingly good for such a cheap game. It has 3 types of mazes which each have 20 levels (so that's 60 levels in total). The maze types are circle, delta and hexagon. Even though the game can be completed in under an hour including getting all the achievements. But for the price tag it has, the game is great!", "recommendationid": "35444347", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502531", "timestamp_created": 1507035099, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 100, "playtime_forever": 7, "last_played": 1507034776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "steamid": "76561198065573801"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506635963, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Bought this game purelly because I was bored.\nLet's put all the aspects \"on the shelfs\".\n\n[b] Pros\t[/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*] This game is cheap\n    [*] Wastes time\n    [*] Gives cards \n[/list]\n[b] Cons [/b]\nThere's more cons that pros, but that doesn't make the game bad.\n[list]\n    [*] Lack of options.
