Until this is fixed the game cannot be considered a proper RPG as it forces you to be female and to wear female outfits (though the thought of Barry in a dress is a tad funny). RPGs are meant to promote choice and customisation.\n\nWhen I role play I tend to prefer doing so as the sex I was born. The game is updated a LOT, but this never seems to be added. \n\nI see malicious people commenting on the discussion boards that if you are a man and have to role play as a man, then YOU have 'issues.' Perhaps these people need to check what the definition of role play is. If men wanting to play men have 'issues', is it not then fair to say that men wanting to be women are equally, if not more troubled? People have their own preferences.\n\nI bought the game almost three months ago. I want to play it, but not as a woman. I'm a man who prefers to be a man. When I play RPGs its because I (me, the man) want to escape into a fantasy, not that I want to do so whilst 'role playing' as a female. I've had to request a refund, sorry. I make male characters on WoW, Dark Souls, Terraria, Project Zomboid, it's my preference when I play any game as an RPG experience. I pretty much only play RPGs and it's how I like to RP.\n\nSome people like dressing up as animals and having furry parties. Some guys pretend to be girl gamers or openly play female characters as male gamers. Me, I just want to escape into a fantasy world as myself, as my sex, representing my own personal exploration of the game world. Each to their own, as they say.\n\nIf the game was tagged appropriately with 'female protagonist' then I wouldn't have bought it, at least not until male PCs were available. Sorry. I'd be happy to repurchase when this is fixed and would naturally remove this negative review (assuming of course I liked the game).", "recommendationid": "35307206", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430989", "timestamp_created": 1506708671, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 587, "playtime_forever": 7, "last_played": 1506708455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198036725485"}, "votes_up": 7}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "total_reviews": 60, "total_positive": 53, "review_score": 8}, "success": 1}
