Now they glow a bright red, maybe it impacts the carefully planned aestethic that the author was going for but for the gameplay is a huge boon.\n2) Shooting rate has been slightly improved, so you don't have to wait half a second waiting your three whiffed shots to go offscreen to resume blasting. The game is still difficult as it is and I think it's been retooled to account for that (some places on the first world have three turrets where I remembered only two but I might be misremembering)\n3) Controls are a tiny bit more precise than I remember.\n\nBuy it!", "recommendationid": "35163091", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513050", "timestamp_created": 1506198204, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 441, "playtime_forever": 265, "last_played": 1506371892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 265, "steamid": "76561198027103234"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506148427, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Super cool gradius-inspired hori shmup.

It clearly takes heavy inspiration from games like Gradius, but while feeling modern and polished.\n\nIf you have experience with Gradius and liked it, you'll definitely like this. (I personally find it much better and far less frustrating than Gradius.)\n\nIf you don't have experience with games like Gradius but ya like shmups, this can still very well be quite appealing for you.\n\nSo, onto some basic things the game has:\n\nYour GUNS. You have various weapons at your disposal, specifcally: A Main weapon, a secondary weapon (like mines that shoot below you) and a bomb or active weapon that you get charges to use via a certain powerup. Most levels gives a new weapon unlock upon completion to add to what you can choose from. This can lead to some unique loadouts and even some neat synergies.\n\nPOWERUPS. There aren't many, which is fine for a game like this. There are little green orbs and red orbs you'll come across often. When you max out on either your fire power/fire rate will improve. Then there are the main big \"3\" power ups that you kill special enemies to get. This powerup, when dropped, alternates between a shield, an active weapon use, and speed/mobility upgrade. \n\nUsually, you want to get a shield if you lack one as it protects you from a hit before dying, and then go for the other two. You can have a total of three active weapon charges and the same goes with the speed upgrades. And when you die you lose some of all your power ups.\n\nLEVELS. The levels (from what I've done so far) are very well made and even hold some secrets. They all feel fair and I never felt a death wasn't my fault. Every boss is significantly different from the others and the pacing of the game is very nice as is the difficulty curve. \n\nThere are a lot of levels as well. This is an obvious gud thing. And as it says in the features list, the order of what levels you go through are non-linear! There are some branching paths in the level select screen so you can go through one set of levels or the other. There are also some \"special\" levels which are designed to be extra difficult but also reward a neat item.\n\nAN OBLIGATORY CONCLUSION.\n\nThey set out to make a modern Gradius and succeeded in every aspect. It's difficult but fair, and is one of the best shmups ever made I'd say. Heck, I'd say it's easily THE best I've ever played if we're talking horizontal shmups.\n\nAnd it's worth mentioning that the art style is perfect for capturing the retro look in a crisp, clean way. The soundtrack is also well done and fits perfectly with the game.\n\nSo yeah, it's good. I reccomend it. I enjoy it. Thumbs up.
