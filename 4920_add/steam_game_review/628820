It is cool little party game for kids, except for annoying problems. At first the game would not respond to touch controllers at all. After 2nd time all of a sudden it started to work.\nScreen with inputs, is absolutely ridiculous!! Why aren't the inputs grouped into players? As in Player 1 edit inputs, Player 2 edit input. It's a bloddy mish-mash! You only pretty much use 2 buttons in the game but you can setup 7!! Why??? First is something that seem to be a keyboard but you can accidentally assign joystick to the buttons, because it's a mess! I have no clue which one is supposed to be A or B because they go: Fire 1, Fire 2, Fire 3, Jump, Submit, Submit, Cancel! What? Why?? What is what? Then it actually gets worse! I see the following in the input menu:\nJoy_X_1\nJoy_X_2\nJoy_X_3\nJoy_Y_1\nJoy_Y_2\nJoy_Y_3\nJoy_X_4\nJoy_Y_4\nJoy_X_5\nJoy_Y_5\nJoy_R2_1\nJoy_R2_2\nJoy_R2_3\nJoy_R2_4\nJoy_R2_5\n\nWTF is this??\nWhere does it end and where does it start for each player! How difficult is it to set this up logically!? I mean they can program whole game, but can't put together some kind of logical key input method???? Mind boggling!\nThen in Oculs Rift at least, if you press wrong button, menu disappears and you have to restart the game because I can't get out of that screen no matter which button I push!!\nOculus Rift requires pushing in thumbstick in order to move left and right in the menu, why? There is no need for that. Let me just move it left and right, that should be sufficient!\nFix it and I'll edit my review to a positive one.", "recommendationid": "32965091", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1498694794, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 79, "last_played": 1501119352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198028604749"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495450615, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "After playing this game with two of my best friends, I now realize that I'll no longer trust them anymore!!!\n\nTotally a Friend Filter Simulator\n\nCould be used to test your fragile friendship (if you got any friend...\n\n12/10", "recommendationid": "31899032", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499181", "timestamp_created": 1495450615, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 29472, "last_played": 1499887226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198388425006"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
