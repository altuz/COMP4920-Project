You build cities, you get points, player with the most points win. However, this games strength is the complete lack of dice rolls and RNG that enhances the skill cap rather than hampers it.\n\nFor instance:\nIn Settlers of Catan, you can get absolutely screwed and play a game where the diceroll never lands on the resource you need.\nIn Terra Mystica, however, you don't have those streaks of bad luck. Resources are determined by your buildings. Everything you do is left entirely up to you, meaning there is no sense of getting screwed by RNG that you ocassionally find in similar games.\n\nHowever, the game is incredibly complicated with 5 or 6 separte layers that all need detailed explaination and the game does a pretty poor job of explaining it to you. Hell, I still don't understand how the 3 power pools work. But after a few rounds most of the game should make sense.\n\n\nGet this game if:\n[list]\n    [*]You don't mind one of the worst and most frustrating UIs you've ever seen.\n    [*]Learning the games incredibly complex mechanics by trial and error.\n    [*]Have friends to play it with who enjoy deep strategy.\n[/list]\n\nAvoid it if:\n[list]\n    [*]This is your first deep strategy board game.\n    [*]You don't want to sink multiple rounds just to figure out how to play.\n    [*]You're just planning to play against the AI.\n[/list]\n\nI, personally, love it and my girlfriend and I have a blast trying to come up with cool strategies but the actual polish on this game is very, very poor.", "recommendationid": "35427881", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506976003, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 402, "playtime_forever": 464, "last_played": 1506222606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "steamid": "76561197997741625"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 40, "total_positive": 22, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
