The only short comings to this game is there aren't many choices throughout the game, and in total it is a short story. It took me roughly 3 hours to finish the entire story. I have only completed 1 out of 5 endings so far, but am interested to finish the rest. However I loved the ending that I receieved, so its gonna be hard to top it. \n\nPros:\nGood story, plotline, and character development\nGood game at the price\nUsually discounted when sale is going on\nMy opinion Great art\n\nCons: \nShort story\nWish there was a second game\nNot many story choices\n\nAlso to add to this, there is a (+18) explicit patch that makes the game a bit more interesting. When you open the game, bottom right corner will be where you can download and apply. Best thing to do is apply to open File Explorer to the game, then go to download it. Once there it will download the patch, remove the patch from the downloaded file and add it where all the RPA files. \n\nAll in all ill give this game a 6-7 out of 10 and Highly Recommend because I'm a sucker for love stories.", "recommendationid": "35366692", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500128", "timestamp_created": 1506840433, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_forever": 202, "last_played": 1506820490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 202, "steamid": "76561198392335157"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506454945, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "the girls are cute and the artstyle is nice. the uncensor patch is great :3. i would like a 2nd game with this developer and artist. would been great to have a wider choice of romantic interests than just 2.\n\nI like Chris, and didn't care for Sophie, since with a name like tomboys i wanted to get with the short hair cuties.", "recommendationid": "35228909", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491498", "timestamp_created": 1506454945, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 1365, "playtime_forever": 9, "last_played": 1506454531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "steamid": "76561197990272586"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506245193, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "linear and too expensive for what it has to offer.\n\nempty steam wallet/10", "recommendationid": "35175612", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493942", "timestamp_created": 1506245193, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 307, "last_played": 1501089609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198301675526"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "total_reviews": 53, "total_positive": 46, "review_score": 8}, "success": 1}
