It's a short psychological story, not much more, and certainly not a game that consists of many options. I would love to see the creators of this game expand it significantly in options and storyline; then it would certainly be a fun story worth playing.", "recommendationid": "35057326", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499397", "timestamp_created": 1505792419, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 54, "last_played": 1505792161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026999897"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 34, "total_positive": 32, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
