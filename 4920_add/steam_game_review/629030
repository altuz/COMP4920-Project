Your job is simple: clean up a mess left behind. Why? How? None of these questions are answered.\n\nThere is one plus point to the game and that's that it runs fast. Bad news? Uh... pretty much everything else. This is a poor man's Viscera Cleanup Detail and to even compare it to that feels weird. At least Viscera Cleanup Detail was fun while you were cleaning various locations! This... clean a few rooms and a few low quality blood decals.\n\nThe music and sounds are good so I suppose that's another plus point. But plus points are few and far between in a game... wait did I say game? There's really not enough substance here to warrant the title of 'game'.\n\nThe premise could have been something interesting: the only surviving employee of a facility has to find out what happened to their coworkers while cleaning up the messes and discovering a terrible truth. But the execution is honestly terrible.\n\nAt least I only paid \u00a30.08 for it with a coupon so that's nice at least.\n\nEmployee Recycling Center? More like Achievement Farming Center.\n\nI personally couldn't recommend this at all. Even at \u00a30.79 there isn't enough substance to justify paying that.
