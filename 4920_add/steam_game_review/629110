The Dark Parables just gets better as the story progresses through the series.  A 12 out of 10!\n\nPros:\n  Beautiful graphics that are a total pleasure. \n  Plenty of lovely Hidden Object Puzzles to search\n  There are several puzzles that come up, but they are not too difficult. \n  Story is good.\n  Voice acting is fine.  \n  Map is good and shows a view of the site\n  MULTIPLE ENDINGS!  Just finished a second play-through - and got a different ending than the first.\n\nCons:\n  No fast travel, but not too bad as you only go back a couple of rooms as a rule.\n  Sometimes the direction on the map seems different from the site - but then the image does help.\n\nAll in all the best so far of the series.  As I said at the beginning - they just get better and better. If you like Hidden Objects and really care about a quality game you will enjoy this one. \n", "recommendationid": "34133016", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "timestamp_created": 1502312387, "author": {"num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 677, "last_played": 1502394087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198033102868"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
