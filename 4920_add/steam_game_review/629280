Yes, an achievement hunting game with broken achievements. Let\u2019s just have a round of applause for the developers here. The \u201cawesome background music\u201d feature on the Steam page is subpar and horrible and I ended up muting my laptop and putting earphones in, jamming to my own music. Luckily, I didn\u2019t have to actually look at this game long enough to even get through the majority of the horrendously boring story line \u2013 it can sit on a black screen and get all your achievements for you.\n\nTruth be told, I only got this to rank on True Steam Achievements \u2013 if you sign up because of this review, please put \u201ctransyo\u201d in the user who referred you section, thanks \u2013 and even that makes this a waste of \u00a33.99. I highly regret spending \u00a34 on this game, heck I could have bought two or three subpar games with an interesting plot and decent soundtrack and stories.\n\nMistakes were made.
