I got the key to the inventory room but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to use it! The interact \"e\" key and left mouse click do not work for me. When you walk it has this wobbly affect which made me dizzy right away. If you just tap forward a little, you wobble like you're drunk! There are some scares but unfortunately I can't keep playing this game.
