Amidst the backdrop of a massive fear and dislike of each other between humans and Birdlings after a war which left only Bimonia and her mother Lulululu as the last Birdlings alive and living near human habitation together with multiple grey shades of morality among humans and Birdlings, Tayo and Bimonia's friendship and survival will be put to the test in this thriller and horror visual novel over 21 chapters as Tayo and Bimonia grow up to adulthood and reach different phases of their lives.\n\nThe game has plenty of save slots to allow different gameplay choices to be made during the game, with popup icons of a red/green feather and a portrait of Bimonia/Tayo to help players reach all the 5 possible endings where the number of red and green feathers required to reach each ending will be shown. Soundtracks, artwork and overall game presentation are good. Recommended with soundtrack and artbook DLC when at discount or bundle offer as it takes less than 10 hours to reach all endings.\n\n(Also recommended to download and finish the demo version of this game before buying this game and adding to library for an additional easy to finish 100% completed game)", "recommendationid": "34777464", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565442", "timestamp_created": 1504711248, "author": {"num_reviews": 91, "num_games_owned": 2216, "playtime_forever": 165, "last_played": 1504615135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006413390"}, "votes_up": 32}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505028231, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A fun visual game, interesting story with quite a few decision points. \n\nCan or will friendship overcome the history of their races \n\nFor you to decide how the journey could go. \nThe outcome at the end depending on choices made during the game.\n\nIt is a short game but I'm certainly glad I played it.\nI also really liked the music tracks which did emphasise the story.", "recommendationid": "34855359", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537626", "timestamp_created": 1505028231, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 132, "playtime_forever": 1012, "last_played": 1504946649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038114231"}, "votes_up": 18}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504993647, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I hardly write reviews but this game really needs some promotion and can't go left unsaid. The story starts sweet as they are young and exploring but soon throws you into choices that leave you thinking. I won't go into further detail as you should go in as blind as possible. \n\nThe different endings depending on your choice are nicely fleshed out, worth to go through them. Certainly some of them threw a curveball, which was a pleasant surprise. My first playthrough was about 6 hours long, I think I'm a medium speed reader, and I finished the other endings in another 2 hours. You can skip the text automatically if you've already are familiar with the lines and it will stop whenever you stumble upon unread lines. Also the skip speed is really nice.\n\nEven if this Visual Novel isn't voiced the music is very ambient and amazingly fitting to every scene. What I found a nice little touch that whenever a part played out in the rain it would have rain sound for a few second and then it would diminish, which didn't leave you with constant repeating rain noise in the background. It was enough to get my attention to \"hey, rain\" and then not bother me anymore through repeat. It's appreciated they made the effort in little noises to create more immersion.\n\nI would highly recommend this Visual Novel to friends. Maybe not to people who are starting out with Visual Novels as it deals with heavy themes and absolutely don't sugar coat them. (Which I highly appreciate, too little VNs of this caliber story.) Absolutely worth my money I enjoyed playing through it.", "recommendationid": "34847468", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_created": 1504993647, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 120, "playtime_forever": 483, "last_played": 1504992027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198061507335"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505251174, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a wonderful Visual Novel. The art is adorable and the music is stunning! I love music with oriental themes to it and they fit the style of the novel completely. \n\nI wasn't expecting to become so attached to Bibi and Yoyo and I'm not going to lie, I shed some tears... quite a few. It's difficult for a VN to make me cry and Katawa Shoujo has been the only one to succeed up until now. \n\nI reccomend this game, 100%. It has a touching story of two races at war and the children that get caught up in the traditions and ancient beliefs of the adults. The style this is done in as wonderful and I am in love with those two cuties. \n\nChoices are also good and relitvely frequent with a nice UI to boot. 9/10 ~ because there's always room to grow ;w;", "recommendationid": "34908729", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505251174, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 301, "last_played": 1506001321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "steamid": "76561198203076558"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505948684, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "So this was quite the interesting experience; it's very pleasant to start, with the attractive art (and the two artists' work really does mesh together beautifully) illustrating the early stages of a chance encounter between two girls, and then how their lives unfold over time.  There are several - many! - surprisingly dark moments, with characters and emotions that feel real. While I'd never pretend to be some all-knowing reader who can spot every potential twist coming a mile off, the story did catch me completely off guard with a twist that I didn't see coming more than once.\n\nThe whole thing feels very polished and professional; the UI design works well, and the sound and music do a good job of helping set the scenes too.\n\nMechanically it's interesting too, with twenty-one choices through a linear path, and five endings which are dependent on the choices you took - but the game is quite open with the progress screen showing you which levels of affection will result in which endings.  Means you can fully and easily (with a little thought) explore the tale yourself, without needing to rely on a third-party walkthrough.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice, fluffy, pick-me-up sort of tale, I have to be honest - this is probably not what you seek.\n\nBut if you've a mood to read something that's well thought through, well put together, and with challenging moments and dark twists - grab yourself a copy.\n\nRecommended.\n\n(My read time shows as relatively low, because I mostly read it on a Windows tablet that was offline, thus not clocking up the hours - but I have completely read the whole thing!)", "recommendationid": "35093511", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "timestamp_created": 1505948632, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 197, "playtime_forever": 108, "last_played": 1505946700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019363416"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 13, "total_positive": 13, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
