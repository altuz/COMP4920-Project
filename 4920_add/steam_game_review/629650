Usually, the protagonist arrive, meets some really cute heroines (with some busty heroine, panty shot), do 2-3 scenes, fall in love and succeed as a couple/musician... and live happily ever after. \n\nBut, here, there is no busty heroine, no panty shot, just \"real\" charachter with their own ambition. \n\nThe \"drama\" of each story does not feel forced... because they are justified. There is also no miracle to save the day at the end. And most of the \"good\" ending are nearly not as \"good\" as you might expect from playing other game. But that makes it more realistic. \n\nAt first, following Chris on at least 45 days (for each route), seems like it might not be that much interesting. But, soon, you get used to its daily routine, new heroine come up, choiche have to be made... and in the end, you did not have the time to feel bored. \n\nI honestly enjoyed this game. There is no drama over the top. There is no miracle. There is just people doing the choiche they think are the best... and consequences to face.  \n\nPS : this game made me sad when I realized I would never have a cute musical fairy helping me praticing... I'm sure I could have become a professional musician with Phorny at my side :) \n\n", "recommendationid": "34303105", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506142", "timestamp_created": 1502960674, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 311, "playtime_forever": 1414, "last_played": 1502917524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006962988"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502430757, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A good visual novel with extremely good music.

This was the \"good ending\" and it ended with inexplicable angst; there didn't really seem to be any reason why it ended that way other than as a middle finger to the reader. The character's reasoning is deliberately left unexplained to the reader.\n\nI researched a bit and apparently only one ending is actually positive and it's not one of the three available to you at the beginning. I can handle a bit of angst but not when it's just there for the sake of having angst. Supposedly a lot of people liked this VN; more power to them I guess, but I really don't get what they see in it. I have trouble saying it's bad given the overwhelmingly positive response others have had, but I will say that I personally didn't like it and don't get why other people do. My advice is to research it a bit before you consider buying.", "recommendationid": "33756258", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476920", "timestamp_created": 1500857761, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 519, "playtime_forever": 506, "last_played": 1500856651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990167963"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 16, "total_positive": 15, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
