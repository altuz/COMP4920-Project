If you are a fan of first person dungeon crawlers, you're already able to tell the game is great. Go get it now and have an awesome time bashing robot spiders with a crowbar!\n\nEDIT After several hours of playing:\nThe game started strongly and continues being fun several hours in.\nFor my playing tastes, it is even better than Grimrock. Why?\n\n- The setting is very atmospheric and original (compared to the standard, Dungeon Master-style fantasy setting of other crawlers).  Now I like fantasy just as much as the average crawler, however it's refreshing to have a change of scenery for once, especially if it's as well done as here.\n- The combat is really challenging and tactical. Every single enemy I encountered so far (about 8) has to be approached in a different way. No silly square dancing, every enemy and enemy group has to be outsmarted in order to win. Because of that, winning even against the smaller enemies feels very satisfying.\n- I also like having only one character (I like the crawling aspect, not the party management). Despite my initial worries, you can still customize him very well and he's able to fill out different roles on the fly depending on which weapons, armor or gadgets (= \"magic\" like aoe lightning attacks, acid pools etc) you use.\nAlso, being able to switch weapons sets in combat is genius. Hit the enemy, dodge it's attack, switch to rifle and shoot it, go in, switch to weapon and smash it again before finishing it off with lightning. Works very fluidly and feels really, really satisfying.", "recommendationid": "35279120", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492682", "timestamp_created": 1506649792, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 414, "playtime_forever": 787, "last_played": 1506909887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 787, "steamid": "76561198030651302"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507092254, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "After recently beating Legend of Grimrock II for the first time, I immediately regained my appetite for another FPRPG dungeon-crawl the very same day Vaporum released. I had never even seen the game listed on Steam anywhere nor had it reccomended, but it looked to be right up my alley, not to mention that it seemed to offer just enough tweaks and changes to set it apart. \n\nSurprisingly there is a shortage of steampunk/low-tech sci-fi games in general, so the setting and graphic design were welcome, and the graphics in general are polished and original. The aesthetic of gears and pistons and steam is great, with plenty of dynamic shadows and good sound design, though plenty of areas seem way too dark and sometimes the reflective metal surfaces can be a little overbearing.\n\nRather than having a four-man party as is standard of the genre, you play a single predetermined character, though he doesn't seem very interesting even several hours in. Couple that with some slightly cheesy voice-acting, I would have preferred character creation in a game like this, though the various notes and audio diaries you find develop the story pretty well. The introduction may seem extremely reminiscent of Bioshock, but the story and atmosphere manages to go in a very different direction.\n\nMechanically, there is plenty of customization and development for your character, with different weapon types and gadgets to use, and the combat is pretty tight and fast-paced. Early on you can generally dance around single enemies to avoid damage, but later rooms and groups of enemies will require quick thinking and good memory of tiles and rooms, as well as knowing which enemies to pick apart and which to knock out later.\n\nBesides combat, there are plenty of traps and puzzles to fiddle around with, usually involving switches, turrets, buttons, trapdoors, and even the occasional block-pushing puzzle. The obstacles never feel annoying or obnoxious, though for some reason there are pits full of spikes that will instantly kill you in this pseudo-modern sci-fi tower, so do remember to manually save often and watch your step.\n\nThe introduction of the game is pretty easy, but it quickly gets challenging or outright frustrating. Despite that, if it feels like a level is too hard or unreasonable, you can take different paths in order to find equipment and enemies more suitable for your character. There are also secret rooms with unique equipment or stat upgrades throughout the game, so cooling off from a difficult area and experimenting is beneficial.\n\nAt this point, I've tried at least three different character builds, so most of my play time has been playing through the first few hours multiple times, but the game has plenty of content and good variety of obstacles and environments, as well as consistently giving you new puzzles with interesting solutions. Developing your characters skills and stats also drastically change how you can play the game, so there's plenty of potential for replay value.\n\nIn terms of content, the only disappointment so far is that the game reuses most of the basic enemies and introduces new enemies very gradually, with all the old ones simply getting higher stats. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a different flavor of first-person RPG, I'd say it's definitely worth the money, though I may suggest playing on Easy even if you've beaten other games like it.", "recommendationid": "35399130", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507900", "timestamp_created": 1506900140, "author": {"num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 248, "playtime_forever": 1065, "last_played": 1507137959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1065, "steamid": "76561198005072824"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506776548, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This short review of Vaporum is based solely on my experiences in the two first levels of the mysterious Tower, but I doubt that my initial, very positive opinion of the game would chance later. \n\nTechnically Vaporum is a traditional, first-person dungeon crawler, but what separates it from the other modern additions (Legend of Grimrock, Dungeon Kingdom etc) to the genre is the steampunk setting and the fact that you play as a single character instead of controlling a party. Vaporum does not try to reinvent the wheel: You will come across levers, buttons and pressure plates, traps and puzzles - and of course adversaries to fight against in the classic \"hit, strafe, turn, repeat\" style. Good old square dance we all know and love. :) On the Normal difficulty level the monsters (which come in mechanic and organic forms) appear a bit too easy to overcome, but I am sure things get tougher the upper you venture in the Tower. The puzzles so far haven't posed any real challenge either, but I expect them to become harder later on.\n\nTo summarize, Vaporum is a fresh addition to the genre and well worth its price.

I'm so very glad I did. \n\nIt creates the atmosphere of being in a dark, creepy, danger-filled tower. The game is kind about detailing the basic mechanics and game functionality, but it does lack a little in explaining some of the finer details you need to know. (Turning pedistals, secret switches, the Argo-thing) The graphics are amazing. I have the settings maxed out on my PC and it does a great job of lighting and refracting as needed to make you look closely at details around every corner. Even a large amount of the small/secret switches blend right in with the background. \n\nThe combat is classic FPS grid-based (Legend of Grimrock's \"Grid dancing\") which I enjoy. This game even throws a nice twist at you being that some monsters can move quicker or slower than others, instead of having them all move at the same speed. It threw me off at first, but it made for a great mechanic.\n\nThe puzzles are familiar, yet unique. I saw some classics that just jump out at say \"I know how this one goes,\" then you'll have the ones that will leave you wondering what the hell you're trying to do. Heck, just finding the secrets can lead you through one hell of a puzzle as well. I actually felt more relief and accomplishment for solving the puzzles and progressing through, rather than \"OMG that was stupid/too easy/bland/whatever.\"\n\nMy only gripes had to be the somewhat sluggish mouse movement while trying to hit a switch or click on inventory items, and using the \"R\" key for healing. I found myself accidently hitting \"R\" while trying to turn right with the \"E\" key. \n\nIf there was any recommendation I could make to help this game reach a broader audience, I'd say add partial controller support. Partial, being that when I was in combat, I was wishing I could just click one of the bumper buttons to side-step.\n\nOverall, I STRONGLY recommend this game if you're a fan of the genre and can keep yourself from throwing your mouse through your monitor.", "recommendationid": "35461449", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502665", "timestamp_created": 1507085643, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 1119, "last_played": 1507084028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1119, "steamid": "76561198131387728"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506937553, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "A good blend between Bioshock and LoG.

[/b]\n\nThere are only two games in my personal gaming history that made me want to upgrade my computer. One was Dungeon Master and the other Ultima Underworld.\n\nDungeon Master was magical, captivating, scary and wondrous. Grid based exploration with real time combat. Let\u2019s see:\n\n*Had to eat food and monster flesh to survive;\n*Had to drink water as well;\n*Unique magic system using symbols;\n*Full steam into walls caused damage to your thick head;\n*You could fall down floors of the dungeon and hurt yourself;\n*Keys and locks and doors;\n*Hidden switches;\n*Torches ran out and when darkness came you were blind;\n*Luring monsters into doorways and killing them by shutting the door on their stupid heads;\n*Running around in panic;\n*A party of four adventurers to manage where only [i] using [/i] a skill allowed you to improve.\n\nIt spawned other games like Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore.\n\nThen like the name \u2018Reginald\u2019 it disappeared from our world until Legends of Grimrock brought some life back into the genre.\n\n[b] Does Vaporum bring anything new to the genre? [/b]\n\n[h1] Let\u2019s talk about Morris Dancing first. [/h1]\n\n1. Take two steps to your right, turn around and whack with all your might. \n2. Side step left and 180 degrees then whack the troll, killing is just a breeze!\n\n[b] Combat [/b] in these games is typically known as square dancing where on a 2x2 space you could typically kill any creature just by moving a step and then waiting for it to follow you. It\u2019s sort of lame but staple of the genre.\n\nVaporum tries to innovate here and I acknowledge the developers tried to stop this from happening. Now I am beginning to think it is simply a consequence of the genre. In this game there are many instances of having to take on more than one opponent at a time, but still the square dancing arose, sometimes due to my own design.\n\nCombat though is interesting. You can build your character in melee, guns or magic or a mixture of everything, including defence. \n\nWe still encounter the common situation in the genre where stepping through, the door closes behind you and a few monster types attack you from previously closed spaces. One time I saw an enemy elevated through the floor which was neat. \n\n[b] 3D puzzles [/b] come back with a bang. These range from leaving a little brick on a pressure plate to timing puzzles involving blocking rays of light. At one point two at a time!\n\nSome of these puzzles will make you mad with frustration and lead you to searching the forums and walkthroughs. Personally I liked the Sokoban puzzle.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the puzzles being a staple of the genre in the early days and maybe it was Legend of Grimrock that brought enhanced puzzling into the arena. Now we have timing, throwing, falling, stepping, any of which often stop your progress. Many times I question why these puzzles are there in the world. It\u2019s almost like the player is caught in a rats maze with the developer trying to establish our intelligence. As if the game was an elaborate IQ test disguised as a game. In Vaporum I asked myself why in this world I had to solve THIS puzzle to proceed. It made no sense.\n\nBeyond combat the levels are of different design to keep things fresh but the individual maps are too small. Dungeon Master was a bit sprawling but this game is more compact. I suppose because you are in a building, not a random, meandering underground dungeon. We do have the ability to annotate maps which is a plus but unlike many other games where I would have loved to have had that option, in Vaporum I found myself only using that option once.\n\n[b] Monsters are well designed and at least one causing me to soil myself and another jumping out of my chair. [/b]\n\nI hate the little spider things. There is a wide range of abilities and some have patterns that can disrupt your Morris Dancing. These are good.\n\nYour single character is part voiced which is good innovation for the genre. There is a slight Bioshock meets Dungeon Master feel to the product which is fascinating in what else can be done in the future.  Some of the background story can be read and others heard via recordings.\n\nI liked the levelling system and the options to build your character as it was quite flexible. If you had played as a melee character there is a good possibility you might try another play through using magic.\n\nThe graphics and sound are almost stupendous as a representative of the genre. It\u2019s a shame though that I have not found any light switches to see what the engine looks like in full brightness mode. \n\nIn summary then, as someone who has played a lot of games in this genre, I like it a lot. It has certainly brought some innovation to the genre and I am looking forward with some positivity to the future. Ultimately though, this game only adds a few new steps to Morris Dancing and I think it\u2019s time we have a completely new dance.", "recommendationid": "35457631", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500179", "timestamp_created": 1507068382, "author": {"num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 513, "playtime_forever": 1406, "last_played": 1507140459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1406, "steamid": "76561197999018200"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507147523, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great game, neat graphics, one of the best of its rare genre", "recommendationid": "35479650", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500179", "timestamp_created": 1507147523, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 186, "last_played": 1507154423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 186, "steamid": "76561197979626170"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507054060, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Vaporum's major drawback is that it feels like an outright clone of Bioshock on a much smaller scale. What if Bioshock was a group of about 200 people messing around with godlike powers instead of a whole city. That and the VA for the main character falls the fuck apart. He reads lines too fast, he has no emotion, and he sounds so fucking boring. But the gameplay is solid and the level design is pretty good as well. Pretty good game but it takes some self drive to keep going because the story and male va sure as hell didn't have me pushing forward. Get this game if you want a solid RPG, good puzzle mechanics, and fun combat.
