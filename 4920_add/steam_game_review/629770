The main strength of the game is its art and its sound design.  The music is haunting and the sound effects atmospheric.  The hand-drawn backgrounds and characters are very well done, and really make this game a pleasure to look at.  The sound design, including the music, is beyond incredible.  I found myself waiting a while during each delivery cutscene to let the sound work itself up to a frenzy until I clicked through.  The puzzles are very simple, and I was only stumped once.  The main strength of the game is its art and the music and sound that accompany it.\n\nPro:\nBeautiful artwork\nAtmospheric sound/music\nIntriguing world\n\nCon:\nCould possible be longer for the money\n\nI'll definitely be showing this one to friends.", "recommendationid": "34892555", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505175798, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 154, "last_played": 1505175140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050159460"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505948065, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun and relaxing little game with some interesting little puzzles. \nNo speaking and no text makes you think and adds alot of charm to this beautiful game.\nGreat music, great art work. good revisiting value aswell.\n10/10 from me.
