Everything was so well-detailed and illustrated, I swear that my eyes met the most artistic indie game ever designed. Aesthetics is number one here.\n\nAnother great aspect was the flow of the story. The game wasn't so solely focused on the positive memories nor their negative counterparts. From stepping into the \"colorful, fantasy-filled world\" all the way to \"war\", the process of combining memories going from positive to negative is a great process, rather than the opposite. Doing so from negative to positive would give the wrong idea since the Master stated that \"war\" is the means to an end instead of \"peace\". The way this game flows memory elements is incredibly logical.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the good philosophical thoughts that were embedded within this game. I think the protagonist mentioned something along the lines of \"...time stops when one sits down with a fresh brew of coffee and relaxes himself within a story.\" You did what the protagonist did, and I really respect that aspect: as a result, Caligo is story-rich with nicely-unrelated imagery and mind-provoking critical thinking.\n\nWould give this a perfect 10/10, in my opinion!\n\n\nIf you want to see my gameplay of it, here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L4ZcTDz1gA", "recommendationid": "35358013", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506815594, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_forever": 60, "last_played": 1506800515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "steamid": "76561198331865846"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506891044, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Just bought this game...it seems interesting but I'm getting 30fps on ultra at 1440p with a 7700k @5ghz GTX 1070 16gb DDR4 Ram @ 3200Mhz.
