That's my experience with that kind of stuff of course sometimes I am wrong look up The Adventures of Fei Duanmu or Tricolour Lovestory for good chinese translations.\n\nAnyway what do we have here is just some boring school love on the countryside. At least thats how the game presents itself. Nice that they have good looking CG's and voice acting right at the start, but that doesn't seem like enough to make up for story introducing containing mostly \"eh ah, and complaining from our main idiot\". First time you see it you already want to quit it.\n\nYeah if you bought it at least you didn't pay much but in current state of VN market this is a simply waste of time and click bait for cheap loli romance. But hey maybe I am wrong? I am not gonna check it all to make sure soory.\n\n", "recommendationid": "35114642", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500225", "timestamp_created": 1506030589, "author": {"num_reviews": 174, "num_games_owned": 641, "playtime_forever": 183, "last_played": 1505655421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009282696"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506065620, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Not saying that this is a bad game, but I created a macro that does the LMB command on an average of 217CPS, and let it rip on this game, all I had to do was make 2 choices within the game and then I had it beat in 10 minutes.
