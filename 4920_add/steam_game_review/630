On most dificulties the games enemies coming in waves enforce cooperation. Fireing lanes start to matter and even when you are not on point but securing the back You feel like Your job matters. \n\nThe game offers 8 marines to pick from. A pair of each of 4 archetypes. The medic, whos main role is to heal any damage and cure infestations. The Autogunner whos there to push the group forward or to set up supressing fire defending the group. The demolitions marine is best suited to dealing with heavier targets with the use of flamethrowers, mines grenades fire traps and the mean end of a shotgun. Finaly theres the technician for those who want to make the missions easier by welding doors and hacking security and objectives. \n\nIndividual skill is rewarded with all of these archetypes without the loss of sense of benefiting from the teamwork of entire group. \n\nThe setting pays hommage to classic movies and games of the alien franchise yet remains its own kind of alien style with a bit more arcade look. The topdown camera gives a more tactical feel for the gameplay in comparission to first person. Each marine has his own quips and oneliners, and character. \n\nSince its free i cannot see how you wouldnt recommend it."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485734512, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526977", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 16, "recommendationid": "29575950", "votes_up": 23, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083456252", "num_reviews": 17, "last_played": 1489425367, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 325}, "timestamp_updated": 1485734512, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[b]Positives[/b]\nIt's free.\nYou kill alien bugs.\nReplayability with different weapons, and characters, or difficulties.\nAchievements make you feel like you achieved something.
