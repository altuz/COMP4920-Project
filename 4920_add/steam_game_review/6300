It deviates from the traditional point & click style of its predecessor, opting instead for something in between 3rd person action game and puzzle-solving adventure game.  Some aspects worked out well, others not so much.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nStill the story, which is what Adventure games are for (IMHO.)  It's not [i]as good[/i] as The Longest Journey's story, but it's a worthy sequel.  The game has you switching back and forth between 3 different playable characters; April Ryan, Zoe Castillo and Kian Alvane.  They also get creative when these characters inevitably start crossing paths with each other.  One particularly clever sequence has two of them bump into each other on the street, resulting in a conversation where you get to choose dialogue options for both characters in turn.  You walk into the sequence controlling one character and then walk away from it controlling the other.  I found that amusing.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThe controls.  Believe it or not, I actually played through the entire game using keyboard and mouse, and trust me when I say, these controls are every bit as confusing and awkward as other reviewers make them sound.  I got used to them in time, but they definitely ARE NOT intuitive.  You may want to use a game pad instead, if it's an option for you.\n\nApart from the actual controls, the game also includes some mechanics that really have no place in an Adventure game in the first place.  They work poorly and feel like an afterthought during design - thankfully, they're easy enough to work around once you get used to them.  Combat, for example.  There are two kinds of fights you get into; ones you're [i]supposed to win[/i] and ones you're [i]not.[/i]  In the former kind, you just spam attack buttons and the enemy AI barely reacts, let alone fights back.  The latter, you'll be killed (or almost killed) in one shot and do next to no damage yourself.  You're [i]supposed to avoid those fights[/i], and it should generally be obvious as to how.  Honestly, they should've just left combat out or made these sequences cut-scenes instead.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nHard to say.  Depends on how important the story is compared to the actual game play in your opinion.  I like the game because it continues the story and setting of one of my favourite Point & Click games ever, so I can overlook the trash controls.  Your mileage may vary.\n\n[b]Should I Buy It?[/b]\nI would say definitely buy it (for the story) if you've played and enjoyed The Longest Journey, but be aware that this game plays [i]very differently[/i] in terms of controls and mechanics.  \n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.
