All links to their webites are dead.\n\nThat being said, I'll still give it a fair review.\n\nPros:\n- Cute!\n- Fun and addicting party game\n\nCons:\n- As previously mentioned, it's a dead game. No updates or tech support\n- Many people experiencing game braking bugs (Game refusing to open or launching in demo being the biggest one)\n- User base is borderline non-existent too. Noboyd plays anymore.\n\nVERDICT:\nSince it's a dead game with multiple game-breaking issues, DO NOT BUY. You will most likely be stuck with a game that simply won't even launch. If it does, have fun playing with bots cause there are no players. Wish I could give a more positive review of the game because I like it, but that's just the way it is."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503865039, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503834", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34538163", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011726945", "num_reviews": 90, "last_played": 1503611110, "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 699}, "timestamp_updated": 1503865211, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Be the Dragon and do all the stereotypical dragon things that those guys were ever described to do in the talking apes' folklore.\n\nThis is a pretty darn excellent arcade game with an insane amount of replay value to it and it's also insanely entertaining to play.\nToo bad it's optimized like crap because even with my 4GB VRAM I have to run this thing with the lower settings on considerably low resolution or else it either crashes on me or completely kills itself graphically with all kinds of visual glitches, but otherwise it's a pretty good game, especially online.\n\nI say you download it's demo and if you can run that one fairly well then you buy the full game for yourself, because even with all the technical hiccups that I've described earlier I'm willing to stand by this game and declare it as actually good.\n\nIf you're into arcade games involving intense point collecting and you're also a fan of dragons then this game is a must for ya, even for the full price."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502584013, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34202908", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198045228139", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502577861, "num_games_owned": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 60}, "timestamp_updated": 1502584013, "received_for_free": false, "review": "very fun, a lot more features for pc than ps3, however no local multiplayer. really breaks the game for me since thats how i almost always play it on ps3"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504292694, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34666977", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198019855433", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1325404800, "num_games_owned": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 589}, "timestamp_updated": 1504292694, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Don't expect massive amounts of depths, but for what it is, it's solid.
