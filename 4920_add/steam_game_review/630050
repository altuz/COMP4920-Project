You must defend your base from zombies, trying to stockpile enough resources to escape before you are overrun. You get 3 actions per turn, which may seem like plenty but will soon run out. You can play survivor and vehicle cards inside or outside your base, or even sacrifice them for different results. These cards remain in play (unless killed / stolen / etc) so can be used again and again. For example, you've played a survivor to kill an undead that was outside your base.  Want to do the same again next turn?  You can but returning the card to your hand before playing it again has used up 2 out of 3 actions for your turn, so you'd better know what you plan to do next. You can use an action to draw a face down card, but doing so will bring a dead along with it. Other cards can be played as one use only action cards, getting to retrieve a card from the trash or revealing a face down card etc.\n\nIf all that sounds interesting, remember that is all happening at one base. \nSingle player could task you with looking after multiple bases at the same time, whilst multiplayer means humans are in charge of other bases, who may or may not have your best interests at heart. Also, events can be triggered throughout the game to drastically change the landscape of the playing field, throwing curveballs into your carefully laid plans.\n\nSuffice to say it can get complicated, but it can be very rewarding when you suceed. Trial and error will inevitably play a part in getting the hang of it, but once you do, you start noticing how combinations of cards complement each other and realising that what at first seemed unfair can be countered.\n\nI've completed the single player game mode 'City Escape' on all the difficulty levels now. Completing the hardest difficulty level on my first attempt at it was genuinely tense and thrilling, something I'll be honest I wasn't expecting to get from a card game. A new single player game mode 'Survival' has just been added to the game, so I'll look forward to playing through that as well.\n\nA downside to the game is that it can be hard to find a match in the multiplayer online mode. I haven't so far - I've played the game with real people locally, but not via the online. But if you've read this far into the review, you can literally help solve that issue! So don't let that put you off, single player and local multiplayer are available.\n\nSo yeah, I would recommend. If you're into tactical card games surely it's a must buy. If you are not, well I would still recommend it. It is something different and if you do get into it, then it is rewarding. Plus the fact that it's being sold at a very reasonable price should mitigate the risk if you don't like it.", "recommendationid": "34415067", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1503406077, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 688, "last_played": 1506701943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "steamid": "76561198030316353"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499717501, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Dead Exit is a post-apocalyptic survival card game that tasks you with fending off zombies and gathering resources.  It plays quickly, it's fun and the solitaire like single player part of the game is good.  Where I imagine this game will shine though is in the multiplayer.  It supports up to 8 players and allows each of them to work with others and form alliances to achieve goals cooperatively, or you can play the bad guy and make things more difficult for the other players while stealing resources from them or of course, a mixture of all of the above.\n\nAll in all, a fun game and if you have a few friends to play with, you'll have a blast with it.

I am a fan of card & board games, yet am tiring of the ccg card games. I'm finding this to be a wonderfully refreshing card game.\n\nAt first I though it to be complicated, but it is actually a very approachable pick up and play game. I like the varying difficult modes in solitaire play as it really helps you to learn the game and incrementally increase the challenge.\n\nAt this time, there doesn't seem to be too many players playing the game, which I hope changes because playing with others really changes the dynamic, strategy and fun factor. I could see very fun tournaments and leaderboards some day.\n\nIf you are a fan of card games and board games, pick this up. It's a high quality fun game at a great price point. No pay to play here.
