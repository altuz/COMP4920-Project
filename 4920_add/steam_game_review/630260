Like when you return from a rough sea trip and your body has trouble adjusting to standing on solid ground. Playing this game gave me the sensation of standing on a small raft, like the ground was actually shifting under my weight! The gameplay is similar to that of the original wooden marble-maze: You tilt the board a bit too much, overcompensate by tilting even more in the other direction, loses the ball and starts over. It's frustrating, but no more than you still want just one more try. What sets this game apart from its humble origins is that you use your entire body to move the board around, a much more physical and tactile experience. The environment and music track gives it all a very meditative and relaxed feel. The physics felt pretty lifelike too. I just wish I had Vive trackers. Alas, the labyrinth itself lacks polish! This becomes all the more notable when contrasted by the detailed environment. Still, Tilted Mind is a worthwhile experience, solidly build upon the strengths of the VR medium.", "recommendationid": "34340578", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1503107901, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 55, "last_played": 1503174704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071465469"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
