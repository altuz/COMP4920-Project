For facks sake I can't even see the whole game screen because the game is that good. It's a game for all ages, I definitely recommend it to the most autistic people you know. They will love it. Explottens is such a unique game and name. Exploding kittens = Explottens. Fucking genius if I do say so myself.

Been looking around alot for a keyboard only game (since i game on a laptop and cbf getting the mouse out) and Explottens is totally playable with just keyboard! Gameplay wise is also addicting, since it has lots of levels and bosses to fight through, which keeps it quite engaging throughout!\n\nGreat little game that loads up almost instantly, and perfect when you just need a quick gaming session (which inevitably ends up being quite a long session cuz it hooks you in with the level progression!

Explottens is awesome because it also ramps up in the intensity and style of Metal Slug but doesn't forget its sense of humour!  Unlike the afore-mentioned games though, there is a narrative with plenty of word play (one boss is a psycotic kitty from Russia called 'Vladimir Cutin').  It certainly doesn't take itself seriously and why would you?  THE AIRCRAFT ARE BEING OPERATED BY KITTENS!\n\nThey may be cute but that doesn't stop them from blowing the shit out of eachother!\n\nI suspect that the show Swat Kats, a US kids TV show from the 90s, was a big inspiration behind this too.  The soundtrack is awesome, very much in the spirit of Iron Maiden's 'Aces High' and the visuals are cartoony, steampunk and intense.  Apparently the developers are from Pakistan, which is cool because I don't know of any other titles that have come out of there.

Would've been awesome if we could've gotten feedback on the boss battles, the multiple sidekicks, the missions and the plethora of upgrade options in guns, utilities and planes. \n\nThere is over 3 hours of content in the game and the reason we're in early access is to get the community's help in shaping an awesome game and helping us with feedback on the controls, the difficulty ramp and (hopefully) multiplayer/co-op. \n\nFor people reading this, we'd urge you to not judge the game by a single review. \n\nWe hope you decide to join the Explottens Early Access. You get access to new features as they are implemented, and you also get to be heavily involved in the process of finding and ironing out bugs.
