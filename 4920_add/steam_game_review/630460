Punchy's Eradication Castle is one part puzzle, one part platformer. You're given between 5 to 7 seconds to clear each floor (optionally collecting coins to extend the timer) which requires either quick wits or multiple contestants (lives) to assess. New mechanics are introduced gradually after the player masters the previous ones.\n\nSlappy's Annhialation Fortress seems like a pretty \"short\" game at first, but it lends itself nicely to those who want to get better scores or unlock more features. If you meet certain conditions (usually based on performance/skill) you'll unlock new towers, giving you more gauntlets to explore and conquer.\n\nWith all the tasty Jumpy Stompy action and no bland filler to speak of, Touchy's Extermination Palace is a solid platforming experience that comes with a positive recommendation.
