Key word: SMALL. You won't be able to create a map of a decent sized city, let-alone a world map. I would have been happy if I could just create a map for one continent in my campaign setting, but nope, can't do that. The problem is that it runs out of memory and crashes if you make your map over 50 tiles wide. If you're running a very quick game and just need to make a short, linear dungeon for your play session then this program can probably deliver and make some beautiful maps. But if you're running a more ambitious open world campaign over a long period of time and want to create maps for your whole world, save your money. I'm hoping this issue will be eventually resolved, at which time I will try it out and potentially change this review to positive.", "recommendationid": "33723289", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487931", "timestamp_created": 1500737141, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 19, "playtime_forever": 42, "last_played": 1500515465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198227235100"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 22, "total_positive": 19, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
