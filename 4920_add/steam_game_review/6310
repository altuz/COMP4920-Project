The story concerns a young woman named April Ryan who discovers that she's instrumental in preventing a catastrophe that threatens the Balance between two worlds; Stark and Arcadia.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nThe story.  I wouldn't necessarily call it \"original\" these days, but it's thoughtful, moving and VERY well told.  It challenges some common tropes of the genre without denying their necessity.  The characters are also well-rounded.  April Ryan is the perfect example of what a female protagonist [i]should be,[/i] in my opinion.  She's not a damsel in distress, but neither is she an arse-kicking, hyper-sexualized, I-am-woman-hear-me-roar style character, the likes of which Hollywood (and many other video games) love to put forward under the label \"strong female lead.\"  April has strengths and weaknesses, hopes and fears.  She has a realistic body type and she dresses in reasonable outfits.  She feels like a real person, which only makes you as a player identify that much more with her plight.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThe graphics were considered pretty good when the game first came out, but they have NOT aged well.  The game is still perfectly playable, but it shows its age.  Likewise, the voices.  Some of the voice actors really go all out, others not so much.  (Thankfully April herself is in the former category, since you'll be listening to her more than anyone else.)  In 1999, when the concept of having voices [i]at all[/i] was still a novelty, this could be overlooked.  Today, it takes its toll.\n\nAlso, with the Steam version, there's one significant bug: confirmation dialogs for [i]exiting the game[/i] or [i]overwriting saves[/i], etc do not display properly (at least on Windows)!  Press \"Y\" for \"Yes\" or \"N\" for \"No\" to get past these mysterious empty white boxes when they pop up.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nThe Longest Journey is probably my favourite P&C adventure game of all time.  The story is the purpose for a game like this, and this story is worth experiencing, even if the audio/visuals are showing their age.  It's also the first installment in a trilogy which does not disappoint as it unfolds in full.\n\n[i]Fair warning to parents:[/i] There is strong language in this game (multiple F-bombs) which you might not expect, given the presentation.  I don't personally find this offensive, but others might.\n\n[b]Should I Buy It?[/b]\nYes.  If you've read the review this far and are still considering it, buy this game!\n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.

It's a shame because it would be a good story if it wasn't for the fact it never tells you your objective, you have to figure out everything for yourself. The puzzles are ridiculously hard to figure out- which is why I won't be finishing it because I don't enjoy using walkthroughs.\n\nQuote from another review which describes perfectly why the puzzles are stupid and make zero sense, which I wish I saw before purchasing the game: \n\n\"I gave up on this game when I found out I had to put a ring on the middle of broken cables to open a valve that would let me get a clamp to combine with a duck that you get by throwing bread through your window and with a clothline I'm not even sure where I got, everything to get an extremely hidden key at the subway that fits perfectly on a fuse box on the other side of the city. The logic of this game DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE\""}, {"votes_down": 15, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504587900, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469899", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34749978", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198096608094", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1504587678, "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 21}, "timestamp_updated": 1504587900, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played this for all of twenty minutes and couldn't continue. It was some of the most cringingly bad writing I've ever encountered in an adventure game.

I don't recommend wasting your time with this one."}]}
