The studio was closed in 2011 due to financial problems after the release of this last game - which was also the probable underlying reason behind the abrupt ending we have here.\n\n19th century, Plymouth. The city is shaken with the untimely death of Sir William, a deformed young noble with a handful of speculations running about his nature in the newspapers. At the time his funeral is being arranged, the swindler and street rat Timothy Moor comes to the city on a cargo carrier as a stowaway, apprehended by sailors. He manages to escape to find his childhood friend Brian for a job, only to find himself in an uncanny intrigue concerning Sir William himself. Following Tim's misfortune, Detective Briscol - who has just started his first day on the job, investigating a disturbance in the cemetery just after the funeral - becomes a part of the same uncanny intrigue as well. As the story progresses, our unlikely heroes will cross paths to try and shed some light into the dreadful business.\n\nSpoilers for the following paragraph! Firstly, the storyline - being interesting enough during the game - closes up with a dark and unsatisfactory ending; leaving many loose ends which results with the unnecessary demise of our heroes. It is wrapped and misconcluded badly, with stupid mistakes on our \"brilliant\" main heroes' part. The last dialogue between our main heroes is misguiding and uncharacteristic, screaming out \"we couldn't end the game as we intended to due to budget problems\". The whole experience is as good as it lasts, but by the last 10 minutes of the game, you'll be disappointed if you'll be expecting an interesting conclusion.\n\nOur main characters on the other hand, are intriguing and well written antiheroes rather than benevolent defenders of justice. They are successfully portrayed with their inner monologues displayed for the player, to reveal some truth to their nature aside their demeanor. They have severe character flaws, somewhat foul natures and an incredible amount of vanity; eventually resulting with their own downfall. Very humane and very well-done.\n\nGraphics are made in AGDC, resulting in a successfully grim atmosphere with grayish colors dominating the century. Environment design is probably one of the upsides of the game, alongside an especially satisfactory voice acting with proper accents of the time. Character interactions and facial features are also appreciable. As an adventure game, [i]Alter Ego[/i] is nothing extraordinary though. There are hardly any puzzles or actual item combinations. Items themselves are pretty obvious to encounter and gather too. As a mystery and crime investigation game though, it sure is noteworthy - especially the parts where we play as detective Bristol: gathering clues, interrogating witnesses and trying to guess the logic behind occurrences. The parts with Tim rely on story progression rather than mystery mainly and presents loose ends for detective Briscol eventually.\n\nIf you are to keep your expectations limited, [i]Alter Ego[/i] is a nice experience with a really lame ending. It has some imaginative ideas, good character builds and a potentially interesting story if only it would be displayed a bit more elaborately.

Good for those who like the point and click adventure genres, not good for those starting out in it. I think it's too expensive for what it is. If it was cheaper, it would be probably more worth a recommend.\n\n [b]Pros[/b]\n\nDetailed environments \u2013 lots of little things to look at\nVoice acting is nice, Irish and English accents!\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\nReally slow paced\n\n [h1]Gameplay[/h1] \n\n\u201cCan you climb, naked man?\u201d A point and click puzzle game, your character starts by escaping from a prison via a sewage/flood system, looking remarkably clean, if a little naked and handcuffed. He's a thief accosted by English constables, in a time where racial tensions between the Irish and English are at an all time high. When he picks up objects, they mysteriously disappear into his pants, and some of the animations are very slow ... and the character does have a slight habit of over explaining his actions during a successful \u201cpuzzle\u201d, which could get annoying after a while. Yes smash the lock. No need to go further into it.\n\n The character has a habit of reminding himself he can't do things or that something happened, or thinking that people are simple and how he needs to manipulate them \u2013 attributing to his thief-like character of dubious morals. Who also really dislikes hard work. Or work that requires effort in general. He's not a nice guy for sure, though entertaining in the way he interacts with people. You'll either like him or hate his guts. He seems to try and get around the game with his silver tongue. The dialogue between him and the woman who helps him out at the start is a little unbelievable, it progresses too conveniently. The accents are nice to listen to, though the main character is a little flat toned. But hey! Irish accents. It's very dialogue heavy so you'll spend a lot of time talking with characters and going through each talk option.\n\nThe environments are well rendered, they're not amazing but thought and detail has gone into it, from dirty basins to rust and pots and pans and objects lying around everywhere, giving the appearance of a run down, shabby and poor area. It's dilapidated and grimy, the less glamorous side of the Victorian style era, and this same level of detail persists in each scene you go into.\n\nThe game itself is a little too slow paced for me, things take too long to interact with, so I fast start losing interest in the adventure, despite the good environment, potential intriguing plot and interesting voice actors with their own quirks.\n\n\nWant to read more of my reviews?

It was branded by its developer as a \"dark adventure game\"; I don't consider it very dark, but it is atmospheric. The game is set in Plymouth, England in 1894. Throughout the game you alternate between two characters, Timothy Moor, a petty hood seeking to find a better life, and Detective Sergeant Briscol, a rigid agent of law and order.\n\nThere are a few technical issues with the game; most notable for me was probably the discrepancy between the character models' mouth movements and the spoken dialogue. Occasionally characters' mouths would move while there was no dialogue, or there would be dialogue, but no mouth movement, or the wrong character would be in sync with the speech. Also, when a playable character reflected in thought to himself, sometimes his mouth would move even though he was only thinking, or there would be slight reverberation to his internal monologue in some environments, as if he had spoken aloud. There were occasional differences between the subtitles and the spoken dialogue, as well as at least one mislabeled inventory item[spoiler](at the beginning of the game, Tim's manacled wrists are labeled \"lucky horseshoe\", an item which doesn't appear until later in the game)[/spoiler], but nothing irritatingly glaring. I think the same sound effect was employed for both walking and running, and there were a few other details-oriented issues like that which should have been polished out prior to the game's release.\n\nMuch like [i]The Black Mirror[/i] (which was also developed by Future Games s.r.o.), [i]Alter Ego[/i] revolves around a compelling atmosphere, and I liked the soundscape. I noticed that a few of the sound effects and music samples are reused from [i]The Black Mirror[/i], but I don't consider this an issue, as they are as equally at home in [i]Alter Ego[/i] as they were in [i]The Black Mirror[/i]. The voice acting was competent, and didn't cause distraction. [quasi-spoiler][spoiler]Like [i]The Black Mirror[/i], [i]Alter Ego[/i] has a f\u2665ck-you-for-playing ending that hardly rewards for the time invested.[/spoiler][/quasi-spoiler] I believe the game would have benefited from having multiple possible endings. Perhaps a sequel was intended.\n\nIf you don't enjoy adventure games, you should probably pass on this game. If you do enjoy adventure games and see [i]Alter Ego[/i] on sale, consider giving it a try. I recommend watching a few videos of it first, in order to get a feel for it. I bought it when it was on sale, and I do not regret my purchase. In terms of pacing, [i]Alter Ego[/i] somewhat reminded me of a few ICOM Simulations, Inc games (such as [i]Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective[/i], [i]Dracula Unleashed[/i], etc), that is to say that it is leisurely paced. As for navigational efficiency, double-clicking on an action item or other point on the screen will cause your character to run to it rather than stroll [spoiler](Note: Tim can't run until his handcuffs have been removed)[/spoiler]. Double-clicking on an exit allows you to leave the current screen more quickly, rather than the playable character having to traverse the entirety of the distance to the exit, but unfortunately you can't access the map whenever you choose in order to jump to a different location, first you must exit the current location. When playing, you can display the active hotspots if you abhor pixel hunting, although without using the hotspot display feature I don't recall ever feeling like I had to tediously search around, plus the cursor turns red when hovering over a hotspot. Some of the tasks weren't straightforward, not in terms of being challenging, but in terms of defying real-world expectation, and there are also several tantalizingly unfinished plotlines; however, the story makes up for these shortcomings, in my opinion. For the most part the game flowed reasonably well, although the game does feel somewhat rushed and incomplete content-wise, like the developers had more planned than they had time or budget to execute.\n\n[i]Alter Ego[/i] was the final release by Future Games before the studio closed. If you enjoyed an adventure game like [i]Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers[/i], you might like [i]Alter Ego[/i]. And if you like [i]Alter Ego[/i], you may wish to also check out [i]The Black Mirror[/i] (when it is on sale), although the graphics of [i]The Black Mirror[/i] are more dated. [i]Black Mirror II: Reigning Evil[/i] & [i]Black Mirror III: Final Fear[/i] were developed by a different studio (Cranberry Production GmbH), and while perhaps technically superior, aren't crafted in a way that is as appealing to me. I would have liked to see what Future Games could have done with more resources at its disposal.\n\nSCORE: [b]53[/b] out of 100 - [b]Fair[/b]\n\nSUMMARY: If you enjoy the occasional adventure game, this isn't a bad game to add to your collection if you pick it up it when it is on sale. If you only buy a couple of titles a year, or don't care for the adventure game genre, this likely isn't the game for you and you should put your money towards something else.\n\nADVISORY: \"[url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/63110/announcements/detail/1515773076242585877]Fix for invisible characters in Alter Ego[/url]\""}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1474626647, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501360", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "25648294", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041598487", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1474573261, "num_games_owned": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 543}, "timestamp_updated": 1474626647, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Decent point & click adventure game with a storyline that is nice but could have been great if only the developers had more imagination.

The ending is a bit boring, clearly set up for a sequel which was never made (at least I haven't been able to find it anywhere on internet).

I take it upon myself to at least start and give it a little playtime to get a limited impression about quality.\n\nSo, it seems visually quite nice though the mechanics and dialogues can be a bit annoying since every time you examine something it \"plays\" through a description scene. I would think first time would be enough and simply stick to written description for subsequent clicks.\n\nThe story seem to be ok and the interface somewhat ok too.\n\nGraphics, animation and sound is not top notch but absolutely decent and nothing I'd complain about.\n\nSo, if point and click games is our thing, I suspect this might be an ok game to play. Have seen much worse while not much better, so I think it deserves a thump up rather than one down.\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1469741937, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502735", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "24583992", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198011726692", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1469737948, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 513}, "timestamp_updated": 1469741937, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It might have been a really nice game, but it isn't.

The game ended in a really poor manner. \n\nThe plot is somewhat disappointing. You go through it looking for something which should feature it amongst a lot of similar games, but you won't find it here. It's just another point and click mystery game with irritating accents like:\n- places too dark to see some little piece without which you can't progress further\n- going backwards and searching the same places, because you missed something... and that's happened to me some times when I was forced to search through a walkthrough to find a solution\n- not skippable locations through which you must pass to go to the desired places\n\nBut those are problems of a tons of other poorly designed point and clicks, right?\n\nI wouldn't be so disappointed if the plot wasn't that poor. You expect something more exciting and you find only a repetitive game. Pity.\n\n5/10 and negative opinion. Sorry game.

Just looking at the cover you would imagine the game follows some character who lives a double life; one as a good citizen, the other a darker kind of villain. I was expecting something along the lines of a Jekyll and Hyde game.\n\nInstead you play as two independent characters one an Irish rascal, the other a straight-laced English policeman. The game doesn't involve any problem solving but more like going from one place to another clicking on different things, and figuring out what to do next. The story is enjoyable whilst you're playing it, it unravells nicely and keeps you gripped.\n\nNothing however can really compensate for how poor the ending is. I'ts not simply that the ending is an unhappy one for both protagonists but it renders the whole story pointless.\n\nThere is one stupid part where you have to steal the ledger from a shop associated with the villain. This involves:\n1. Walking outside from the church\n2. Walking outside the main gates\n3. Walking from outside the main gates to outside the shop.\n4. Click on the door.\nAnd thats it. After you click on the door you're automatically sent back to the church after a brief monologue and tell you're partner \"Here you go, I've got the account book\" (not the exact wording, but that's basically what happens). Stupid, utterly stupid.\n\nThere are far better point and clicks out there. Find anohter."}]}
