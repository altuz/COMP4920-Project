However, i do agree they should have started in beta.\nPros\n+Difficult\n   Alot of people are having issues keeping their people alive. I'd say after the 2nd run i was able to do alot better while still having some challenges.\n+Decent Music\n   The music is relaxing and when in times of combat it gives off this urgency feel to it.\n+Combat\n   It gets very tatical at some point. Their was one situation where i helped other races soo much in a short period of time. That the other races who hated them started to attack me all at once. The battle i faced was 3 races and wolves all at the same time; leading to a total of 26 enemy units. \n   It was insane on how i had to move my troops to defend my people, eventually i had to give everyone a sword to defend themselves from this attack. Even then i still lost 1 person. I'm just glad i had extra swords in my storage or my town would have been wipped out.\n+Endless/sell community\n   Love town builers that give you the option to keep on building or even sell your community to start over with extra cash.\n++Devs are working on game still\n   This is always the best thing to see, they are giving really good communication as well on how the games development is going along.\nCons\n-Pathfinding\n   Needs some work, its gotten better to the point where they don't get stuck anywhere. However the troops after slaying an enemy will return to their post insteead of attacking other enemies.\n-Buggy\n   As far as bugs go, the only real problem i faced is when your soilders would return their swords after they eat and not get them back. Making your soilders only attack for like 3 damage.\n-Lack of content\n   As i said at the begining should have started in beta, their are a few things that the descriptions say we should have but we don't. Luckly, as i said in the pros the devs are still working on the game and keeping us updated very well. :D", "recommendationid": "35026069", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502134", "timestamp_created": 1505661846, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 209, "playtime_forever": 909, "last_played": 1502925762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050158479"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505674243, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A very well made game already I havent noticed very many bugs except for a loading screen bug where it gets stuck every once in a while this game has a lot of potential.", "recommendationid": "35030644", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497674", "timestamp_created": 1505674243, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 1790, "last_played": 1506810460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 347, "steamid": "76561198120553036"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 30, "total_positive": 19, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
