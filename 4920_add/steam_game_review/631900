I have played a few music rhythm games in VR including Audioshield and Thumper, and this one has to be by far my favorite. Firstly it looks great, with a bright and colorful trippy aesthetic, where you speed far above a landscape that pulses and shifts in time with the music. Neon mountains in the distance bounce along with the beat whilst giant geometric shapes blaze past you at high speed. It's graphically simple, with primarily flat tones to its visuals which ensures it runs smoothly, and crucially there is never a moment where the visuals interfere with gameplay (as in Audioshield's visual effects and notably its Horizon environment). \n\nThe music is overall very good, mostly a mix of Asian pop and electronica. This isn't really my sort of music but it is perfect for this type of game. There is a good mix of songs and likely something for everyone. The gameplay is fun and gets you moving, and at higher difficulties demands precision. If there are any faults it's that unlocking new songs doesn't feel quite right, as you continue to unlock new songs with incentives to play them on easy difficulties well after you've adjusted to playing much harder songs. \n\nThis is overall a very high quality and polished VR music rhythm game. Though it is not really that similar to either, I would recommend it over Thumper or Audioshield.", "recommendationid": "33739039", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1500798007, "author": {"num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 287, "playtime_forever": 524, "last_played": 1505528056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993703914"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 18, "total_positive": 17, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
