The puzzles are actually quite fun, though they do make me feel a bit stupid at times. Some are pure logic ones involving levers, weights, timing, and so forth, but a fair amount of others have to do with figuring out the geometry of the space you're in. The game is quite beautiful at times, and while it feels (I can't tell for sure yet) like it is not going to have many sandbox elements or choices, it's pretty relaxing if you take your time. Just take a look at the video and I hope you'll see that this is no ordinary \"random game that was released with a flurry of other games on Steam\", the developer put a true effort into making it worth the bother.", "recommendationid": "34957000", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510507", "timestamp_created": 1505420803, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 140, "playtime_forever": 1881, "last_played": 1505532677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198278889834"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505823214, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hmm...., what can I say? The game is good.\nIt makes you think a lot. You need to think where to go, where to push buttons and in what sequence, to make your light smaller not to be found by enemies or to fight with them.\nPicture is good, textures in some places are bitting, but it looks still good.\nI liked a lot ship controls. It's very easy to control it and get where you want.\nAlso, I liked crafting and equipment system.

Though the graphics are built on a dated engine, I had a bit of fun with the game.  I made it to level 3 and was a bit frustrated with how long this particular level was taking to solve.  Your drone, which you use for the puzzle aspect of the game, moves quite slowly and level 3 is a LARGE level.  Moving from one end to the other was just taking too much time.  \n\nThe other aspect of the game - the planet rebuilding, is quite nice.  The whole game has a little bit of that 'Planet Driller' vibe; very indie but well done.  \n\nI am, however, deciding to refund it as I think the price point is a little high for what Zibylon has to offer.
