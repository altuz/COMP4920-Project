Immortal Planet is, as advertised, an isometric souls-like game. It uses the same familiar stamina system. There is no rolling, but you do dash, so in that regard it's more like Bloodborne. \n\nThe story is captivating, the controls are tight, all enemies require study to defeat. So all is good in that department.\n\nThe bosses are also very interesting and complex. The two I've faced so far have 3 phases which are outlined by some UI bars above their heads. The boss hits deal HUGE damage, but they are very well telegraphed, so it works out.\n\nThe character leveling system and customization is also reasonably robust. So far I've discovered 3 spells that all have interesting and situation dependent properties. A lot of strategy here.\n\nI think anyone who's a fan of the souls series would not be disappointed with this indie title.\n", "recommendationid": "33845736", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583561", "timestamp_created": 1501207189, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 18, "playtime_forever": 195, "last_played": 1501887612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198369785936"}, "votes_up": 64}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501478678, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "In short, I enjoyed playing this game, it was more enjoyable than I originally thought it would be. Before I go on though I would point out that, I am very much the targeted demographic being a huge fan of this style of gameplay, having finished the souls series multiple times. Also note that I played the entire game using an Xbox 360 controller so I cannot confirm how well the keyboard handles.\n\nPros:\n\u2022\tLevel design is well done, and encourages short cuts\n\u2022\tThe combat is immediately familiar and holds up to other titles in the genre\n\u2022\tThe weapon and item selection is quite varied allowing for replayability\n\u2022\tEvery single boss is good, some even great (Alpha Twin = Prince Lothric?)\n\u2022\tThe artefact choice at the beginning is great (needs to be a way to swap them)\n\u2022\tFrom first glance, the builds that are possible seem varied and extensive\n\u2022\tDash into enemy to stun is a great mechanic whilst not perfect\n\u2022\tThe story whilst not perfect is surprisingly interesting, and a great take on the whole hero keeps resurrecting idea that the souls games are known for\n\u2022\tNot to spoil anything but the challenges to get more healing is something I personally really like.\n\nCons:\n\u2022\tDash is not the most accurate of movements which causes some issues in both traversing the level and during combat\n\u2022\tResting resets the state of your weapon\n\u2022\tDoor mechanics can occasionally force an area reset\n\u2022\tSome enemy attacks can be hyper specific at any distance (Prisoner One Laser Beam)\n\u2022\tThere is the occasional attack which does not give any time to react leading to some unfair deaths (Toxic grenade, Psycher Rifle)\n\u2022\tParrying seems a bit too easy (maybe just me?)\n\u2022\tThere needs to be some obvious rest point after a boss which isn\u2019t always the case\n\u2022\tBlocking does not seem to stagger enemy chain attacks\n\u2022\tThe mimic enemies are too random and I was mostly annoyed by them\n\nBugs:\n\u2022\tSmall thing where going up an elevator into the hub section, before the elevator even arrives you can move the camera like you are walking normally before you are even in the level.\n\u2022\tThere were two points where I had to reset the level as a door closed as an enemy on the other side of it had seen me\n\u2022\tThe biggest issue by far is that the final boss in the ship got stuck on walls a whole bunch, which ended the fight prematurely for me\n\nSummary\nI beat the game in 8 hours, and I did not feel I was rushing, the time whilst not huge is fine for a game like this as the levels don\u2019t vary significantly and the game does not want to waste your time. Because of the 2D plane the combat whilst enjoyable is not as nuanced as something like dark souls, and the shorter time means that it does not get exhausting like a 20-hour game would. In summary, I don\u2019t think the game is for everyone but souls/ soulsborne fans will enjoy it, I personally would pay full price for this but getting it during a sale would be even better especially if people see value for time put into a game as it is not the longest of experiences.

I think the game has great combat, dialogue, level design, art direction and immersive atmosphere. The pace of the combat can be a little slow due to reliance on stamina and avoiding attacks. Everything that this game does has a purpose in my opinion but someone who is not familiar with the genre may find movement a little stiff. In short, I think this is a fantastic game for people who like methodically slow gameplay that relies on timing, patience, and reflexes. It also has a limited 90-degree animation which is nostalgic but causes some aiming problems.\n\n[b] FAQ [/b]\n\n[h1] Game Length: [/h1] I hate that question. Approximately 8 to 12 Hours. I have beaten DemonSouls and DarkSouls but I don't rush through games. It was a respectably long experience for the price.  \n[h1] Replay Value (moderate):[/h1] After beating the game you can play Nightmare mode which changes some things like dialogue. The game is fun enough to play around with different builds and weapons. Unfortunately, no achievements to encourage that.\n[h1] Level Variety (good):[/h1] There are 4 main areas and they all have different enemies, backgrounds with lots of detail and unique challenges. \n[h1] RPG elements:[/h1] You can level up your stats and find many different abilities that scale with the stats. There is virtually no actual loot/armor or skins. Although there are couple unique weapons that change gameplay.\n[h1] Difficulty:[/h1] Very hard game but if you suck you can farm quickly enough until it gets easy.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nIf you ever played DarkSouls it is heavily mimicked after it. Just about everything you do requires stamina like attack, dash, run, block and even shooting. Reliance on stamina is what creates back and forth combat that many Souls fans enjoy. Whenever you kill an enemy you gain currency that you can spend to increase stats. If you die the currency stays on the ground for you to pick up on next try. The level layout is very user-friendly and even incorporates limited platforming. You can't really jump but you can dash across platforms and die if you misjudge the distance. That plays a bigger part in gameplay when platforms start moving or when enemies use gaps to their advantage. \n\nThis game sort of has a Bleach(anime) treatment for weapons. Each weapon has 2 forms that have different range, damage, and sometimes special ability. Balancing between weapon forms can be questionable and some of them feel very similar to other weapons. It is a very fun feature but I would have preferred more abilities between fewer weapons . Around the game, you will find all kinds of consumable items like flying discs, mines, pistols and even several different spells. It adds a lot of depth to combat and fun factor in general. Spells and some items scale in damage depending on stats. At higher stat numbers the maximum item/spell capacity also increases.\n\nThe difficulty is fair. Don't get me wrong the game can be frustrating but I never felt like it was BS. Even if you find the game too hard you will eventually overcome it with flat stats like spell damage if you want to make it easy. I don't like some of the balancing in the game and in that regard, the developer should have added achievements for using less ideal tactics. (like beat the game with no spells)\n\n[b] Level Design [/b]\n\nLevels are very easy to memorize and the lack of a map is not a huge problem. Each time you beat an area you will usually get a short cut to travel faster. If I am not mistaken main areas are Temple, Archives, Prison and Fortress. They take 1 to 3 hours to complete based on difficulty. In a true spirit of Souls, you can do a harder area first . I really enjoyed the artwork and unique set pieces around the levels ( they are not just color swaps )\n\n[b] Music/Dialogue and Immersion [/b]\n\nI found the game to be very Atmospheric. It really reminded me of Harbinger which is one of my favorite immersive games. The ambient music is not very noticeable but it really fits the tone of the game. The story is told through next but it was well written. The subject of immortals who are stuck in an eternal struggle for the purpose is very intriguing. I got to say that the regular ending was extremely disappointing. You will probably get a very sour taste by the end ( considering that game was so good up to that point )\n\n[h1] Rating 9/10 [/h1] Immortal Planet has a very specific target audience that likes a good challenge and mothedicly slow combat. If you want to progress fast you will pay for it with sweat and tears. I am sure not everyone will like it, especially if this is your first Souls game. However, I have to rate this game based on what it tries to accomplish and it is great Souls-Like game.

There are a lot of things about that I like ,the aesthetic, setting, even the combat, but there a lot of little things that when brought together drag this game down.\n\n1. Slow combat\n       This isn't actually a bad thing, and the combat is enjoyable. My only gripe is that the best method is often just to knock enemies off the edge since it can be much quicker than killing them straight up.\n\n2. Slow movement speed\n      Walk speed being slow doesn't really matter, but the sprint speed is barely faster, and this just makes the game annoying to play.\n\n3. Collecting heals\n      Like dark souls you spawn with a healing item. However, in immortal blood you can only ever spawn with one, and if you want more you must collect them. On its own not a problem.\n\n4. Doors\n     Doors won't let you pass if there is an aggro'd enemy nearby. Not usually a problem, except one time I tried to bait an enemy who was waiting for me at the end of a hallway. I aggro'd him from outside of the hallway, but the door just closed blocking us from reaching each other. Leaving the area and returning did not reset the door, and as it was the only path fowards I had to jump off an edge. \n\n5. Random spawns\n      enemies will randomly spawn from chests which contain heals. On its own no big deal, and makes the game more interesting.\n\nAll of these things on their own are fine, but when they are all present in the game they slow it down so much that it just becomes a slog. This is epecially the case when you are trying to go fight a boss. You have to try to dodge all the enemies (so you can get through the doors) while also collecting some heals, which could also randomly produce an enemey. Its slow, but fighting enemies is even slower, and it just becomes annoying to have get through each time you want to fight a boss.\n\nTL;DR\nAesthetic, lore, setting are good.\n\nCombat is slow, movement is sloor, doors are funny, only 1 innnate heal must collect others, random enemy spawns from chests.

If you are looking for Dark Souls mechanics in a different way, this is probably a good choice, if you like the isometric view of the camera and controls. \n\nThe gameplay is very solid, everything you do is meaningful in terms of fighting. Do you attack? Should you dodge as soon as you see the attack? Should you block? Is it safe to heal? This game rewards patience and reflexes. However mechanics wise, i have issues with the dodge/block mechanic. When you are blocking and try to dodge, it does nothing. Which is fine, but the thing is that it buffers the dodge. So when you hold block, press dodge, then let go of block within a few frames of pressing dodge; you will dodge in the direction you were blocking at, meaning most of the time you will probably be dashing into the enemy. Which can turn the fight sour since on how the dodge mechanic works in this game. This has been at least 70% percent of my deaths, where i dashed into a half stamina enemy when i didn't even want to. \n\nAlso, there is a lack of personal customization. You can't change the controls. To me that is a big minus, since I honestly do not like the button setup on both the controller or the keyboard and mouse, but I've delt with it for now. Can't really do much on the visual and audio, I mean I like playing my own music while playing the sound effects of the game, can't do that either. All sound and music is a combined volume.\n\nWhen it comes to equipment, the idea is ok. The way how items work is fair. No qualms with it. BUT, I'm hoping down the line in, can an option be there if i just want equip all spells or gadgets. As well as the healing item should be it's own slot\n\nNow when it comes to weapons, each weapon may have different versions that changes how the weapon works and usage. Usually it's like a weaker version and then a stronger version that consumes more stamina compared to the weaker version. There are a few exceptions, but not the norm. Usually the difference comes when you \"awaken\" the weapon, or transforming the weapon. All weapons seems to have to their own unique mechanic when they \"awaken\" which is neat. Some may have passives, i just don't feel like it's really explained very well if they do or not.\n\nWhich comes to my next topic, information. Specifically detailed gameplay information. I mean sure, it paints the lore really well, but doesn't really explain game mechanics that well. When you're leveling up, you don't know what your points do and you have to keep shuffling points to see what the points do. When you're shopping, some items need a requirement to equip it, and when you're buying the items, you don't know if there is a requirement or not. you don't know if you're buying an item you can't even use yet. Those are just a few.\n\nEven though with those flaws in my opinion, this is a great game for anybody who like soulslike games. 4/5.", "recommendationid": "33940436", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506299", "timestamp_created": 1501554589, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 212, "playtime_forever": 718, "last_played": 1505533846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034940687"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501299645, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Remember your first time playing Dark Souls, how you treked through the Undead Asylum, struggling through these underlings that were no more than wasted flesh and broken swords?

For a lot of issues that when put togethere make the experience a frustrating affair. \n\nTo start with the positives the aesthetic and lore are all really interesting and unique. It reminds me of hyper light drifter and the way that much better game (in the mechanical sense) presented itself. The level design itself is also really good and has taken the right ideas from the likes of Dark Souls. \n\nHowever it seems along with a lot of other games attempting to be soulsborne-like (what a mouthful) have all left me with mixed feelings only one I really liked with no reservations was hyper light drifter and that game was not trying its hardest to be JUST like dark souls in every way and had its own ideas for once. Many fail to understand the reason why FromSofts games are so good. \n\nOne of my first issues is just that, the game doesnt feel very unique. It borrows a lot of systems from dark souls and I cant personally place anything really new or diffirent. Not every game has to innovate but it would be nice to have a bit of variation here and there.\n\nSecondly everything about it feels really sluggish. From the movement to the combat. Even more so than games within this new genre. This coupled with the janky \"dash\" ability. Sometimes you will plumit to your death when you SHOULD of made the jump. It should be also noted that often times attacks that shouldnt of hit you will because of the bad hit detection. The combat feels under developed and 3 starting weapons dont help. \n\nThe bosses suck, theres nothing visually interesting about them and whats worse is you have to fight them all twice. Yeah sounds like fun. Whats worse is they dont seem to have much cooldown and just end up spamming attacks. This coupled with the fact they can all stun lock you is no fun at all. Not to mention how cramped the arenas to fight them are.\n\nAnother annoying feature is the game sometimes locks doors forcing you to fight enemies. A feature that adds to the slow feeling. \n\nFinally you have only one heal when you spawn. You cant upgrade it or change that based on settings or difficulty. Making bosses a even greater pain because you have to waste time and health trying to get more heals.

There aren't enough weapons, and builds are kind of thin due to the stat mechanics. Most weapons function the same outside of some very pointless awakening abilities, do the same kind of DPS regardless of whether you level up STR or AGI. Not much thought was given to items and how they function in the game, and being a \"mage\" is sort of a support thing more than anything.\n\nThe world is interesting enough, and how you progress through the rooms is very clostrophobic but well done thanks to the decent combat.  But with only 2 or 3 areas needed to progress toward the end, there's very little freedom felt outside of choosing which to tackle first. And because there's very little scope to build your character, the desire to keep exploring kind of wanes.\n\nThis is a worthwhile 7 hours of your time.

Granted my complaints are still there but hopefully this time I can word them properly instead of letting the salt take hold of me.\n\nFirst Problem:Keyboard controls.\nI'm just going to gloss over this since the game tells you upfront that its meant for a gamepad, and it shows. Now the controls for keyboard aren't bad but you can really see what they were going for when you use a gamepad. SO yeah, this is a game where a gamepad is a must if you want to be as good as you can be.\n\nSecond:Immortal Blood\nThanks to the developer actually telling me in his response to the review mixed in with me reading items, I now know the name of this game's Estus Flask. My complaints are basically the same as my last review. Lets say I have 5 immortal blood and I die, when I respawn I am dropped down to 1, which not gonna lie, is kind of annoying. Granted you can reloot the chests which had them before but it is still tedious to go back and get them. However thanks to the developer's response you can actually go out and buy them from certain npcs. I would have prefered having the same amount when I die but at least its something.\n\nThird:Combat (kind of)\nNow I still stand by my previous review that the game is meant for one on one combat, with fighting more than one enemy seeming to be an after thought. However, it's not nearly as hard I previously made it out to be. I was simply being an idiot and panicking when facing more than one enemy. With that being said it can be difficult facing one oppent when others use moves that you can't block. Granted you can dash buuuuuuuuuuuuut I'll just save that for my next point.\n\nFourth:Dashing\nNow I am fairly sure this is a problem with me specifically but I want to point it out in case anyone has a similar one. Dashing is honestly hard for me to do properly, though this is mostly when I am in a bind more so than anything else. Though from what I have seen with keyboard controls you generally just aim the mouse where you want to dash. Sounds simple enough but the mouse is kind of insane with how precise you need to be. Being slightly off can often result in you just passing enemies with low stamina or even falling to your own death. But like I said, this is me sucking at the controls. I just wanted to point this out as a nitpick more so than anything else.\n\nFifth:Looting Surprises\nI recently discovered this and am now puttign it in this review. Sometimes when you loot a chest you can face the possibility of an enemy sort of popping above the loot and attacking you. However this seems to just be a percent chance of happening with specific chests. Unlike the first Dark Souls games they don' t seem to have a specific feature showing that they contain enemies. Unless I am just an idiot and miss the clear warning signs.\n\nSixth:Unblockable attacks (kind of)\nThis is mostly about the bosses you face later on and is mixed in with dashing, but I'll get to the point. Bosses will have three stages of attacks shown by bars around their health. Each stage with show new attacks and pattens. Some of these include a dash which stuns you and gives your enemy a free hit, or more annoyingly, a beam of light which can set the ground on fire along with causing decent damage. The main problem I have is that the move itself seems to have some obscure tracking to a degree. Plus mix this move with orbs that will lauch themselves at you at different times and you have an annoying obstacle to overcome. Now this could just be me sucking with the dash, but more often than not my attempts to dodge just leave me getting hit.\n\nSeventh:Blocking \nSuper small nitpick but sometimes enemies can get a free hit dependent on where they are standing, since they might slightly be at an angle that I can't block. You see your character faces in four ways, and has a bit of aoe when they block, sometimes enemies can be just outside of this aoe but you can't really tell since its so small.\n\n(Edit 6):Red Highlighted Enemies\nSometimes if an enemy is highlighted in red you can block the attack, and others you can't. I'm fucking sorry, what? Who would make such a stupid design choice? Sure you can learn from playing which ones you can dodge and can't but that is such a dick move, leading me to believe that I can block specific attacks when the enemy becomes red, and then being punished for it since the game lied to me. Honest to god I'm not sure if this is an over sight or just a dick move on the dev's part.\n\nAnd that's about it, just a bunch of small nitpicks which might not even exist if you use a gamepad like the game tells you. Even with all of these problems I have a love-hate relationship with this game likely the hate coming from a mixture of me sucking and not using gamepad controls.  Though with that aside the game has pretty nice art, interesting NPCs similar to the first Dark Souls game, along with lore and concepts seemingly from dark souls but with a nice sci fi element to them. However, I am still not 100% if I can recommend this game with confidence without using the game pad more. BUT, if you have a gamepad I would highly recommend this game, if not, you might want to wait a bit.\n\nUltimately this game is a lot like souls, with bosses being difficult, individual enemies having the ability to kill you on their own, along with a lot of interesting story and character concepts wrapped up in a neat package.\n\n(Edit 2) After spending more time with the game I have something quick to say. The bosses are fucking terrible. I'm sorry, but the first few are actually pretty good imo, anything past the alien commander and Prisoner one if I am being generous, is just cheap. The enemy before twin alpha begins to show the cracks with him just throwing so much crap at you. It's not difficult, just tedious. Then you have the actual twin alpha or whoever boss fight which is 1v2 style boss fight. Which honestly seems like a cool idea but its just not done well.\n\nAs of now I am bit stuck on Twin Alpha but I plan on beating the game at least once in order to get my money's worth. And my last nit pick for now. The chest do indeed have random enemies popping up at random chance, which is retarded. At least have something different about them visually, like a different shade of blue, a different color in general, a symbol on the chest, or at least make it so the enemy is stunned for a bit so I don't get face fucked. If this is a feature then please someone tell me what the signs are, I am tired of being low on health, then getting face fucked by an asshole who ia redo of Prisoner one. Honestly I am just on the edge of putting this game as a non recommend since the bosses are just so fucking obnoxious. Granted there are exploits for certain items but if I have to spam specific items to win then whats the point?\n\n(Edit 4)Fairly certain that I am on the final boss, and oh my, it is awful. It's basically like you face another player, they have items, different weapon modes, spells, et cetera. In fact they can even heal themselves along with regain all of their god damn stamina. Doesn't that sound like a fun boss? Oh and the best part is that they split off and make two of themselves. Along with contain moves from all previous bosses and use spam them even more. So yeah, pretty fun game with terrible bosses after prisoner one.\n\n(Edit 5)This isn't so much a review but as I was killing the final boss my boyfriend said \"Become Saitama to win.\" So that was interesting.", "recommendationid": "33895579", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499777", "timestamp_created": 1501383786, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_forever": 1896, "last_played": 1502249248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198107797443"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501402345, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The hardest part of this game is dealing with the hypcrisy of enemy stamina.\n\nA good teeth grindy game.
