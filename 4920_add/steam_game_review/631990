As a rule, i don't do well with horror, but I did enjoy the producer's other games- Seduce me and Seduce Me 2. Wanting to show my support, I did cave and buy it, hoping that I'd at least get a an hour of enjoyment out of it.\n\nI got way more than that.\n\nThe story, first off, is really intriguing and I found myself trying to pick apart the mystery before i got to the end. Each character is really well written and I found myself wanting to learn more and more about their story and grow closer to them. Each choice made me stop and think, as i wanted to react the best way i could to each situation but each choice had its own merits. When i finally got to the gameplay and mazes, I found myself slightly scared, as each is pretty terrifying, but also determined to beat it. They were easy to get the hang of and, while it was sometimes hard to get through certain ones, it took dedication and memorization to get through them. None stumped me for more than 15 minutes at most.\n\nWhen i got to the ending, i wasn't expecting what i got. I won't go into detail but each path gives you a little more insight and, by the end, i found myself torn on what to do. The final maze is difficult, but ultimately i was satisfied by the ending i achieved.\n\nMoving on, the art style is really asthetically pleasing and each character is easy to differenchiate from the others. On top of that, the voice acting for everyone in the game was almost perfectly done, even for the villain themselves. Whether it was characters breaking down at certain points of the game or [spoiler] the villain screaming at you when they caught you in the maze [/spoiler], the voices really got the emotion and intensity of the scene across. \n\nUltimately, i feel that the game is more of a psychological puzzle game than it is a horror game, but i understand what the creators were going for. I had a very satisfying experience with the game and I highly recommend purchasing it. Solving a mystery and heading through a maze was never so satisfying.", "recommendationid": "31709420", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492433", "timestamp_created": 1494620400, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_forever": 440, "last_played": 1495958520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139415975"}, "votes_up": 29}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494691921, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First off, I haven't completely finished the game as I still have quite a few achievements to go, but I wanted to leave a review of my first playthrough, and a few bits I've replayed. I may update this with more things when I've achieved everything.\n\nPros:\n\n-The story is very interesting and gripping; a well written mystery that you find yourself trying to unravel throughout.\n-The characters are all multi-dimensional, which gives way to lots of interesting scenes. \n-The art (sprites, cgs, and bg art) is very nice and well done.\n-Full English voice acting which is really good and really helps bring emotion to scenes (and if you're not a fan of listening to voice acting as you play, you can turn this off!)\n-Multiple endings - [spoiler] I got the true ending on my first playthrough, which was pleasant. The bad and cruel ends though are pretty brutal.[/spoiler]\n-Replayability in order to discover dialogue and the whole mystery. [spoiler] There's three or four (I can't remember exactly) chances to talk to any of the 4 other characters. I talked to Peter every time, so you could replay several times in order to get each characters dialogue.[/spoiler]\n-The music fits well with the atmosphere and emotion of the scenes they're in.\n-The maze puzzle is pretty fun and makes you feel quite tense while playing it, [spoiler] due to the high stakes in game.[/spoiler]\n-Two romantic options (I believe): [spoiler]Peter and Rosa[/spoiler], if you wish to persue that or you have the option to remain friends.\n-The main villain of the game was just plain creepy - [spoiler] the laugh is just so horrifying, especially during minigames [/spoiler]\n\n\nCons:\n\n-One playthrough of listening to all the dialogue took me about 2 hours. For some people, this may be disatisfying in terms of the price of the game, but honestly due to replayability this probably doesn't matter too much.\n-Sometimes the VA is quite quiet and soft at times [spoiler] mostly during emotional scenes near the end [/spoiler] which leads to the music overpowering it; so I'd recommend turning the music down quite a bit lower than the VA. \n\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed this game, and would reccommend it to those who enjoy the visual novel format as well as the psychological mystery and horror genres.", "recommendationid": "31727674", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494257", "timestamp_created": 1494691921, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 361, "last_played": 1498238664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198132788744"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495090751, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've followed Micheala Law's stuff for a long time, and I've been looking forward to this game for months.  All that waiting paid off, and I wasn't disappointed;  another game with fantastic writing, great characters, and a story that keeps you guessing the whole way through and packs a strong emotional punch.  The game's artistic quality is also top-notch:  all of the artwork is gorgeous and detailed, the music and sound design is beautiful and does a great job at setting the right tone, and the voice acting ranges from pretty good to absolutely fantastic.  You can tell that the main actors are giving their all, and boy does it pay off at the right moments - the final act of the game really hits you like a truck because of their performances.\n\nThe story had me on the edge of my seat the whole time - the constant tension of trying to figure out who was guilty and who wasn't played a large part in my enjoyment of the game on my first playthrough.  I also had some fun trying to figure out ways they could escape or fight back against the kidnapper, though none of them played out.  [spoiler] I'll admit that the final revelation wasn't as earth-shattering as I was anticipating, but it still allowed the game to remain in a relatively moral grey area - which is a hard balance to pull off, so I can respect that. [/spoiler]\n\nSubsequent playthroughs are also worth doing - each character has their own spotlight route, if you choose to focus on them in the cutscenes.  Each one feels pretty unique and it allows for some really nice development of their personalities, backstories, and relationships.  It also unlocks some really nice bonuses in the 'Extras' area, like the kidnapper's journals and some bloopers from the actors.\n\nThat being said, the game isn't without some light criticisms.  Particularly the maze portions:  While the puzzles themselves are well thought-out and genuinely challenging, the technical limitations of the Ren'Py engine prevent them from working as well as they should.  The controls lag occasionally, and the block-by-block movement can mess with players' timing when it comes to switching direction.  Another thing to mention is that the maze will change every time you play:  if you fail and reload, you won't get the same layout to navigate as you did before.  While this does add another layer of challenge, it also messed with me quite a bit on my first playthrough;  the Ladybug puzzle in particular took me around two hours to complete because I had no idea which map I would be dealing with and kept mixing them up at critical moments.  Oh, and the game's background music can get a bit loud at times too, but that's hardly worth complaining about when it can easily be fixed by changing the audio settings.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a great thrill ride.  15$ might seem pricey at first, but trust me it's worth every penny and it's going towards supporting a pair of game developers that honestly deserve so much more recognition for what they do.", "recommendationid": "31817470", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494555", "timestamp_created": 1495090751, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 113, "playtime_forever": 979, "last_played": 1498611615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198093340488"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496689962, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I really enjoyed most of this game and I want to reccomend it, but I can't.\nThe first two mazes and last two are challenging but enjoyably tense.\nThe thrid maze is a nightmare. It may be framerate issues, which aren't that great even with the animations turned off, but if the bee hits you twice or three times, you may as well reload from your last save. While the 3rd maze is unique and I liked the challenging gimick, but the moment the bee is in your sight there is little to no time to react to run away instead of running [or flying in this case] headlong in to it, and when you run in to your pursuer and it gets you you're frozen for several agonizing seconds as the timer keeps going down, which is a fair punishment for the other mazes but it's nearly impossible to change direction to get away from the bee even without roadblocks.\nIf you're a patient person then it may not phase you as much. But if you're prone to gamer rage....you might smash your keyboard into a million peices.\nIt's like the Fade from the original Dragon Age, the entire game is good fun, and then \"Oh god this part again...\" and it's the most tedious part dragging down a great game. The big difference is that Dragon Age has hours upon hours of content to distract you while Remember, Remember is a short VN suspense game and thus not as much content to distract from that one glaring stage that you will inevitaly have to suffer through again and if you want to get everything.", "recommendationid": "32206315", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516210", "timestamp_created": 1496689962, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 86, "playtime_forever": 158, "last_played": 1496689045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049413457"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496117492, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I really want to recommend this game but there are just enough problems with it that makes it hard to do so.\n\nThe premise is really, really cool.  While the overall setting takes heavy inspiration from the Saw films, the central conflict of the story is interesting and unique.  The characters have voice actors, all of whom are surprisingly competent given the indie nature of the game.  They're also reasonably well-written, although I was a little miffed at how wildly inconsistent the main character could be given you control his choices.  All in all, the writing is good enough and this is, after all, a visual novel, so clearly that matters quite a bit.\n\nSo why, then, can't I recommend it? There are a few faults with the game.  First, the main \"gameplay\" element of the game is incredibly poorly optimized.  I have a rig that can run games like For Honor and The Witcher 3 at max settings and the gameplay here chugs along like you're trying to walk through water, and given the nature of the gameplay it actually makes things rather frustrating.  The \"fix\" the developers suggested - turning the animations off - actually somehow succeeded in making the problem worse, which is quite counter-intuitive.\n\nThe length of the game bothered me too.  I haven't even clocked two and a half hours and I've seen and done almost everything.  There are a few more lines of dialogue that I've yet to see but I know all the twists and I know the big revelation at the end.  But none of these things would matter if not for...\n\n...The price tag.  While this isn't No Man's Sky at launch levels, I find it incredibly difficult to justify the $15.99 price, especially in light of the fact that the far, far superior - in both content and story - VA-11 HALL-A is actually a dollar less.\n\nThis isn't a bad VN by any means.  But its problems combined with its price tag made me feel like it was not worth the money.  If it drops below $10? Sure, give it a whirl.  But at $16? Pass.  If you have any love for visual novels, put your dollars on VA-11 HALL-A.", "recommendationid": "32055344", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510624", "timestamp_created": 1496117268, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 232, "playtime_forever": 130, "last_played": 1496029663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960789209"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494782584, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love the game, the only thing is that even with the preformance turned down the mazes are still quite laggy.
