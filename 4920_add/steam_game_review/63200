Unfortunately, it was never well balanced and the developers soon suicided the game by releasing a standalone free-to-play version called Super Monday Night Combat that split the player base and eventually resulted in the slow inglorious death of both games. If you can find someone to play with, MNC is a rather unique and exciting experience, otherwise it is just another sad case of untimely death."}]}
