My opinion of CrossCells is thoroughly mixed and while at its core it's a great idea, the major grievances I have with it make me hesitant to recommend it.\n\nTo start off, I love Matthew Brown's other games, Hexcells and SquareCells. However, CrossCells is fundamentally different from both of those. In Hexcells/SquareCells, if you mark or clear a tile incorrectly, you are penalized with a mistake, and that encourages you to solve the puzzles with zero mistakes, which is completely doable because everything can be figured out via a series of logical steps.\n\nWith CrossCells however, there is no mistake counter. If you make a mistake, you won't know until you run into a contradiction later on. This leads into my main problem with this game. In Hexcells/SquareCells, sometimes two options will be possible, and those lead to their own logical branches. However, those branches almost always converge a few steps later, where you see the branch you took either leads to a contradiction or the right path. These branches can be calculated in your head since they are short.\n\nIn many CrossCells puzzles, these branches extend the entire length of the puzzle, making calculation beforehand nearly impossible unless you have a natural gift for it. This takes what could have been a fun game of logic and arithmetic and turns it into a trial-and-error slog where you have to follow the branch all the way to its logical conclusion, and if it doesn't work, reset the puzzle. Since there are no penalties for CrossCells, this further adds to the trial-and-error aspect since you can mark/clear tiles all you want without fear of repercussion. It's a step down in design in my opinion because it does not take advantage of the fact that it's a video game. CrossCells could easily be put on paper, whereas Hexcells and SquareCells by their nature could not.\n\nIt's a shame because some things in CrossCells I found really clever. Sometimes I had to use a sort of \"meta logic\" to solve the puzzles. For example, if there are two tiles, and one or both of them can be cleared, but there are absolutely no other informational clues in the whole puzzle related to those two tiles, I had to make the deduction that since the game would not force me to guess in such an obvious manner, both tiles can be cleared.\n\nHowever, given the heavy trial-and-error aspect of long logical branches combined with the lack of any penalty for mistakes, I simply can't in good faith recommend CrossCells.", "recommendationid": "35128778", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520668", "timestamp_created": 1506089655, "author": {"num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 2313, "playtime_forever": 338, "last_played": 1506087803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 160, "steamid": "76561198018056824"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506136919, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I recommend this game with one significant caveat. Namely, I consider this the weakest game in the series. So if you have not played any of the HexCells or SquareCells, I recommend those above this game by a significant margin. Only if you've played all of the other games would I recommend this to scratch a similar itch if you feel the need, and even then, it comes as (what I perceive) a step down in engagement.\n\nI don't regret playing it, but I had higher hopes. It's hard to say exactly where this really falls down for me, but I think it's that I had a harder time juggling all the interdependent variables in a way that tipped the scales a little more towards work than pleasure compared to the other games in the -Cells series, or my beloved Picross games. It may well be that smarter players than me might find this more rather than less enjoyable than the other -Cells games. I can't discount the possibility that I lack a large enough working memory to make this more enjoyable to play. That said, I feel that there's a fairly narrow segment of players who want to work harder on their puzzles, but are satisfied with doing so for only two hours. For me, CrossCells sits in an awkward middle ground between the chill-out style puzzle games like its precessors and deeper and more complex games such as those by Zachtronics (e.g. SpaceChem, Infinifactory, et. al.). It's fine for what it is, but I'd rather play something that's more towards one extreme or the other.", "recommendationid": "35142968", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515480", "timestamp_created": 1506136850, "author": {"num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 545, "playtime_forever": 144, "last_played": 1506135656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "steamid": "76561197970575361"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505507827, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you enjoyed the other games by Matthew Brown then you'll probably enjoy this game.
