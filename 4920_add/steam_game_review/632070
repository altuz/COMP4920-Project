The graphics are doing their job really well (even on the lowest settings) and give the game scenery it's agressive and scary beauty. \nThe plot is nothing spectacular in it self but has some nice twists and turns throughout the entire storyline. I do not want to spoil anything but do play through the entire game in one session if possible (I did it in 2.5h but I'm sure it can be done in less) to get the whole picture. Although it is a shame that the story is entierly linear...\n\nSadly I found the music/audio to be somewhat lacking, which is sad for a game that is marketing itself on being inspired by Beethoven's only opera. The soundtrack in itself is good, no question about it, but the occasional mixing and layering of different soundtracks (on purpose or not...) made me feel somewhat lost. Aswell as the game lacking some clear audio effects:\n - No footstep or splash sound when walking in water\n - Mostly the same footstep sound no matter if walking on dirt or snow\n - Some interactibles lacked sound effects which made them feel \"hollow\" and without weight\n\nControl wise the game clearly is made to be played with a controller and not with mouse and keyboard (although it is possible). Especially noticable is this when the cursor randomly dissapears from the menu or the camera goes into som kind of \"hold-and-drag\" mode. Another thing that annoyed me was the fact that I as the player never got any control over when I wanted my flash light to be on or off. I understand that there are some points in the game where the player should not get access to something that makes seeing easier but there are better solutions to that than taking the decision entierly away from the player. \n\nMy last little nit-picky-critic-point is the lack of some kind of inventory symbols. Although there was no need to know what you had at your disposal (because of the game always using the right tool for you), it would have been nice to have some kind of icon reminding you: \"Hey you got this flash light back there, why don't you use it to get through this dark cave?\"\n\nOverall I do recommend the game to anyone who likes games like Firewatch or any other pussel adventure with a bit of horror mixed into it, especially if it is on sale! \n\nI hope this was helpfull :)\nFrokes", "recommendationid": "35002242", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505581696, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 152, "last_played": 1505580358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198101988292"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505648152, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Awesome game and very good ending", "recommendationid": "35021210", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505648152, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 94, "last_played": 1505489713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198411297666"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505676955, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I absolutely adored this game, the visuals and sound were so remarkable and totally engaged me within the first few minutes of the game.
