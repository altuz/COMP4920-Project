I would say my percent for giving this a thumbs down is 49/51% I may revisit it at a later date and change it to a thumbs up but for today I was too disappointed in the things I wanted in this game.\n\nArt:\nEven before I bought the game I had a problem with the art style. The colors look too faded and the character designs felt a bit either plain or pale. Look at the chests of each character and point out a design that you like that differentiates themselves from what you would picture a generic version of this game to be. \n\nChoices:\nSo what I will say is probably my favorite part of visual novels is the choices, but what I will criticize about the genre as a whole is that when you are presented the choices you are rarely given the context if you auto skipped the text up to this point. I know that these games try to drag out the length by writing longer text boxes but I feel it's to the detriment of the genre instead of the benefit. I'm a 'brevity is the soul of wit' kind of guy. It's fine if one character is very verbose and goes on great diatribes of explanation but when ever character does it, then it begins to feel like bad writing. And that's a problem because I know the people who write these games aren't bad writers, it's just that the shorter the exposition, the shorter the game, or they could try to add in more choices but then that either forces them to add in false choices or program for more choices. I sympathize with the developers on this issue but when characters drag on, my score drags down. \n\nConclusion:\nIf you buy this game, I don't think you will be disappointed it but if you are a clone of me, you will be disappointed. What was I hoping for from this game? I was hoping for a visual novel version of Crusader Kings 2 set in Imperial England, this is more average visual novel with meaningful choices.", "recommendationid": "35228429", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495147", "timestamp_created": 1506453489, "author": {"num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 325, "playtime_forever": 5, "last_played": 1506453075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561198041400335"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
