It reminded me of Creeper World and I liked all three of them. This seems to be lot like Creeper World with some nice base building and tower defense thrown in. I have to say...the game is intense. You also have to control the path of your attack bots, defend, build your base and keep up with your resources. I'm still getting used to the controls and could recommend some changes, but all-in-all I'm really enjoying the game. There's over 40 missions and different ways to play so I think the price is fair. Its a nice new take on tower defense.", "recommendationid": "31942678", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505600", "timestamp_created": 1495667379, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 4483, "playtime_forever": 156, "last_played": 1495667938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970900751"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496021651, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1497104387, "votes_down": 11, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "developer_response": "We improved controls in the latest update.
