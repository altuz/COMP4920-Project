Here are my observations:\n\nTai Chi: simple but fun. I wish there are more game elements or special effects. But I guess for a relaxation application this probably enough. The screenshots of the gameplay may be under stated. Touching balls and moving bodies are actually more fun that it looks.\n\nBalancing: physics are weird, but I can get used to it with some practice. I think this is a common issue with VR's lacking real physical feedback. Not this software's fault.  I found it easier to stack if you gentally drop the rock instead of trying to put it on top of another.\n\nHINT: you can actually take 360 screenshots of your stones. I found this very interesting. I hope the developer can descirbe this feature in a more obvious way.\n\nHINT2: you can press the keyboard to generate letter cubes. I don't know what it is to do with mindfulness practice. But it is fun to make some funny words and take a screenshot\n\nBreaing: Not much here, just simply breathing. I think this should benefit some people with breathing difficulties or have trouble relaxing. Not for me though.\n\nOverall: This software shows some promise in innovative VR gameplay. I will recommend this to people who want to try new ways for general wellness or fitness.", "recommendationid": "32484245", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1497643562, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 16, "last_played": 1497642549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198397525988"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497569216, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1497575695, "votes_down": 9, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "developer_response": "We are sorry you felt this way about our software. As an Early Access release, we understand that not all of the features are in obvious place.\n\nFor Tai-Chi, if you are new to motion games, we suggest you start with the Easy mode. You can change game mode with the tab with a gear icon. Also, we encourage you to try it with your favorite background music with the music tab.\n\nFor Breathing, you can also adjust different breathing technique within the gear tab. As breathing pattern vary individual by individual, we encourage you to use the control we have to find the pattern that works best for you.\n\nFor Balancing, we know that we cannot do full physical feedback yet with current hardware, but we encourage you to try a little more. Our custom physical engine actually make balancing much easier than stacking real rocks.\n\nAs for scoring, we see it more like credits that you can earn during the exercise. You can track your progress as earning more points. We don't force anyone to try to get higher score, nor compete for scores.\n\nHope this answers your concerns. As an EarlyAccess release, your reviews are extremely valuable for us and we hear every words. The WiseMind team sincerely hope you can revise your review to bring some encouragement to our team that can motivate us to produce a better product!", "review": "I'm always interested in ways to relax my busy mind, so I tried this...\n\nThere are 3 exercices : the first one is Tai-Chi which is pretty difficult if you have never done this IRL like me. I'm pretty sure I wasn't doing this correctly, but there's nobody around to guide you or correct you. I think it's better to first practise (at least) the basics with a real teacher.  During your exercise you can see your score, but I think Mindfullness and relaxtion isn't usually linked to a score.\n\nThe 2nd exercise is breathing : you can see your breath going in and out, like it's very cold while it's clearly summer around you (green trees) so it's rather like you're smoking. Breathing exercises are usually done in different patterns, some of them are quit challening (f.e. breathng in shortly, but breathing out for a long time) but in this VR app, you only have Equal Breathing which means breathing in and out takes the same amount of time. You don't have to wear VR glasses to do this simple breathing exercise.\n\nThe 3rd exercise is balancing rocks, but we all know how VR physics can behave, so it will likely make you more nervous than focused or calm.\n\nIt's all very underwhelming especially if you consider the price of 16 EUR.
