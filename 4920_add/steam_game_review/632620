I've been playing guitar as a hobby for many years and always wanted to try drums.  However, I do not have the space to set up a kit and there's also the noise issue.  Guitar Hero drums on expert is as close as I've gotten to playing a real drum set.  This app definitely scratches that itch.  I've been watching some YouTube beginner lessons and practicing with the app and feels good once you get used to holding the thick Vive controllers (vs real drumsticks).  I'm using a old Guitar Hero kick pedal  plugged into my mic input and works well.\n\nWhat I think needs work - \n\nHaving to hit 'K' on the keyboard to position the drum set relative to kick pedal position is a real pain in the ass.   So is 'Q' and 'W' to adjust set height.  There really needs to be a way to do this using UI or controllers from within the HMD.  Maybe you sit on drum stool/chair and face proper direction then hit a UI/controller button to place drum set with fine tuning controls on top of that?\n\nI would also like some sort of control over volume within the app.  I'm using Windows audio drivers and have volume set to max both on Windows controls and within Steam but still would like the drums to be louder... just doesn't seem to go as loud as other VR Steam games.", "recommendationid": "35162371", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509882", "timestamp_created": 1506196043, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_forever": 1634, "last_played": 1506894971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1634, "steamid": "76561198117919693"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506368606, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I'm kind of blown away at how well this works.
