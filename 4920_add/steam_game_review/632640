The weapons all seem to do absolutely no damage to even the first few enemies on screen, and everytime I reset, the Elemental Currency that is used to purchase the weapons do not reset. The first time I tried playing the game, I thought that maybe the reason why I was not able to even remotely harm the basic enemies was because I choose the weakest weapon available, so I reset and tried choosing something that would cost more, and I had the same exact results of next-to-no damage to the enemies.\n\nPlease, fix this, there is no reason for all enemies to be completely and utterly unstoppable (On Normal Mode no less) even in the dead first level. And have the currency reset instead of saving, I'm down to 1 of a random elemental currency because of my unwillingness to continue playing the game due to the fact that I cannot hurt the first wave of enemies!\n\nOnly in easy mode can I hurt the enemies, but they literally provide no form of retaliation whatsoever. They don't even attack me on easy mode. Normal and Hard they're unkillable and shoot at you. But Easy there's no threat.\n\nI understand the game is in early access, but, to make even the first enemy a lost battle is unthinkable. And no, you are not supposed to lose to the first wave, because if you die the game kicks you to the title screen. So the unstoppable nature of the first few enemies is not called for.", "recommendationid": "35171332", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498275", "timestamp_created": 1506230129, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 318, "playtime_forever": 10, "last_played": 1506230087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198000850636"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
