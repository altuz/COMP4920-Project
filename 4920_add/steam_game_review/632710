It also contains part of common route from base game, first 13 chapters, which is cca 20 hours of content alone but if you didnt read base game it wont satisfy you and you will end up buying it anyway (speaking from expirience).\n\nI enjoyed PE /w happiness a lot more then base game. PE had really ridiculus and retarded premise, protagonist is only male student invited into high class all girls shool. If you are familiar with A Kiss For The Petals (Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke wo) then you know what kind of school this is. PE is moege but still insist on having some drama in theyr routes, but drama there is pretty cheap and cringe worthy. I was kind of dissatisfied with heroine routes in base PE, specialy Rise route felt really weird.\n\nThat said PE /w happiness avoids most of shool related ridiculus backstory and totaly ignores drama, so what you get is pure moe :) \nReally PE /w happiness content focuses on fun and cuteness and is ridiculusly good at it.\n\nFandisk equals fanservice and there is quite lot of it, that said steam version of this VN is indeed censored BUT you can get FREE adult content patch directly from mangagamer ... no additional costs. WAY TO GO MANGAGAMER!\n\nThis is great VN for fans of cute girls and fun stories.\nIf you read PE then this is more of the good stuff, if you didnt you can enjoy this VN too, but it will most likely make you buy base PE as well.\n\nChiho is the best girl !", "recommendationid": "34980662", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1505507455, "author": {"num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 900, "playtime_forever": 4236, "last_played": 1505504271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006455520"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505023296, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I think this is the first review I have posted on Steam but I thought I had no choice in this instance. Although the game seems nice the description is blatant false advertising. It says the original comon route is included and considering the original game is marketed as an \"alll ages version\" I falsely assumed that I didn't need to buy the original game to enjoy this one. After the 13th Chapter you get the bait and switch that says the rest of the story needs to be purchased. It now seems they only way to experience the full game is to buy the original game and start all over again. That is also assuming that the content is still the same since it is an \"all ages version\". I cannot recomend this game until these issues are fixed. This should have been marketed as a DLC to the original game in this format. In my opinion I have been ripped off thinking that I was getting a complete game when I only got a tease.\n\nIf you have played the first game then this may be a good purchase but I can't get past that I feel I was taken advantage of and that I believe the developer has commited false advertising and should be made to take responsibility for the misleading descriptiuons.", "recommendationid": "34854238", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497354", "timestamp_created": 1505023296, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 1466, "last_played": 1505021950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998282790"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 14, "total_positive": 12, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
