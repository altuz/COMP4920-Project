Does what it advertises well.\nPoints I like:\n-Video quality is great.\n-It works on Win7.   \n-It's easy to use and has a simple and clean UI.\n-You can activate Vive's front facing camera by pressing the grip button.  Quite handy when you want to grab your drink.  \n-Its built in Youtube video search is pretty good.  The result page provides a video's basic information such as like/dislike count, view count, and length.  Very useful if you watch many Youtube videos.\nI definitely recommend it!", "recommendationid": "31682169", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "timestamp_created": 1494506176, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 48, "playtime_forever": 556, "last_played": 1497170759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198296048600"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495231514, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Stream You tube 360 VR Videos in your headset, This is the only player on Steam that does this and is the key feature of this player, It does all the other stuff too like play from your hard drives, and it also has 3D backgrounds and environments to play with but streaming from you tube is perfect in 2k, It has a great search function and saves your searches to an easy clickable side panel for future searches, simply point at the search box with your vive controller and up pops a keyboard just like the Steam controller.

StarPlayerVR takes the best features from both and combines them into an easy to use interface. \n\nI like that this is built off VLC Media player which I consider to be one of the best players out there.\n\nAside from features, the big deciding factor to purchase the player was just how responsive the developer was.  Before purchasing, I noticed the player was missing the ability to switch between audio tracks.  I suggested the feature to the developer and it was added the very next day!  The developer is extremely responsive and already planning to work on additional features I suggested.  Here's a confirmed list of my suggestions posted today that are now on the roadmap:\n\nA button to turn the light in & out.\nOnce menu hidden, the laser pointer should get out of sight.\nAllow user to adjust the screen's position Y.\nAllow user to Import custom skybox background.\nAdd support to dvd disc.\nAdd support to blu-ray disc.\n\nOne thing that stood out for me after using Vive Video and Vive Cinema is that the audio quality was much louder on StarPlayerVR.  A definite plus. What's a big screen without big sound to match? I thought the volume was too low on the other players even at 100%.\n\nI missed the early bird price and paid the full price of $9.99 and have to say it is well worth it.  I have a good feeling that this player will stay ahead of the curve as new formats are introduced.", "recommendationid": "31777707", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1494888542, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 214, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1495387365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006476011"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494954138, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very easy to use and works great at streaming youtube 3D or 360 or 3D+360 videos.
