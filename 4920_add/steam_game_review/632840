Played single player where you are matched against droids and was hard while satisfying but really people you need to purchase this if you're into VR MP shooters and get some games going.\n\nTrackpad movement as well as teleport cleverly incorporated into the game, weapon choices, hacking droids for passwords, magnet, and blades.\n\nHave played fuck all so far as was blown away by the graphics and smoothness of the game had to write a review. Also had to review early so some of you can purchase and we get some MP games happening.
