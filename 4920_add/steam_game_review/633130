Addictive, graphics, music etc etc ok all great, now talk about what is key on this game:\n\nThe devs are handsome and smell good. Is not common meeting developers (not only videogames developers, i mean of any kind) who smells good, believe me. Their hair is clean too. \"Bahh sef thats too awesome to be real, im sure this people are rude and without manners even if they smell like angels \" nope, they are nice too. Also, the soundtrack is as good as 15 seconds of fresh air in a 37 degrees summer.\n\nI totally recommend this game and their devs.\n\nDevs are not for sale :(\n\nSoundtrack is :D\n\nAnd the game too :D :D", "recommendationid": "33611729", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458559", "timestamp_created": 1500310679, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 731, "playtime_forever": 1670, "last_played": 1496966473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973221045"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_negative": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 89, "total_positive": 80, "review_score": 8}, "success": 1}
