I feel like the world of this game has so much more potential. So many more stories to tell. One thing I disliked was when you replay the game, it can feel as if the different choices you make when you start change nothing. It would of been much more satisfiying if, as an example, the beginning would have a different feel depending on what you choose to do in the game. But thats just what I think.\n\nOverall I belive this game to be very enjoyable and something I would reccomend to many people and find it a very nice experience.", "recommendationid": "33410945", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1499623984, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_forever": 4101, "last_played": 1507073151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2884, "steamid": "76561198365241169"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502063519, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Intersting style of game.
