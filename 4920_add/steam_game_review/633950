Here are my notes:\n\n1. People say this is like Dark Souls, BUT...\nI want to clarify this. Fall of Light is its own game. Yes, you die a lot like Dark Souls and the number crunching is minimal. You have squares that represent HP, you start with 5, so it's very simple, but not in a bad way. I like number crunching a lot, but I was not detered by this system. But this game is very much different. I love the camera (it does not jack with you), I love how it feels like an isometric ARPG in its presentation, but it is not an ARPG. \n\n2. The comabt is really well done. There was a game called \"Examina\" that tried to do very physical-based combat, and this has strains of similarities, but Examina failed miserably. The targeting makes this game awesome, but even without, it was far far better than Examina. I liken this to the combat from Gothic 1 and 2 (LOL Gothic 3 was terrible). You have to learn enemies and time your attacks and defensive moves. Once you learn an enemy, you can dominate him.\n\n3. There are fresh ideas in this game and they are good ideas. The companion you bring with you adds some really cool elements. The aesthetics are fantastic.\n\nReally well done devs, well done. I immediately bought this game upon completing the demo, and the price is right!!\n\n", "recommendationid": "35285641", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528543", "timestamp_created": 1506671108, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 125, "playtime_forever": 289, "last_played": 1506753771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 289, "steamid": "76561197966614606"}, "votes_up": 23}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506650398, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "***Early impressions***\n\nAfter 2 Hours in the demo, which i highly recommend, and now 3+ in the game I'm loving almost everything about Fall of light.
