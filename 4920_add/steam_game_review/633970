I use an application called Vorpx to play lot of non vr 2D games with my Vive headset...and this game plays as if I was using Vorpx...first the field of view is really messed up, everything look stretched out,  elongated..and things don't look symmetrical..When I played the game I felt the developer took a plain 2D game and converted it to a vr game for easy buck.....Also when I first played, everything looked white and unplayable but after following the developers thread on the forum, and turning off the steam overlay...I was able to see the menu and start the game..but once the game started it was even worse.   Please don't be fooled like me and purchase this title based on the beautiful graphics on the store page...I was really glad that steam has a refund policy in place.", "recommendationid": "33334599", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552091", "timestamp_created": 1499409217, "author": {"num_reviews": 53, "num_games_owned": 87, "playtime_forever": 9, "last_played": 1499407944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198329163766"}, "votes_up": 28}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499462960, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Holy rat droppings on a stick batman,\n\nPlease do not buy this game at \u00a314.99, please take into account that i do not own VR so i cannot comment on the gameplay using it, however the gameplay without VR is unequivocally terrible, there is a white haze that covers the screen regardless of any changes made to the settings, and the user friendly side of things is less than friendly.\n\nOnto the actual gameplay, the movement is clunky at best and the 'enemies' just sort of congregate together in a zombie 'esque' manner, there doesnt seem to be very much depth to the game objectives and the use of a blade may as well be using a butter knife.\n\nI love giving different games a chance and usually do reviews of them on my YouTube channel however this one hasnt even made the cutting room floor as it was that bad i didnt even record 1 second of it, P{lease heed my words and do not buy this game yet.
