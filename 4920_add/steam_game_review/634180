It kept my interest. The graphics were very good and I liked the story. The puzzles weren't too difficult. The only negative thing I would have to say about it was going back and forth a lot in locations. I did like the map where you could jump to a location easily. I like to finish puzzles in one location before jumping to another but that is just my preference. All in all, it was an enjoyable game. I definitely would recommend it. I did like the idea that it wasn't just a hidden item game and had variety to puzzles.", "recommendationid": "34990475", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "timestamp_created": 1505548619, "author": {"num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 303, "playtime_forever": 356, "last_played": 1505512308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053791074"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506021867, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is a bit of a shame, really. The animations, backgrounds and music are all top quality and it really has the look and feel of an excellent game. The puzzles are generally good, with only one or two which I found a bit tedious and couldn't be bothered to finish. There's also good variety in puzzles and locations, and the voice acting isn't bad either - particularly considering some of the awful examples out there.\n\nThe story, however, is a real mess as it has too many twists and turns and a real lack of narrative focus. I also can't stand the daughter who I'm meant to be rescuing. There are far too many cut scenes of her giant, weepy, creepy eyes staring out at me, and the same tired dialogue: \"When will you save me, Mummy?\" \"Are you coming soon?\" and so forth. \n\nThe main trouble, however, is that there is a lack of transparency regarding the difference between the 'Standard' and the 'Collector's Edition' of the game. From forums it seems that the Standard Edition only has the main story and none of the collectibles or morphing objects, yet despite this these are still achievements in Steam. Ergo, if you bought the Standard Edition you're left with uncompleted achievements.\n\nIt also seems the other difference is the lack of the Bonus Chapter which you unlock after completing the main quest. The game prompts you that you can download additional materials, but the only option on Steam for DLC is the music. Therefore if you enjoyed the game, you'll have to shell out at least the same amount again to get half the content. This is not made clear on the store page.\n\nOf course, I am just guessing here from what I can find out. It may be there are people there with Standard Edition who have all of this and this is just a technical bug - but there is no way of knowing!\n\nI have contacted the developers and will see if they reply to these problems, and then may well update my review, but at the moment this aspect is so irritating that I cannot give it a good review.", "recommendationid": "35112016", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504890", "timestamp_created": 1506021867, "author": {"num_reviews": 89, "num_games_owned": 254, "playtime_forever": 238, "last_played": 1506021365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 147, "steamid": "76561198008914127"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505753824, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A really good game.
