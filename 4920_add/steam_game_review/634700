The game is published to show the Story,Characters and idea behind it to the public.\n\nThe Story basicly involves the creation of the main character of the next Game Guardi. You start as a Molon (not Moron), You follow several of them to see what there normal day is like but at some point it switches to another person.\n\nThis will let you play as the \"main\" character in this game. Here the whole story is coming up, I wont spoil it tho.\nThe way the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923154519]\"windowed mode\"[/url] is used in the end is great. \n\n[spoiler] If you want to see it ill link it, but if the game interests you you shouldnt. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923154995 [/spoiler]\n\nThe moment you get the intention of this game you will like it.\n\nFor 1,99 you can definitly try this game out. The [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923154543] Art Style [/url] definitly has something to it.

That said, it has surprisingly high production values - awesome visual effects, great music, very interesting characters and setting. \n\nI'd recommend this if it's still $1, but if not, then it's definitely worth checking the forums to see whether they've fixed the bugs & translation shortcomings. I really hope the sequel FLUTONIUM is released in a better state, because they've made such a cool universe and it's just the rough edges that you'd think would be easy to fix that are letting it down.", "recommendationid": "31716554", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510020", "timestamp_created": 1494654510, "author": {"num_reviews": 107, "num_games_owned": 1026, "playtime_forever": 84, "last_played": 1494655151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988004463"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494452336, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 9, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A really good and interesting game.\nHighly recommended.

For all who have negative rating toward this I get it, you thought it was a cool game but it's just a reading game Just give them the time to show whats gonna come up next and think of this as a soundtrack of the sequel thats coming up next its just a dollar not a 4.99 pew pew kapow game.\nFor people who just argues about \"why is windowed mode full screen?\" Just play the game and you will get why.\nBut there are minor issues. Some grammers problems, text out of screen problems, and text skip problems but they are working on it right now. (I checked and not many are found)\nIn long story short, if you want to understand the story of the upcoming sequel game just buy this and play like a interacting novel. If not, just buy the sequel and play the game. :)", "recommendationid": "31775776", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505064", "timestamp_created": 1494879290, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 58, "playtime_forever": 701, "last_played": 1495277707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198263856643"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494550201, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Plutonium is a really unique Concept and Game. It is meant as a Prologue to Flutonium. Some may say it is a mere Demo but dont be scared cuz its way more than that.\nTo create a new brand you have to have a good Idea and this aspiring developer did a great job with that. The Universe he created looks diverse and unique. He drove me into it and I am really interested into what kind of direction Flutonium will evolve. What will happen next. That I am curious about.\nIf it is the concept arts, or the music everything about this game tells me, it is forged with love and creativity.\nThe price is fair also.\n\nNo Idea what you are waiting for. Go for it. The Risk is really low I say and I bet you would be pleasently surprised about Plutonium.", "recommendationid": "31692940", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502934", "timestamp_created": 1494550201, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 250, "playtime_forever": 180, "last_played": 1494549360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006668052"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1494791755, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I kinda like this game.
