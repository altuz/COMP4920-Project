You play as different cultures with their own units, kinda like a real time strategy game, including having gatherers working while you fight, sending units to do battle in the middle of the map while pushing to get to the other end and destroy the opposing enemy. I would compare it to a MOBA in that way, but \"MOBA\" is a four-letter word to some people. Oh wait...\n\nWhere was I? Anywho, the single player campaign is cute and silly, and I had a nice time with it. I played the multiplayer briefly, and it's alright. I won, which was nice, but I don't generally like the stress of competitive gaming, so I'm not interested in continuing that any time soon. I definitely recommend it for the single player, though. This one is all about the gameplay, but it's different enough from most games to stand out on its own and be memorable in a good way."}]}
