I know it's old-fashioned, but if people buy this game with 90% discount, what problem could they have, hah?\n\nYou say the game is unfinished, but I certainly don't think so. Look:\n- You can regulate game audio pretty well with Windows volume mixer for each application individually;\n- There's nothing to change with video - the game is 256x224 4:3 and it's not coming to wide screens because those are the NES screen dimensions;\n- Controls are just fine. If you think of some better customization, just tell me and I'll consider it an option. But, judging by you saying \"Fighting is just pressing the z button\", you didn't get into using spells at all, and completed the game with just one hero class out of three. That's also the reason behing you saying the randomizer is bad - nope, it's just harsh as intended. If you know all the game rules, you can finish any random map. For starters, use the NET spell whenever you encounter the powerful enemy and use the IQ spell if you're a mage with high INT. I know it's not too interesting in 2017, so I don't blame you or anyone else for switching to other games. It's just how things are - I want this game to stay old for the sake of it.\n\nAnd no, I've been to several Ludum Dare jams and I can't agree most of the games are better than that. Maybe 20% of them, OK!\n\nAlso, if you want to try the \"Castle of no Escape 2\" for free, add me to get the free key. It's a totally other Zelda-like game.\n\nThanks for stopping by! :cone_guardian:", "review": "[h1]Oh boy...[/h1]\n\nFirst of all, I don't like it when people review games and only played it for about 20minutes. But in this case I was already through with the whole game after 20minutes.\n\npros\n - graphics are okish\n - 8bit sound\n - randomized level/enemies...\n\ncons\n - for the length of the game the price is ridiculous (I paid only 0.30 because of a 90% coupon)\n - the game is unfinished. There are basic features missing like settings for audio, video or controls and a lot of people seem to have a problem with missing explainations.\n - \"Fighting\" is just pressing the z button\n - the randomizer is very poor, which means if you are unlucky you encounter only strong monsters at the beginning and its basically over\n\nI participated in gameJams where people have 48-72h to develop a game (starting with nothing) and most of the games created in such a jam are better than this. If this is the first game of the developer - ok, good for you. Show it your friends and family and imporve your skills but this game shold not be on steam and definitly not for that price!", "recommendationid": "33723480", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509919", "timestamp_created": 1500737705, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_forever": 23, "last_played": 1500738036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081804585"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499932029, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Hahaha, i think the game is awesome, it takes some tome to figure how it works, but then all is cool.\n\nCleared 4 floors, and in the end lost on moster with 999 hp/str (not sure).\n\nThe game is basic, or you could say old style . \n\n10/10\n\n:D", "recommendationid": "33497666", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493121", "timestamp_created": 1499932029, "author": {"num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 91, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1499931890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037756120"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "7 user reviews", "total_negative": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 7, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
