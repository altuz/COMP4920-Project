We can understand your desire to be tense and scared in such a setting. \nAlso we emphasize the fact that it's a survival game and sometimes loosing several HP with no food in the inventory is much more terrifying than an alien jumping around the corner :)", "review": "Honestly, I would say the single worst part about this game is the enemies.  The mechanics are all there for a fun little game if it just had a different antagonist.  The game even does a pretty solid job setting up the atmosphere.  It's dark, it's cold, you're all alone, and the music and ambience make it sound like something spooky is afoot.  A couple of times, the ambience would play a noise that sounded like something moving around on the map or growling at me.  This would cause me to actually stop and look around the map a little bit because I was genuinely worried something was crawling around outside.  This, of course, was all before I went to sleep for the first time and realized that the enemies are nothing more than a floating basketball with some different textures for different types of enemies.  To call them anti-climatic would be an understatement.  These things are so underwhelming that I find myself just annoyed by their precense rather than scared or concerned that they are there.  Not only that, but these things don't randomly spawn.  You control their spawn by sleeping so it's not like you're constantly scared of their arrival since you know exactly when they'll show up.  This set up makes the game extremely repetitive despite it's randomized nature for every playthrough.\n\n1. Start game\n2. Loot and such until you have to sleep\n3. Sleep and spawn basketball aliens\n4. Deal with said aliens\n5. repeat steps 2-4 until you die or reach end game\n\nI'm not saying they're super easy to defeat or anything so the game can still be challenging. But before I actually knew when the aliens showed up, I was actually scared that they were there the whole time and that they could be hiding behind each door.  I was sending people through a building one door at a time, ready to have them sprint away if something was inside.  I guess what I'm saying is that there's no tension.  At no point am I afriad to just walk into a building all alone.  At no point am I afraid that my survivors might get ambushed.   At no point am I afriad that I could be killed at any moment.  Even when I'm getting cornered and killed by an alien, it's just so anti-climatic and boring.  They just float up to you and... well that's it.  They just float up to you and you slowly lose health.\n\nI don't mean to say that the whole game is bad because I really do think it has all the right stuff to make it an entertaining game for the price.  I just feel that the antagonist of this game falls short.  And since the antagonist of this game is really the core concept, it hurts the entire game for me.", "recommendationid": "35058342", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520341", "timestamp_created": 1505798350, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 206, "playtime_forever": 146, "last_played": 1505879733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198015953187"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504591181, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I am really enjoying the art style of this game, combined with the music it creates an awesome atmosphere, despite me be very bad at this game :)\nAfter about 13 hours of play i still have not made it any further than area 4, i am finding it really hard, but i guess if you really like a challenge than this might be a game for you (or i just suck at this game) :)\nStill the game manages to draw me back in, it is always a suprise what you are going to find or not going to find, things seem to be going great one minute and the next minute everything is going downhill fast.\n\nThere is definitely a bit of a learning curve to this game as it is very unforgiving, a mistake means game over in a lot of cases and that can be frustrating at times.\n", "recommendationid": "34750535", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504064", "timestamp_created": 1504591181, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 404, "playtime_forever": 859, "last_played": 1504594788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993064912"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506766785, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1506665300, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "developer_response": "Dear Hodor <2!\n\nThank you for sharing your opinion with us.
