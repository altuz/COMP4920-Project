The game is on sale, the day after release... Should mean lots of people pick it up.  Problem is, Hellblade also launched today... \n\nWell... I am a huge fan of this Genre... being \"metroid-vania\" if that's how they are classifying this.  \n\nI don't feel like it is much of a Metroidvania game.  Aside from your starting area having a ship crashed into the ground, and being a chick in a suit, I don't feel the Metroid influence.  I don't really see the Castlevania influence much either.  Combined, they both offer something truly amazing... this game misses both the mark on the gunplay, and the swordplay.\n\nGraphically, it looks pretty dang great.  But the optimization is horrible.  This game should be running 1080p 60fps on most systems.  On my system, similar games like Strider, and Shadow Complex, run silky smooth... This game is hitting 25 fps at Lower resolution, and the more I play the game, the worse it seems to run.\n\nAt its core, the game could be fun, if it stopped holding your hand so much, and the enemies had some sort of reasonable health.  Instead you spend 30 seconds killing a small mob that eats almost all your health.  \n\nDodging, does not work well.  Insta-death during exploration is common.  Skill tree expansion is not great.  Voice acting seems to be done by the same person for all characters, by someone with a cleft palette and a cracked front tooth.  \n\nI can understand that this is an indie budget game, and that there had to be some point where the game actually released.  My opinion, is that there should have been someone from outside the group, that had an unbiased opinion about how polished the game is.\n\nAs of now, I still recommend the game, because it is certainly decent, but if they do not decide to clean it up, I would recommend playing something else...", "recommendationid": "34115109", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507834", "timestamp_created": 1502239364, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 90, "playtime_forever": 188, "last_played": 1502236489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139614545"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503872526, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Simple and fun\n\nFor a 17$ game, it lives up to it's name, it's not exactly a metroidvania, but who cares.

The artstyle and how the animations look are solid and it's one of the better looking 2.5d games I've seen which is why I decided to give it a try. The sound track wasn't too notable but no complaints there either. \n-The biggest problem was the english voice acting. The translations aren't even the problem with it (despite being terrible). My biggest complaint is how every voice seems so out of place with Lachesis being the only exception. The Intelligent globe sounded really awkward and every character in the cave and first town sounded like they were just some random people you found and told to read some lines. They lacked character, enthusiasm, and was so off putting I was actually considering changing to chinese to avoid it (ended up quitting the game instead)\n\nGameplay: \n-The way the character moves is a little clunky but overall wasnt too bad. I prefer fluidity in games when transitioning from attacking to moving. When trying to jump and attack or just try to move around while shooting there are brief pause between each animation you could see and feel. nothing too bad but might consider looking into in future games.\n-My favorite part for the brief time I had with the game was the level up customization options in the game. It added a cool layer of freedom on how you could progress through the game and actually made me pretty excited on the possibilities it could open up through movement, attacks, and overall builds but was cut short by the real problem I had with it \n-The biggest problem and why I put \"metroidvania\" is the game holds your hand and you have a set path the entire time. None of the paths you encounter branch out to any other areas. It was so linear I felt like I was just progressing through a cutscene not actually exploring anything. The reason I prefer metroivania games over most genres is the freedom you get exploring the world the game creates for you. I never got that from the game and it felt so boring that all the cool customization and movement mechanics seemed like they were for nothing. \n\nI only played it for a brief moment (~1 hour) so take that into consideration but that wasn't enough to hold my attention and showed some flaws I couldn't get past. If it does eventually get better exploration wise having an hour long linear \"intro\" is way more than I could handle\n\n5/10 would not recommend", "recommendationid": "34206463", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430924", "timestamp_created": 1502600886, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 47, "last_played": 1502227295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197999332287"}, "votes_up": 8}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 15, "total_reviews": 24, "total_positive": 19, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
