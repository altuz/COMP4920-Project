Even then in its early stages, I thought the game was pretty good and that it had a lot of potential if the devs decided to make it better. I've played it on and off in the following time, watching the game continue to improve and grow. Years later, the developers have created this PC version, which is a port from the mobile version with minor differences. As a relatively seasoned player, CarX Drift Racing is one of the better drift games around in my honest opinion. Here's why.\n\nIf you're a completely new player, the game is relatively easy to get into. If you play other racing games, especially other drift games, you should have no problem getting into CarX Drift Racing. The game has keyboard/mouse support as well as controller and wheel support (not sure if there's force feedback or not yet), meaning that you have a range of options for you to choose for input.\n\nWhen you start off in the game, you barely have enough money to buy Class 1 (C1) cars. After buying your first car, it will be stock and you will not have enough money for a tuning or paint, so you will have to try the car in a quick race. You can choose from Training to Time Attack races to Drift races to online lobbies. As you complete more races and earn coins and XP, you will be able to level up and unlock more customizations and tunings for each car. You are able to change your car's base paint, rim paint, window tint, smoke color, and engine tuning. There are 5 classes of cars, C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5. The higher the class a car is, the larger coin multiplier it will have in races (i.e. C5 cars have a x5 multiplier whilst C2 cars have a x2 multiplier).\n\nFor players returning from the mobile version, CarX Drift Racing is still mostly the same game that we all know and love. Not much has changed, as this is a port with minor differences. The physics are the same, the cars are the same, the tracks are the same, etc. If you were a fan of the mobile version, I would highly recommend getting this for a better, PC-oriented experience if you're considering.\n\nThere are a few small changes I have noticed (based on iOS version):\n- No microtransactions / secondary currency (well the game is $8.99 USD so I would hope there would be none)\n- Drift races have a somewhat different points system\n- Even more settings for graphics, controls, etc.\n\nOverall, I believe CarX Drift Racing is an entertaining drift game that anyone can get into, whether it's a player that has been drifting in the game for years or someone who wants to try a new racing game. It's generally a laid back and easy game (also makes for a great time killer) and the grind for cars and tracks is not prevalent until much later into the game. I would recommend it to anyone willing to try a new drift game and any older players considering getting this version on PC. I've had fun playing the game for the past few years and I'm happy for it to be on PC, where it could potentially become even greater.", "recommendationid": "35056667", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506482", "timestamp_created": 1505788663, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 54, "playtime_forever": 435, "last_played": 1506598838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "steamid": "76561198324587074"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505919125, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i see a kid growing up with this game, that is just how good it is , it's perfect :D", "recommendationid": "35085552", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505919125, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 5122, "last_played": 1507152180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 656, "steamid": "76561198335333779"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506067375, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "CarX drift, what can i say? do i need to say anything? if you dont have this game already wtf are you doing.
