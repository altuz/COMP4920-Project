There is no mention on the store page whether the next episodes are included in the price or not.\n\nIf the price was a tenth of what it is I would have kept it.\n\nAsked for a refund, but It'll stay on my wishlist and I'll re-purchase it when and if all episodes are released and a bundle is on offer.", "recommendationid": "34089129", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505766", "timestamp_created": 1502137993, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 636, "playtime_forever": 22, "last_played": 1502137114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987787130"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
