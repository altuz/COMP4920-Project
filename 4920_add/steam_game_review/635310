You have different locations to choose from and each comes with its own tasks (5 headshots, 8 hits in a row and so on). With each guy you snipe and each task you complete you earn money to unlock weapons and pills. The pills can be used to slow down time to hit more accurate. Some have a higher total duration but shorter slow motion - you get the idea.\n\nI was able to 100% this game in just above 4 hours. It's a fun little timewaster while you are waiting for a Steam download to complete and you can progress in short sessions. Despite the trashy feel Ski Sniper offers solid programming and I didn't encounter any bugs. There is a sense of progression and the difficulty level is balanced. It actually got me thinking a few times how to hit the right spots, considering my viewpoint, the angle of the guy and the relating position of his organs.\n\nIs it worth 5 bucks? No. Should you get it on a sale? Only if you like cheap silly games to kill time. Do you have to feel ashamed for buying and playing it?
