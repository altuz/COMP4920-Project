That's what they did with the song \"Drive Home\" (from the 2013 album \"The Raven That Refused To Sing - And Other Stories\") in order to bring \"Last Day Of June\" to life.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who's really into music, if you're someone who would take its time appart with the sole purpose of enjoying a new album, and, literaly listening to it, you'll easily catch what this game is about.\n\n\n\nPROS:\n- Catchy.\n- Emotional.\n- Atmospheric.\n- Trippy.\n- Really colourful.\n- Music by Steven Wilson.\n\nCONS:\n- Kleenex tissues not included.\n- A little bit repetitive in some parts.\n", "recommendationid": "34769833", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534144", "timestamp_created": 1504675128, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 992, "playtime_forever": 910, "last_played": 1504969750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025178380"}, "votes_up": 19}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504745223, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've played video games for the majority of my 30 years of existence.

The one that's mechanics intrigued me, that challenged me, that made me slowlly take my time and try to savor each scene.\n\nAlthough it may have it's own flaws, when it stands strong and proud it outshines any gripe I may have had. The story takes twists that I didn't see coming, made me care and connect with clay people with no eyes -- the same ones who display some of the best traits and signs of emotion.\n\nIf you are even remotely interested in this game, turn away from this review now. Don't read anything else. Put on some headphones, turn down the lights and just let this short (~4.5 hour game) make you run the gamut of emotions.\n\nLast Day of June tells a complex story but one that doesn't leave pointless ends loose or show any sign of being pretentious or \"heady\". I can honestly say, from the bottom of my heart, this game is a top 3 and candidate for GOTY.

Trigger and relive memories and then rewind the day.\n\nAltering mundane but significant details enables new perspectives. Go back again to undo previous changes for yet different outcomes. Designers did a great job of shortening the process by not resetting the simpler completed tasks, conveniently avoiding most of the tediousness of repetition.\n\nFixing timelines is more about solving the story's main conundrum rather than crafting a personalized narrative. There is only one solution and one final ending. Dealing with time travel almost invariably incurs implausible circumstances in other fiction but writers here successfully avoided that pitfall entirely.\n\nThe game features a great selection of some of Steven Wilson's more accessible songs in mostly instrumental versions. It is a delight to appreciate his evocative music in interactive fiction, here perfectly fitting the theme and story, without stealing the spotlight.\n\nCharacters speak in gibberish voices of uneven quality and often exaggerated tones, perhaps unsurprisingly voiced by the developers themselves.
