I usually dislike games in this genre when they have too much downtime but Emporium had a very stimulating progression. I have to compliment developer on having a very consistent tone between dialogue, metaphorical visuals, and sound.  It takes about 1 hour to get 100% completion which included 2 endings. Although it is a short game it had enough time to deliver the narrative and make an emotional impact. Personally, I think it one of the best walking simulators at a very insulting price. Then again it seems like no matter how good a game in this genre is, it can't please everyone. Why buy a walking simulator to complain that it does not have things to do?\n\n[b] Aesthetic.[/b] I really love the use of metaphorical imagery. Every plot point has a location associated with it that helps in setting up the atmosphere. There is a good amount of psychological effects like surreal events and unrealistic structures. Even the camera use was done in a way that complemented the mood. Although I really wish I could zoom in and out manually to appreciate the environment more. Overall I think the game looks fantastic, especially those light effects that create shadows. \n\n [b]Dialogue.[/b] The narrative was somewhat vague which is okey because it leaves just enough breadcrumbs to wonder about what really happened. Throughout the game, you get a couple text choices which change other text lines down the road. Each choice seems to have an object associated with it that spawns in specific areas. The format of the game has a bit of a cycling effect where you go through the same area multiple times while things change. You definitely want to play the game twice to get as much story as possible. I thought it was handled well and I most of us can relate to the character.\n\n[b]Use of ambiance and sound effects. [/b] It is worth noting how well the \"music\" or the lack of was used. Most of the areas have very ambient score almost fitting for a horror game. Sound effects were also well placed to create themes. Like there are no people in the office but you can hear them talking (which is a psychological focus only on the main character)\n\n [h1] Final Thoughts 8/10 [/h1] I would have to be pretty ignorant to ignore how much attention to detail went into making this experience (cough, cough). Emporium really nailed the atmosphere and creating immersive settings. It would be pretty hard to make a good argument against it at $5, let alone $1. It just comes down to loving or hating walking simulators in general. My only nitpicks are lack of manual zoom and small text (which is completely tolerable) Definitely one of the better games in the genre, at least from those that I played.", "recommendationid": "34763905", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512070", "timestamp_created": 1504642665, "author": {"num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "playtime_forever": 76, "last_played": 1504721294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 47, "total_positive": 38, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
