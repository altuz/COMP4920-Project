It follows the story of Kai and Renee, glimpsing small snippets of their lives as you walk through a forest and climb a mountain. The language is extremely poetic and flowery. I enjoyed the writing, but it certainly won't be to everyone's taste. The narrator has a soothing voice and excellent articulation and subtitles are also available. Whilst the story concept is moving, it's relatively simple and requires you to be emotionally connected to it. Deep philosophically, the details given in the game are very sparse.\n\nVisually appealing, graphics are good - very attractive and very detailed. There are some screenshots on my website; but the store page shows off the graphical detail very well and accurately. This really is the strength of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is virtually non existent - I would not mistake this for an \"adventure\" game. It is pure walking simulator and the walking pace, even at its fastest is snail-slow. It needs to be for the narration and music to work, as it's heavily triggered by location, but it does get a bit tiring just pushing W for the entire game. There are a couple of interactive elements but not enough to make mention of (just walk up to something and interact with it to trigger the next scene). You can jump, but the \"platforming\" elements which are jumping over a few rocks and going up some stairs are sluggish and hard to control. I'm very glad there wasn't more platforming, as in the final chapter one set of stairs took me 5 attempts as I kept slipping down no matter how hard I jammed space and that really damaged my immersion. \n\nThere are a couple of options for narration choice in between each chapter; but they are very simple and alter a small snippet of text you receive after, having no real bearing on the story.\n\nAlthough it looks great - this fell flat for me on the whole, even as an experience rather than a game. The writing may have been poetic and philosophical and I enjoyed the narration, but it didn't tie the story together or make me care about the world or the characters in it. Even the personal sequences felt slightly jarring, short and the choices unimportant. I have experienced love and loss and I understood the emotions that this game were attempting to invoke, but the slow walking speed and the clumsy movement detracted from feeling immersed in that.\n\nIt took me 62 minutes to complete. It's a 7GB download and has a \u00a36.99 price tag, so I'm heavily questioning the value of the game. If you fancy spending an hour walking through a lovely forest with some poetric voice-overs than this game may well be for you but even for lovers of the walking simulator genre, I think there are many better games out there. Perhaps heavily discounted I'd feel better about a recommendation; but as it is, I'm unconvinced.\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665 If you're a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

Even running on my 1080 Ti, the game had significant framerate issues, and there is pop-in literally everywhere you turn, even within the title screen. That said, the narrator did a phenomenal job and should be commended, as did the musician. However, even those were implemented poorly and there were multiple moments where the music drowned out the narrator and I could not make out what he was saying.\n\nAt 45 minutes, this walking simulator offers extremely poor value for it's $10 asking price and is not even a game, except only by the very loosest of definitions.", "recommendationid": "35038695", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531122", "timestamp_created": 1505708490, "author": {"num_reviews": 174, "num_games_owned": 427, "playtime_forever": 71, "last_played": 1505705460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030863487"}, "votes_up": 18}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505574074, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Yep, another walking sim. Good thing I like 'em, eh? Let's make this review easy on myself, and just do one o' them list thingamejigs:\n\nGraphics: Good, but not amazing. Nothing exceptional, given the genre. Has its moments, but not consistently gob-smacking by any stretch. Some nice watery reflections.\n\nSound: Good atmos. Again, not exceptional, but good.\n\nMusic: Very nice. Occasionally epic.\n\nVoice acting: Excellent. Though it is a bit quiet in the mix at times, especially towards the end. Though that's obviously not the voice actor's fault.\n\nWriting: Um...yeah. Pretty good, but a bit new-agey for my tastes. Depends what you're looking for. Strong story? Not really, though the end is surprisingly moving. Evocative mumbo-jumbo? Sure, plenty of that. I've heard better, and I've definitely heard worse. (There's also some attempts at short \"interactive fiction\" between Chapters, but I'm not convinced it added anything to the game. Just broke the immersion of the first person format, mostly.)\n\nLevel design/mapping: A bit strange and unnecessarily \"narrow\" at times; you often feel like you're walking through tight corridors, even when you're outdoors. I personally prefer my walking sim worlds to feel a bit more \"open\" (even when they are, in fact, quite linear). \n\nGameplay: What, are you kidding? It's a walking simulator! Okay, so there's a couple of simple interactive \"puzzles\", like rebalancing logs and pushing over rocks to walk across, but nothing that will titillate the frag-happy masses. There's also a bit more jumping than is typical in walking sims; a good thing, perhaps, unless you feel that having a \"jump\" button in such a game can verge on the silly side at times. Me, I'm fifty-fifty on the subject. Each to their own.\n\nWalking Speed: Slow. Even with the \"sprint\" (aka \"slightly faster walk\") button held down. Could definitely be a mite faster.\n\nLength: Short, as you'd expect. An hour, maybe a tad more. But apt, given the story being told.\n\nPrice: A tad baffling, given the market and the competition. Better off nearer to the five dollar mark. Definitely not worth as much as Dear Esther, whose price it currently equals.\n\nConclusion:  A good'un, but not a great'un. Hard to argue that it pushes this genre of gaming forward, but it doesn't hurl it backwards, either.  An urgent purchase for none bar the most die-hard of \"walking\" addicts; for everyone else, I'd at least wait for that price to come down.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.", "recommendationid": "34900939", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526899", "timestamp_created": 1505222448, "author": {"num_reviews": 429, "num_games_owned": 1513, "playtime_forever": 91, "last_played": 1505221332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048974498"}, "votes_up": 14}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506528227, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "There\u2019s been some debate within the gaming community surrounding the definition of a \u201cgame.\u201d For some, games need to have a degree of actual gameplay involved to be classified as more than just \u201cexperiences.\u201d For others, games are purely a form of art, and as long as there\u2019s even minimal player input something can qualify as a game.\u00a0At the heart of this debate are \u201cwalking simulators,\u201d a somewhat recent genre of game that has players walk around different areas and interact with objects without any real win/loss conditions or traditional gameplay elements.\n\nReaching for Petals falls into this genre seamlessly. For better and for worse, this game is indeed a walking sim; players will spend almost all of their time walking through beautifully-detailed environments and occasionally performing the\u2026odd jump here and there? It\u2019s strange to fathom why a walking sim would need a jump button in the first place, and it ends up leading to several immersion-breaking instances. Not in the exact perfect the spot? Don\u2019t expect to make the jump. It\u2019s spotty and feels like it was included to add to the hiking aspect of the game, but instead, ends up providing the only moments of frustration in it.\n\nOn the positive side, Petals\u2019 greatest strength is undeniably its presentation. There are few games that lend themselves to gorgeous screenshots as well as this one. Forests are rendered in lush detail, sunsets look absolutely breathtaking, and pretty lighting effects do well to immerse the player and give the whole experience a dreamy, yet realistic feel. I did encounter some minor pop-in and texture issues during my time with the game, but it was hardly enough to detract from the overall experience.\n\nPerhaps even more gorgeous, however, is Petals\u2019 score. Composer Gustavo Coutinho thoroughly succeeds at creating a subtle yet expansive soundscape that lends itself perfectly to each of the game\u2019s environments. Music swells and ebbs perfectly with key moments throughout and gradually builds to a startling treat of a listen in the final chapter. Poor environmental sound design bogs things down a bit, but the soundtrack for this one is a clear winner.\n\nThe story of Reaching for Petals is half told through a stellar narrator and half read by the player in short memory sequences. Players take control of Kai as he embarks on a hike and muses over themes like love, loss, memories and the meaning of life itself. It\u2019s a quite somber tale that\u2019s not particularly well-articulated through the game\u2019s writing. Rather, the narrator\u2019s philosophical and poetical ramblings (which, again, are voiced incredibly well), environmental effects and swelling ambient soundtrack work together quite effectively to make the player feel the weight of the journey. Unfortunately, by the time the credits rolled I was ultimately left with something that felt heavy but empty, seemingly meaningful but without any real way to connect the dots.\n\nHerein lies what is perhaps Petals\u2019\u00a0greatest downfall: it\u2019s incredibly presumptuous, self-important tone. For as well as the lines are delivered, most of the game\u2019s introspective musings are nothing but poetical fluff. One of the key purposes of philosophy is to seek truth and get to the core of some of life\u2019s greatest questions. Petals tries to accomplish this but simultaneously tries to make this process sound as heady and needlessly fanciful as possible. It\u2019s rare to hear an insight in this game and not think to yourself \u201cWow, that sounded lovely\u2026but what\u2019s he getting at?\u201d This only shows signs of clearing up towards the game\u2019s final moments, and by then the player is left with more feelings than answers.\n\nSo, should you give Reaching for Petals a chance? In the end, it all comes down to what you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re simply in search of something aesthetically pleasing, I think you\u2019ll find a lot to like here.
