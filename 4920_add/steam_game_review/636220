It's a great puzzle game to show off to people who have never seen VR before, but is complex enough to have infinite replay value. I got to play a beta version of this game before it was available, and as a result, bought it. The lower levels are fantastic no stress puzzles, ramping up in intensity the more you play. Each level is also quick, so you can have friends over and easily take turns playing together.", "recommendationid": "35471038", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1507122874, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 160, "playtime_forever": 7, "last_played": 1507122836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "steamid": "76561197970366280"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507046759, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I really liked this game. It's uniquely VR title and a puzzle game - kinda like Tetris but in VR. The first few levels were very easy and just required matching blocks. As the game progressed into the second and thrid environments, it added more complexity including a throwing game and special power ups that made it fun and replayable.  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a non-shoorter VR game.", "recommendationid": "35450705", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1507046759, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 244, "playtime_forever": 288, "last_played": 1507046815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198030793294"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
