The Miller Brothers were intent to create games that were not violent and suitable for children by concentrating on the core theme of exploration. Each game had a unique spider web type layout which when clicked on would take you to another type of world and it's easy to see when you play such games how the evolution of this process eventually helped spawn the concept behind Myst.\n\nThere is no end goal, or achievements and so the objective is to simply explore and see what secrets you can find. Problem is though that without achievements it\u2019s really difficult to ever say whether or not you have actually found all the secrets and other than the phone numbers suggesting 9 characters in the world of 'manhole' there is no other way of keeping track. \n\nExploration games are a really unique market and very seldom ever appear. Two of which I have come across really brought out the kid in my heart and beckoned me to explore. Those two games were 'Botanicula' and 'Windosill', however such a thing never happened for me when it came to 'The Manhole'. Why? Well for one thing regardless of the new title of it being called a 'masterpiece' reminiscent to that same title being given to Myst when the graphics were updated to HD, such is not the case here. It's simply been ported keeping its low resolution. The viewing area where the graphics play out is also a very small window. The sound and music conversion is quite appalling and there are a lot of bugs also which have been carried through. Simply click your mouse while an animation plays out and more often than not the game will crash.\n\nTwo Easter eggs have been added. One is a reference to Osmo their second game and also the documentary of the making of myst which was originally presented on the cd rom of Myst and here too it is even displayed in a smaller viewing area about the size of a Australian 20 cent piece which make the whole thing indutably irrelevant. For those that want to see this making I strongly suggest just watching it on youtube instead.\n\nWhile its sent many gamers down memory lane resulting in a dozens of thumbs up ratings, personally I would have much preferred if the Miller brothers had taken their time, brought this heritage really to life with crisp high resolution graphics and added achievements for an extra added encouragement to carefully explore.\n\nBugged, Low res, no achieves, terrible music. Personally I suggest waiting for the 'Indutably Extra Hyper Complex Hyper Super Dooper Masterpiece Edition'. Curiosity settled below...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rRzHehNpnQE"}]}
