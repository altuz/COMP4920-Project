I have followed this game since its debut on the greenlight page, and I have been waiting for this game's release for quite some time. The soundtrack is very good, and the gameplay is very smooth (Most of the time). The game is rather hard in its later levels, but if you are a fan of rhythm games and/or super meat boy like games, then this is the game for you.\nMy only downside to this game is the fact that the controls can sometimes be a bit delayed, which can be very annoying at times where timing it key. Not only that, but sometimes I can't jump, which might be a problem with my controller, or just a mechanic in the game. Eitherway, my rating for this game is still the same! 8/10!\n\nEDIT: Some how, this game made me feel emotions for blocks with numbers on them. Well played game.", "recommendationid": "35073789", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1505862353, "author": {"num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 193, "playtime_forever": 256, "last_played": 1506985408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "steamid": "76561198085490305"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
