They have a good system that encourages you to replay the levels and there is an overarching narrative that pushes the story forward. The story is probably the weakest element of the game but it's still thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nIn terms of length, Almost 2 hours in and I just barely completed the first of 3 episodes at the time of this review, for 10 bucks it's a steal.\n\nTo the devs, keep up the good work.", "recommendationid": "34880869", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505128908, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 215, "playtime_forever": 99, "last_played": 1505074824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035947054"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 15, "total_positive": 13, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
