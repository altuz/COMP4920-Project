It's a small area to point and click around. There are a few toys to play with (simple animation studios, a music sequencer, a couple simple physics demos). There's a lot click a nose on a face and it will turn into different kinds of noses or click a picture on the wall to make a sound effect like Humongous Entertainment games.\n\nMy two favorite things are the sound demos. One shows a rock falling down a hole and how long it takes the sound to bounce back up. The other shows lightning at various distances and how long it takes the sound to reach you. You can see everything in about a half hour and that's if you're really trying to experience everything. There is a short book in the game with backstory that would probably double that length.\n\nAlso, as someone else said, don't forget to click the fire."}]}
