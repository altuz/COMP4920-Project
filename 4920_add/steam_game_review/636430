The graphics are sweet and nice but that doesn't mount to anthing when the game is boring as hell and the gun sounds are all the same. \n\nThe gun sounds- every gun, the assault rifle, the M9 and the .44 Magnum are all the same sound. There is no difference between them and that is lazy as hell. \n\nThe Modes- there are three modes to the game. Easy modes basically is where you have to kill 100 zombies, normal is 200 and hard is 300 ranked. 300 Ranked is to see how far you can get before diying but it won't matter becaise you have unlimited ammo.\n\nForced Dual Wielding- why are players forced to duel wield the weapons? That's aming players over powered as hell and also allowing auto-reload.\n\nRelaoding Machanic- the reload is just pushing the top button and the guns relaod automatically...why give zombie players a challenge. Make them reload the guns manually.\n\nZombies- the zombies are jump scary worthy if your not paying attention but their A.I. is so predictable that players don't even have to aim down sights.\n\nMaps- there are two maps but the second map is the same map but with out the building, so basically your outside...that is super lazy. There was no point to the second map at all if it's just a reskin of the first one. \n\nI am sorry but this game got boring to quickly and is to easy even on the hardest difficulty.  The game is basically good on graphics but everything else it falses hardcore. Zombie Kill gets a 2/10. It would have gotten a 1/10 but the inter mission jump scare kept it from being 1. I can't recommend this game.\n\nThat's the pony review", "recommendationid": "33390907", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "timestamp_created": 1499564034, "author": {"num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 186, "playtime_forever": 21, "last_played": 1499170679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198186133689"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
