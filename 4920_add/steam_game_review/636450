Well, this is one of those games that you can't get the full experience just by seeing. You need to put your headphones on and play with a controller (with vibration) to 'get' it.\nIt's a bit of a hard sell.\n\nNote that this is an [u] arcade styled game. [/u] Shooting down maximum possible enemies, collecting as much powerups as possible and getting a high score is the core game. You can complete all the stages of the main game in about 3/3.5 hours. There is a score attack mode and a \"beyond\" mode, which a challenge set.\nAlso, there is the techno music. If you don't like this style of music, this will be a much harder sell.\n\nHowever, [b] there is nothing quite like it. [/b] Yes, it's 3 hours long, but those could be the most thrilling 3 hours of your life. The feeling of [b] synesthesia [/b] it creates is amazing. And don't think this is some pseudo-artsy thing, this is a challenging video game. The level of difficulty grows with each stage, with the final stage (Area 5) being an epic showdown.\nHell, I'd say the price is worth Area 5 alone, one of the best final stages I've every experienced.\n\nTL;DR = If you are skeptical, then I suggest to [u] wait for sale.

Seeing the game all around me with proper scale has been one of my favorite reasons to own a Vive.\n\nTo anyone who doesn't know, Rez is a rail 3D shooter - where player controls shooting and camera.  Rez is very strait forward, but rewards with incredible presentation that has really lasted the test of time.\n\nThe beauty of Rez is its environment built on largly vector graphics, amazing music and sound effects.  The music and gamplay play in tandem, and Rez could also be described as a music genre game - probably more a music shooter.  There isn't a ton of content unless you love replaying the levels and trying improve scores or climb online rankings.  I consider Rez to be one of the more artistic games ever released.  I also consider Rez one of my all time favorite shooters and fav video games in general.  I've owned it on Dreamcast, PS2, XB360 and now PC - and played the heck out of each version.\n\nI am overjoyed to play it on Vive, but this release begs the question - Where the hell are all the great new VR games?  This game does a lot with VR and its super fun... but it's over 15 years old?  and it instantly became one of my top 5 VR games? \n\nLastly, this game proves that a handful of games can really make the transition to VR in grand fashion, and I wouldn't mind playing remastered versions of the Sega Panzer Dragoon games in VR.", "recommendationid": "34945749", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497962", "timestamp_created": 1505384029, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_forever": 163, "last_played": 1505381610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041226378"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506579168, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "you can get high playing this video game.", "recommendationid": "35255711", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500035", "timestamp_created": 1506579168, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 1011, "playtime_forever": 230, "last_played": 1506749014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 115, "steamid": "76561197992683593"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505161340, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 25, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This game is NOT what it sells itself to be.
