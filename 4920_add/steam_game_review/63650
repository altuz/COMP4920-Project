Sometimes the answer seems obviuos and sometimes it is obsure and make 0 sense and thats just the main game. The DLC is X10 harder. Though the one  redeaming fatcor is you don't have to be a rocket scientest to solve the puzzles(sometimes) just stop and think what is the simplest solutin to this problem. I think what hangs people up the most is over thinking the puzzle and they miss the obviuos.\nOn another note, The main story is told in a diffrent way. Sometime directly with words from notes or pictrues and somtimes with the visuals and the enviroment. Problay the greatest thing that Uru did was allow you to countiue the story and forge a new story online and though the online scene may be dead, I think it is still cool that its there.I mean how many games out there let you, after you come to the end of the main story, give you the pen and paper and let you countie writing.\nNow this game is not without flaws. There are variuos aspects that gets under my skin and everybody gets annoyed at diffrent things but I think they are bearable. That being said this game is not for everyone.  Don't get this game first. Get the first Myst and if you hate that then don't get this game. Also I would highly suggest to try to not use walkthoughs unless you really friggin have to. If you bought the game and you use the walkthrough through out the whole game you would have been better of to save your money and just read the walkthrough and whatch a couple of youtube videos.\n\n\n Now, is this a great game? Yes. Should you get it? That depends if you like hard complecated puzzles that require you to think out of the box."}]}
