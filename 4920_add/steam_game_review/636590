It seems like such a good concept. In fact, there are a few things that work well.\n\nThe little kitchen is pretty well laid out. It's spacious enough and has everything you need. I'd like to see them take advantage of more (the plates, the bottles, etc.). So many things can be grabbed, it's a shame they're not all involved in gameplay.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Concept. Oh with a little more development this is going to be a great game, I can tell.\n- Music. So genki.\n- The price! $9.99 should be the target for games in this scope, so good on them for that.\n- Variety of recipes. Could be better, but it's good enough to get this game going.\n\nTHE BAD\n- Controls. Your hands aren't positioned on the controller, but on the TIP of the controller, so they're too far forward. Instead of feeling like you're grabbing things, it feel like you're grabbing things with a doll's arm held in your hand. Also, the hands are seriously tiny (We're talking Donald Trump levels of tiny hands, here). Pickup detection is buggy. I felt like the game's difficulty was about right, but the game would actually be too easy if the controls worked properly.\n- Sound effects. Ugh, the sound effect for the door opening and closing is just obnoxious.\n- Your sushi shop. That's some seriously bad decorating.\n- Shooting sushi into the buddha's mouth. This is just horrid. It's cute the first time and provided a little breakup to the gameplay, but it happens SO frequently. Game performance tends to stutter and suffer during this part, as well. Like in VR Diner Duo, I want to play a cooking game, not a shooter. This needs desperately to be removed from the game or minimized quite a lot.\n- Limited gameplay. Start game, start serving sushi. That's really it. No levels, no changes in difficulty that I can see.\n\nThis is frustrating for me because I can just see the potential in this game. With a little love and further development, this will be a great game at a great price. It just wasn't ready for prime time, though. This game should have gone to early access or had a few more beta testers for the development process. I will probably return it and come back if they keep up with content and updates to improve the faults in this game.", "recommendationid": "32207935", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538536", "timestamp_created": 1496695863, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 275, "playtime_forever": 25, "last_played": 1496702214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004313277"}, "votes_up": 17}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
