Get a different version.\n\nI had a terrible problem with this game. The game's video playback was broken, but there is no warning or indication about this when the game runs, it simply fails to play video where it should and otherwise it seems like the game is working \"normally\". Because this is a game about mystery and experimentation, there is really no way to know that it is not working as intended. THIS BECAME AN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE. A puzzle game where all the hints are broken.\n\nEventually I discovered that the video problem can be fixed by running the game as an administrator, but the game begins randomly crashing. At any rate I find it totally unacceptable that I had to watch a walkthrough video to realize the game wasn't working as intended.\n\nThe best solution seems to be to download ScummVM and use that to play the game (point it at \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Myst Masterpiece\"). This runs mostly fine (with a few minor audio issues) but at least I finally got to play through the game.\n\nOne additional problem, a note you find in the game with instructions (critical to completing the game) has a typo, where it says \"off\" instead of \"on\". Bizarre! I'm really astounded by how badly this version is put together.\n\nAnyhow, Myst is an interesting game with an important place in history. I think it's worth playing, but I strongly dislike how poorly it is packaged here."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503435589, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496359", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34423985", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_reviews": 1973, "last_played": 1503435586, "num_games_owned": 4956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1503435589, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Tags: Adveture - WC - Walking Clicker\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: This version is obsolete and unstable. Get the latest version here instead\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/244430/realMyst_Masterpiece_Edition/ \n\nThis is probably the closest thing to the retro classic experience delivered in a stable and playable format. Personally I find the clicker interface with slideshow and no transition animations to be jarring to navigate. You have to click around way too much to turn your character and engage in a path. Just to get to the small boat up the hill you gotta click 25 times and you have so many chances of screwing up. Whereas in realmyst you can just walk there and it takes a second. RealMyst:Materpiece edition is a hybrid and has a clicker interface but at least shows transition animation so you can mentally map things out. As such I consider this to be the completely redundant and I am removing it from library for declutter."}]}
