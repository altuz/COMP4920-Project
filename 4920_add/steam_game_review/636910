Reminded me of some older games for the nostalgia factor in terms of movement.This game isn't perfect because I feel like the movement could have been optimized better and there could have been some really fast paced and chaotic levels to spice things but it has a lot to offer and different styles of levels that kept my mind going all the way through. I had a lot of fun finding ways to skip and break the level to get lower times or just see what I could get away with. My favorite level was definitely Moon but again every level had something to offer in its own way. The checkpoint system is also really generous and many developers overlook this in quite a few platformers.", "recommendationid": "34450923", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503530", "timestamp_created": 1503541123, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 135, "playtime_forever": 1821, "last_played": 1505767355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054263476"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499637705, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is amazing. It does the perfect job of capturing the memories from older games like marble blast while also adding new things to keep the level design modern and fresh.
