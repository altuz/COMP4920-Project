You have to protect your city by killing waves of medieval soldiers and warriors. There's a magic skill tree that you can use to strategize your fights. After each chapter you get bosses. Once your gate is down, and enemies run in you lose the level.\n\nThe game doesn't have a tutorial, but starts you right away with a helper line to get you used to the bow / aiming mechanic. To me it worked pretty great after doing the first levels. \n\nThere are already a lot of levels to play, which is nice for an indie early access game. There are some bugs here and there still, like sometimes the game starts without my \"consent\" and then I have to restart the game to make it start the right way. But as its an early access I'll assume all bugs will be fixed.\n\nI like that the game can get quite challenging and exhausting. Even in the \"normal\" game mode. It's definitely a pick up and play game that you can play if you don't have a lot of time, but do want to get a level done before leaving.\n\nI'd recommend to try out the demo to see if you like the game before buying. For this price I think its a cool archery experience.", "recommendationid": "33056509", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505533", "timestamp_created": 1498858069, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 161, "playtime_forever": 72, "last_played": 1498493692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198158809624"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496897889, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have recently purchased Vive and Really enjoyed the \u2018Longbow\u2019.\nThere are many archery games out there, however many of them were looked old school graphics like early 2000s, and those games were not persuasive enough to put 1.5lb HMD on my head.\nI\u2019ve read about reviews and discussions, mostly there were talking about aiming and arrow. I have tried a demo before purchase, for me it was okay to play. Might be these problems are resolved recently? So far, i\u2019m enjoying this game without serious problem.\n\nPros\n- Good graphics\n- Liked hitting effects.\n- Magic arrows, it feels me like a god of archery.\n- Different class of enemies, (Shooting horseman is quite challenging but exciting.)\n\nCons\n- Playtime is kinda short. I know this is Early Access, speed up devs...\n- Play is kind of repetitive.\n- This game should have better explanation about skills, i didn\u2019t know how to activate it until first 15 mins, plus dev should consider to adding some active skills.\n\nOverall this game is 7.5/10 so far, Definitely needs some updates.\n", "recommendationid": "32261273", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "timestamp_created": 1496897889, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 56, "last_played": 1496873568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197986343942"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497491466, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Like this game.\n+ Price seems reasonable\n+ Demo is gut\n+ Boss level is kind of fun\n+ Bow mechanic is not bad\n+ Avoiding enemy's makes me workout\n\n\n- Want to see more stages\n- Multi-player? someday?\n- Show me improvement on skill system, it's fine now but it could be best.", "recommendationid": "32421840", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1497491466, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 100, "last_played": 1503391642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071434537"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497594558, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I have played this game since it released.\nBy far, I think this is best graphics archery VR game as shown in the trailer.\nDevs are active, shooting feels nice and realistic.\nLooking forward upcoming updates.", "recommendationid": "32465344", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1497594558, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 115, "last_played": 1498707745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991061185"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1495346795, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's wellmade archery VR.\nI hope to fix arm motion IK I think it's very odd.\nalso I think It's better use active skill than passive skill.", "recommendationid": "31876085", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1495346795, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_forever": 66, "last_played": 1503821558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975180533"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
