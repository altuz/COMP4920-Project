The combat feels great and realistic (although it still needs some tweaking) \n2.) The AI is great, it feels like the NPCs know what their doing\n3.) The maps look great, and they feel real\n4.) Lots of different maps\n5.) You can defend your castle, or you can attack one to try to take it\n6.) The developer is very active, and i'm pretty sure he has no life except for this game\n7.) The Developer takes every suggestion under consideration, and most end up in the game\n8.) You can command you troops with your voice, you set it up in the settings\n9.) Can customize how much of each troop is in each army, how many units on the field at a time, and how many each army has\n\n Negatives\n\n1.) Lag, lots of lag with bigger battle\n2.) Unit control feels weird at first\n3.) Throwing things like axes, and spears, is very hard to get used to, i still haven't gotten the hang of it\n4.) The throwing spear people are a pain, i just turn them off\n5.) Still has lots of bugs (but these are getting fixed very fast)\n\nOverall, this game is worth the money, but if you don't trust it enough to spend $30, there is a great demo that shows off the game, and you can see if your PC can handle it.", "recommendationid": "33910937", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "timestamp_created": 1501439040, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_forever": 2350, "last_played": 1505677188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067630900"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503634806, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "TLDR- If VR large scale medieval combat with 100\u2019s of troops across large maps and a huge variety of weapons sounds fun, buy this game.\n\nIt is one of my absolute favorite games and one of the best VR experiences, imo, so far. It\u2019s early-access, but getting better every day, with an active dev, an experience offering tons of gameplay already and a full campaign plus multiplayer on the horizon.\n\nAt some point quickly, after playing for a bit, you will find yourself sweating, weapon in hand, standing over the bodies of your enemies and realize how awesome this game is.

There are sliders so you can adjust for optimal gameplay until optimization is finished. \n-Single player campaign is beta atm.\n-Multiplayer is planned, but not ready yet. \n\nAll that being said, this is one of the most fun and immersive VR battle experiences, if you are cool with early access and your PC can handle the NPC load.

Seeing that the developer is actively updating the title is what swayed my decision to purchase.  For me I think the thrill this game brings to the table was worth the price of admission.  However, it is that steep price of admission that prevents me from giving this a complete thumbs-up at this point.  It's buggy, and that's expected with an early access title. However, I'm finding that there are areas that are currently completely unplayable, and maybe I don't understand the underlying problems, but the frustration it brings to the game should not be present at this price point.  So I do not recommend it for the average frugal gamer, but not for the reasons others have stated.  I am not affected by motion sickness, so I could ride that horse all day.  I'm not seeing much in the way of framerate loss, except in really big close-quarters battles, but if it were an issue, the game allows you to decrease the activity level and graphics quality to compensate.  I do not recommend it for the current price, and for the reasons below.  Lower the price, or fix the following issues, and I will happily change my stance.\n\nFirst and foremost, the in-map menu (which I stumbled upon) only allows you to exit to the main screen.  It should also allow for an options change.   I loaded three custom maps today and was stuck on the opening screen in each case.  Castle Siege - Stuck in Tent, Docks - Stuck on boat, Forest - Stuck in Tent.  So, in all three cases, I could not progess, and I could not escape.  So I had to force close the game and start over.  At the time I didn't know about the popup exit menu (not in the tutorial).  Maybe changing to another form of locomotion would have allowed me to escape the tent prisons, but didn't have access to the options.  An in-map menu with some options would help if the underlying bugs can not be corrected easily.  For instance, give is a clipping option, so we can get unstuck if a respawn point puts you in a bad place.  Currently, there are at least three maps that are unusable, that a switch like that would allow us to use.  I doubt I'm the only one experiencing that.\n\nController issues.  I sometimes find that the controllers temporarily switch roles.  Where the right controller will start affecting movement, but only partially.  It's weird.  I have also had problems inadvertantly summoning the horse by accidentally hitting the left menu button.  The horse was \"parked\" outsidet he castle, and suddenly I was riding him inside a tower.  You should only be able to mount the horse when you are near it.   Just a frustration, but character control in general needs some work.  Another annoyance is if you hit the System button while in-game and then return, the orientation is messed up and you need to restart.  That may only be a Vive thing.\n\nGiving orders is a pain, there has to be an easier way.  Since I'm using a Vive, the touch sensor and trigger combo is difficult in the heat of battle.  I do like being able to single out your men and give them individual orders, but when trying to coordinate the group it gets crazy.  \n\nGameplay itself is fun, and after completing a map I feel like a badass.  The AI and animations are done very well.  The feeling of being in the chaos of battle is conveyed nicely.  For me that was worth the price.  I would however suggest adding either an equipment area where the character can equip their weapons before going into a battle map, or allowing the player to select a start timer for the battle, so that you could equip the character and set up your troops before the enemy attacks.  It's too rushed right now.  It would also be nice to see statistics after a battle. Number of kills, men lost, etc.  It just ends and nothing that was accomplished is recorded anywhere.  Each battle is a new battle.\n\nThe custom battle option is great, and if the \"battle bugs\" are cleared up it can help to keep the game feel fresh.  I see there is work being done on a campaign mode, but it doesn't appear to be anything more than a world map at this point.  That would be nice if the devs could get a story behind it.  I would then change my recommendation.  I would also like to see a battle map editor where we could design our own battlefield in sandbox fashion.  Either a campaign or a sandbox would keep me coming back, the custom battle as it stands only has limited replayabliity and is not worth the price.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is a great VR experience, but for the price it needs to be more than just an experience.  For any interested buyers, I would suggest bookmarking this title and returning to it when it is slightly more polished.... or cheaper.  That being said, if you want the thrill of being in a battle with 200 other NPCs shouting battle cries, then you should buy this.  That makes it worth it for me.", "recommendationid": "34217761", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511742", "timestamp_created": 1502642586, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 347, "last_played": 1503249222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007964795"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503329409, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very immersive, my favorite VR game at the moment (I only have 6).
