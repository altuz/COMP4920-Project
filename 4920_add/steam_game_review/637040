Ever played Carmageddon or Destruction Derby? Well, this is it - a perfect mix of these two games in Virtual Reality, with great graphics, nice control system, crazy immersion in VR and amazingly funny gameplay. \n\nI have made a Mixed Reality VR gameplay video of RoadkillerZ, you have probably never seen anything like it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0F1Y-F5wsU\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphical environment is truly great looking and shiny. There are several quality settings in main menu, and I could play this without issues on Hight and Ultra (I kept it on High for recordings). The cars are very detailed and realistic, and the maps has nice atmospheres. The walking zombies also looks polished, and if you run into them they go into pieces of flesh, just lovely!\nSounds:\nThe sound effects and car engines sounds are spot on, you really hear the surround sound from every direction precisely and it adds a lot to the game immersion. The music seems nice, but I prefer to play it without music.\n\nPhysics:\nLovely physics of the cars, with realistic suspension, challenging but still not frustrating steering system of the cars and the cars are responding as expected in turns, 180s and when jumping/flying. Physics is one of this games best things! The only thing I miss is the ability to destroy the cars (parts flying off etc), but that will hopefully get added later on, I assume. The control system with Vive controllers is working good even if it could get polished with updates. \n\nGameplay:\nYou can compete against 1,2 or 3 opponents on both maps. I would recommend to start off with 1 to learn the steering and the shooting. The shooting part is a pit tricky, especially with the \"bigger\" truck as its aiming a bit too high, and I miss a lot of shots while playing agains the \"smaller\" cars and I can hardly hit any zombies with the machine gun. There are bonuses/powerups you can collect on both maps such as \"repair\", \"nitro\" and probably more later on. \n\nPerformance:\nI run a GTX 1080 Ti so of course it works great. But I think a GTX 970 should handle Medium or High settings without problems. The difference between High and Ultra is not big.\n\nThe maps & cars:\nIn the first version of RoadkillerZ we have 2 maps/arenas  and 2 cars to choose from. Both are different, and I personally prefer the bigger car (for better visibility) and the second map (Black Sky) which has more cool stuff like traps, jumping hills/ledges, power ups, places to hide etc.\n\nMotion Sickness?\nNope, none at all. \n\nValue:\nSeriously, this game costs nothing. Less than 4 euro for a game like this is a no-brainer. This is one of the best HTC Vive games under 10 euro, and probably the best for this price.", "recommendationid": "32071782", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510522", "timestamp_created": 1496178970, "author": {"num_reviews": 70, "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_forever": 107, "last_played": 1496182142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198164837178"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497746211, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It's way too early to tell if this game will turn out good. The motion controls are unreliable making the driving very difficult. The map is very simplistic and basic which doesn't really lead to any interesting gameplay. The driving mechanics are rather basic as well so there isn't very rewarding gameplay. That said, a VR Carmageddon-type game where you have guns on cars is a surefire idea if it can be executed well. Also, it remains to be seen if this genre of game benefits much from VR. I'm all for cockpit VR games but the genre is niche as it is and Carmageddon (not VR) already exists.", "recommendationid": "32522368", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1497746211, "author": {"num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 313, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1499878844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961914427"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496976324, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "New Review:\nSo I tried again as the dev said most problems were already solved!\n-If you chose \"VIVE\" in the controls as your gamepad, it won't work. You have to use \"controller right hand\" or it doesn't work on vive?\n-The level chosing menu/ennemy/car garage is utterly confusing. Trigger doesn't work to select 80% of the time\n-Once I was inside of the game, it was functionnal for a good 30 seconds then the wheel started turning to the left and I couldn't do anything else\n-I think I saw one zombie somewhere.\n\nThe dash boards and my game detects my VIVE properly so it's NOT an user-side problem afaik.\nMaybe those problems won't happen for a lot of people but as far as I'm concerned it's offputing.\n\nOld Review:\n\nWhaaat?\n\n-On VIVE, the trigger is used to fire and to accelerate. \n-The game crashed 3 times before I was able to go past the menu\n-Talking about the menus, you can barely navigate them. \n-Why do I have to be floating over the ground in the garage? OVR outputs the floor position and my HMD height. Is it too hard to just put it at the right height?\n-For what little I played the game, the car feels huge and there wasn't that many zombies around\n\nOverall, the idea is cool, the realisation not so much.

Stuff works but it does feel quite incomplete.\n\nThe graphics are average, good enough for this type of game if it's fun. Level design isn't anything spectacular. Performance-wise, some dropped frames on my 1080, but nothing serious but could induce motion sickness over a long session.\n\nThe controls are fine considering you're trying to use a steering wheel in mid air, but can't get the car to reverse so can get stuck against walls and pillars. The car motion is somewhat lifeless and could do with more dymanic physics to allow skids. Smashing into barrels and zombies, doesn't relay any feedback to give you the illusion you've really hit anything with mass. Same for the guns too.\n\nBased on the content, is it worth it? I'd say no. Sure the price is low. I've got a stack of early access VR games that promise to deliver great things. One thing I've learned is that if a VR ea title is poor to start with, things don't get a whole lot better on the full release either as they've already shown the limit of their ability from the outset. Double this up with a developer having one game to their name the chances are slim that the potenial is actually realised. I'm not trying to be negative to this individual developer, this has become far too common in VR ea games.\n\nI do like the idea of the game but this isn't fun or shows much game development ability that things will get a lot better. I stopped adding bad ea games to my library thinking they're going to improve with updates, they never do. It's cheap but I'm getting a refund, otherwise I'll be throwing away money on something I'll never play again.", "recommendationid": "32206070", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1496689092, "author": {"num_reviews": 111, "num_games_owned": 779, "playtime_forever": 8, "last_played": 1496685263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198020445786"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496630815, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I don't know what is going on but it keeps crashing my display on my cv1.
