Thanks to the soothing colour scheme, adorable graphics, and the simple nature of the story, this hidden object game sets a wonderful mood and manages to keep it to the end.\n\nSimplicity is also a keyword in gameplay: the puzzles are straightforward, the various kinds of hidden object scenes often rely on large and recognisable items, and even the bonus collectibles are easy to spot.\nEverything is set to have some laid-back fun, except for one thing. A thing that may be a deal-breaker for many: the animations are discomfortably cheap-looking and hideous, so be ready for a shock right from the opening cinematic.", "recommendationid": "34914184", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525228", "timestamp_created": 1505283615, "author": {"num_reviews": 443, "num_games_owned": 443, "playtime_forever": 184, "last_played": 1505032066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042831386"}, "votes_up": 11}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
