Some of the levels are extremely long and if you make one mistake you have to start over from the beginning.  There's an \"easy\" mode but it doesn't make it any easier.  If you're a master at platformers, or OK with ragequitting half way through the game, then you should play this, otherwise it might frustrate you.\n\nThese problems were fixed by the excellent Bit.Trip Runner 2, which has mid-level checkpoints.  For most people, I recommend you play that game first.  If you want more of a challenge, come back and play Bit.Trip Runner.  Its not really a worse or more primitive game, so I don't think there'd be any problem with playing in reverse order.  The first game is just harder and more frustrating."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505608417, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502678", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35010506", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198420355485", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506291438, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_forever": 175}, "timestamp_updated": 1505608417, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have a love-hate relationship with this game. I purchased it on the wii shop 3-4 years ago. I remeber raging at it and I was able to get to world 3. I stopped playing one day and haven't really played it since. Fast-foward to about a week ago, I found this on Steam and decided to play it. I also bought with the soundtrack but I'll get to that in a bit. I got nostalgia and remebered everything. 2 hours of gameplay later and I've finally made my decision about this game.\n\nThings I love:\n-The best main menu music to any game ever\n-The rest of the music is great and very catchy\n-It's very short and can be completed in a few days if you spend enough time on it\n-The cutscenes are pretty cool\n-The boss battles are unique and creative\n\nThings I hate:\n-Difficulty spike on 1-11 (newcomers beware)\n-Only one character\n-Some levels drag on way too long\n-No checkpoints (not even on bosses)\n-The music can get annoying and repetitive\n-Some levels are way too short and can be completed in about 30 seconds\n-some levels make me want to throw up because of how ugly they are\n\n4/10\n\nThis game's soundtrack is phenominal but the music isn't everything. Gameplay wise, it's boring repetitive and way too hard."}]}
