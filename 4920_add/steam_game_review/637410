If you like this kind of game, with nothing but shooting stuff, then give it a go, but i just can't recommend it without more to do.

I am a big fan of large capital ship space battles, and I think if you can also admire the designs of those kinds of ships you will still get some enjoyment from what this game offers as of now. However, beyond the ship designs being cool and the combat being \"just okay\" it feels very Early Access still, with little to the levels beyond blasting away at the main enemy capital ships that appear and fending off smaller fighter planes. \n\nThis can still be enjoyable, but it could use more immersion. The sound effects while decent seem sparse. Some kind of speed or UI indicator beyond the very miniscule 'shake' your view does while using your speed boost would add to the effect of using that ability, maybe some vignetting or blurring around the edges of the player view? Or at the least a \"boost sound\" \n\nYour boost also seems to be a bit wonky in that it will work sometimes and then at others it seems like I have to click the stick in a few times to get it to register. Your ship feels quite slow overall when moving at its default speed.  The controls on Xbox One USB controller take a bit of getting used to, with LT mapped to moving your ship backward and RT mapped to moving your ship forward, with rotating your ship on the dpad. In the control options the creator(s) note that being able to remap the buttons will (??) be coming in a future update, so maybe this will alleviate some of the control issues and make the game feel more fluid than it does in its current state. That being said, you do get used to it after awhile.\n\nSomething that I enjoy in this genre of game and I think this game would benefit largely from are \"radio chatter\" style portraits popping up during the combat, from friendlies and enemies. I realize this may be out of range of the creator's budget, with voice acting etc.. but I think it would make the game more immersive and make the enemy capital ships seem more adversarial / boss-like than ... placeholder floating big enemy. \n\nThe enemy capital ships health is very ambiguous and you're just kind of plunking away at them until they explode. A portrait popping up of an enemy saying \"I'm in trouble now...\" or something along those lines would do well to further immerse the player and also make them aware of what's going on that the limited UI doesn't seem to portray. \n\nYour own ship's health seems a bit vague as well right now, whereas a computer AI voice for the ship (i.e. \"shields low\" \"damage critical\" etc..) would warn the player and also add some to the immersion.\n\nThe text used in the game (\"enemy ships detected in nearby area\" \"earth is under attack\" etc) looks very generic.  \n\nAlthough you have a variety of weapons to cycle through it's not very clear which do better to lower the enemy fighters' shields or actual health, and you're just left to kind of assume which may or may not be more effective. \n\nAll these criticisms aside, the game just recently released and it looks quite good, with the colorful flares of the firefights going off and the large capital ships floating by with planets in the distance. I just think the game could use more immersion via a variety of sound effects (more 'hit' noises, steam, rockets/turbos boosting -yours or others-, whatever..) and the aforementioned portraits or radio or AI chatter. As-is right now you're just kind of thrown into an area to float along and blast away at the enemy capital ship until it explodes and then you're warped to the next area to the do the same thing. I enjoy what's there, but I'm also a big fan of this kind of setting (large capital ship space battles) so I may be biased to forgive the game's shortcomings otherwise. I can't help but imagine that ripping by an enemy capital ship while your booster is roaring (or their engines are making some kind of sound beyond just floating along silently...) as their portrait pops up lamenting you would add to the overall fun/immersion rather than it just being a pretty straight-forward, quiet experience.\n\nI hope the creator continues to refine what is here! I enjoy the look of the game and think the overall premise is cool, I just think more effects to immerse the player would go a long way.", "recommendationid": "33889038", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502227", "timestamp_created": 1501358801, "author": {"num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "playtime_forever": 167, "last_played": 1504231354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500689706, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "not worth 5 bucks.
