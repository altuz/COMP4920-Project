This makes aiming very difficult.\n\nThe game doesn't appear to have any sort of save-point mechanism, you play until you die then start back from the very beginning.\n\nI saw the positive reviews and thought I would give it a shot, despite the video/screenshots (I care more about gameplay then graphics) but alas it doesn't have any meaningful gameplay elements that would keep me coming back more than the 9 minutes I spent figuring out how to play.", "recommendationid": "32332254", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510759", "timestamp_created": 1497147576, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 268, "playtime_forever": 9, "last_played": 1497146734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989776530"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1496339683, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is actually a really fun VR game for the price. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but it was a lot more addictive than I thought!
