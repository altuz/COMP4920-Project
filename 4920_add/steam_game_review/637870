VR does not make this game more immersive or fun.  I could have played this game on a mobile phone and it wouldn't have taken away from the experience all that much.\n\nThe puzzles are nice, especially if you like this type of game.  However, if you don't like Angry Birds or Cut the Rope or you're just tired of those types of games, then you won't like this either.  \n\nVery tough call, because this is not a bad game.  It works fine and the puzzles are nicely done.  I got this game on sale and even then I can't recommend it.  The most this game is worth is $2.99.  I would change this to recommend for .99 cents.\n\nRate 4/10, hate to downvote, but just not enough gaming fun for $9.99 in my opinion, would recommend only at lower price or if you love these type of puzzle games", "recommendationid": "34367604", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1503214773, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 845, "playtime_forever": 19, "last_played": 1503211810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
