This mixes as well as milk and vinegar\nPlay a better suited real time clicker/cooldown version of this concept for single player here\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/496300/Kingdom_New_Lands/\n\nSidescroll base management. Made into a turn based PVP game. Everything seems to be centered around hotspot manipulation and the user interface feels very unintuitive and clunky. As if it had been designed for swype interface. Zooming in and out was sluggish and slow. Sprites were altogether too tiny and lacked detail. Too many of the same assets everywhere. Recycles a lot of concepts from Dwarf Fortress but only implements them as superficially as possible (e.g. soil layers)"}]}
