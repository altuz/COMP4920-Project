The objective is to push the opposing side into their base by choosing units that counter their selection of units.  The unit strengths/weaknesses are not distinct enough, and the whole campaign can be beaten by mindlessly spamming units.  The game has nice graphics, but I would only recommend this game for a younger audience not seeking too much of a challenge.", "recommendationid": "32095942", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517674", "timestamp_created": 1496271273, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 204, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1496270243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982379691"}, "votes_up": 11}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
