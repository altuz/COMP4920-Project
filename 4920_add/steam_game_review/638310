So ask relatives about what they know. If you have any documents like (birth/death/marriage certificates, military papers, SSN, ANYTHING, that wil help tramedesly. The software is very easy and basic to use, doesn't need a scientist to figure it out. I've used the software for about 23 hours, and I'm satisfied with it. And once you have many generations on your tree you can then print it out, or publish to show the world or your family. Everyone should know atleast somewhat of where they came from. Wouldn't you want to know?", "recommendationid": "33657460", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507202", "timestamp_created": 1500491150, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 334, "playtime_forever": 1518, "last_played": 1500945936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198117418599"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
