The menu interaction being the most egregious issue. Edit: Dev pushed an update within hours.\nBut once I got past that and lowered the in game graphics, I was quickly doing a few quests and fighting skeletons trying to lvl up. \nAs with a game of this ambition it's obviously going to have some hiccups. From wonky items fighting to get into your inventory to a giant 2d moon rising in the middle of the quarry. But I certainly didn't find anything game breaking. \nMy biggest gripe is that it could use some optimization. I had to set the in game settings at the second lowest setting to get it to run smooth. (i7 1080ti) Adjusting SS didn't help.\nCombat isn't Vanishing Realms caliber (shocking) but that's not it's selling point. I felt it was fine. Weapons have a short cooldown to prevent waggling. Two handed weapons have a longer cooldown than daggers ect...\n\nEdit: I blew through almost all the quests and content in close to 17hrs. \nIf you're looking for an EA Elder Scrolls lite with loot, quests, and xp, then look no further.", "recommendationid": "32005076", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500674", "timestamp_created": 1495917149, "author": {"num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 150, "playtime_forever": 1015, "last_played": 1498937346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198301417309"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497483593, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I think this games idea is amazing! there is a few glitches i would like to adress though. One was when i dropped a pickaxe, it floated above my reach, Another being unable to unequip other items when I go to unequip it and it say \"unable to equip item\" when I'm trying to equip it. Otherwise it is great to buy it now for when it gets more expensive later. if any of you know if i'm doing something wrong when trying to unequip items please tell me as it makes the game tougher. One more thing is that the bow is very wonky and changes directions when trying to aim. Thanks.

To address this issue, I made an update today greatly simplifying the controls.
