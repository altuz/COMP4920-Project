It is a SINGLE-PLAYER (co-op is a future possibility, according to developers multiplayer IS NOT, please stop clogging discussion page with the same repetitive question, \"Is this game multiplayer?\").  It is an open world, animal-themed crafting game.  The developers created the Animallica mod for Skyrim previously.  As it is a post-apocalyptic setting, animals are diseased and must be captured and cured. They can then be released or kept as companions or put in enclosures. Animal interaction is still somewhat limited, but breeding, and possibly genetics, are planned. Currently, there are around 15-20 different animals including many of the large African mammals.  Additionally, there are enemies which consist of mutant animals and bandit humans. These are found randomly and around spawning nests.\n\nCrafting is accomplished through building increasingly complex stations including a science lab to cure and heal animals. The variety of craftable items is currently somewhat limited particularly in relation to unnecessary to game items like furniture and decorations. Resources are the typical wood, stone and various ores. Additionally, rare multicolored shards allow upgrades and other perks.\n\nExploration, discovery and resource collection are primary at present. While some people call it a survival/crafting game with an animal theme that is a little misleading. After initial gameplay, survival is rather easy particularly after acquiring armor. Food, water and stamina come into play but do not hinder the experience, all readily available or craftable.\n\nWithout doubt, this is one of my favorite current games and one of my all time favorites. Remember, it is early release and content is continually added (15 updates in first two months of availability). Updates always address bugs but content is also regularly added. The visuals on this game are stunning and on my newer system I notice very little lag. Have not done a fps analysis, sorry.  There are numerous biomes to explore each having a different theme and availble loot and animals. The developers are readily available and regularly respond to questions related to bugs and gameplay as well as reasonable suggestions.  For an early release game it is one of the best looking, well developed ones I have seen in a long time. If you like an animal theme, great graphics and a responsive development team, give this one a chance.\n", "recommendationid": "34785167", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536343", "timestamp_created": 1504741610, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 88, "playtime_forever": 14308, "last_played": 1504362733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198241936530"}, "votes_up": 22}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506807939, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very playable in it's current state. The crafting is deep and pretty much complete IMO. Graphics leave a little to be desired, but they plan on overhauling them soon. Early Access done right, well worth the normal price of $20. The only issues I have is that the game tends to be a resource hog, I can run it at 60fps on ultra with my 970, but it pushes it to near 100% usage, so I play on high for heats sake, lol.
