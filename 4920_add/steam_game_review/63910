Crossworlds is like a improved and touched up Armored Princess. It's great, although I do like Dark Side more, it ended up feeling a little hallow/empty at the end, especially after struggling up the enormous timesink and hill that was Hard mode. But still, it's a improvement on the legend, and it's loads of fun. I like it more then Warriors of the North.\n\nThe Legend has a special place in my heart, still, but it's really primitive on some parts as much as its simplicity can be awesome and purer. If you're only buying one though, buy Dark Side all the flipping way."}]}
