As others have said it's Pilot Wings VR basically, and I loved that game so this is right up my alley.  \n\nI feel the need to address some of the negative reviews.  One person complained about wanting to be able to use a HOTAS.  For those that have them I agree that would be a good feature to add.  But I don't feel limited by using the Vive controllers - it's actually pretty accurate and I feel it adds to the immersion.  Sometimes I have to recenter my location so the stick is not too far ahead, but once you do that you can rest your arm on your leg and it is comfortable.\n\nAnother said it doesn't have enough content.  Keep in mind at time of writing that person has ~0.4 hours of playtime.  I'm at 3 hours and it says I have beat ~17%.  Trying to get gold on each challenge could take a while.  Plenty of content.\n\nFinally the last complaint I read was that the difficulty curve was too high.  I didn't seem to have a problem - the first Ultralight plane is pretty forgiving to fly and the tutorial levels step you through the flight characteristics pretty well.  My 8 year old was able to figure it out.\n\nOverall this game is definitely a buy.", "recommendationid": "34925906", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500278", "timestamp_created": 1505331268, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 84, "playtime_forever": 336, "last_played": 1507172087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "steamid": "76561197993904628"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505536803, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "I think VR in general is a quicky expiring fad, but that said, ultrawings is a delight to play.
