Don't let that put you off though ;)\n\nThis game is by far the best VR experience I've had to date.  I'm old enough to remember the original Operation Wolf in the arcades. That machine got a lot of my 50p's I tell you.\nSo what can I say about this game? \n\n1. Whether you have VR or not, buy it. It plays in 2D/3D on a regular screen as well.\n2. I got it in the steam sale for \u00a38.99 but it's easily worth the full asking price.\n3. You build up a posse of NPC fans behind you. Virtual pals are better than none I guess.\n4. If you feel the rage after losing go for a walkabout and punch/push some of them over.  It's very theraputic.\n5. In VR mode you can almost stick your head in the screen to look around.  \n6. Immersion within immersion.  There are various immersion points in all the levels that give you a different POV in the game.  This is amazingly executed in VR. I luvs the explosive <3 bow & arrows <3\n7. It surpasses the original arcade game in many many ways, suffice to say, the game is awesome.\n\nOne niggling issue is the game crashes out on rare occasions. \nAnother bug is the game glitches sometimes in VR, making the view jumpy/shaky, which is a little off-putting to say the least. Thankfully it doesn't happen very often and when it does just restart the game. Not a huge problem as I said but will keep submitting bug reports.\n\nWhether you're into playing classic arcade or want fresh, fun challenges, then this game deserves a bit your time. \n\nQuite simply, this is an excellent remake of an 80s all time classic. It comes with my \"RaNDoM(PReCiSioN) Highly Recommended\" badge.", "recommendationid": "34203280", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1502585588, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 261, "playtime_forever": 376, "last_played": 1505769001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197985660408"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502509303, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Lettin ya know from the start, played this on an Oculus Rift. It is what it looks like: you go into VR and then into an arcade. If you were a teen in the 90s, you probably sunk some quarters into this baby. Nostalgia aside, this was a lot of fun. There are two modes (2 stand up arcade machines in fact), one for a regular version of the game with optional 3d mode (just shoot at the toggle) and the fully VR immersive. The 3d was a strain on my eyes (felt like I was going cross eyed) so I stuck with the VR. \n\nYou can play like normal except you can defy some laws of somethin' and stick your head in the game to scan (and shoot) the areas. It was more fun that it sounds. At regular intervals, an \"immersive\" mode pops up - you shoot it - and bam! You are inside the game and in some kind of fight for your life. These immersive experiences vary from throwing knives, double uzi's, to (poorly) flying a jet fighter. And that's all I got to before logging out and writing this. This game is a keeper for me.
