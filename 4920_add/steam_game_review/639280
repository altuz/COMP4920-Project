And you can't ever fill 'er up. You have just enough energy to get you to the next spot. That's if you planned and executed your path there correctly, otherwise you'll fall to your death or run into a trap where you'll die and also fall to your death. There's a lot of dying involved. \n\nAnd you have these robots making fun of you along the way. I found the robot characters to be hysterical. Definitely, took some material from Portal, but hey, nothing new under the sun, right? \n\nWell, except for this game. Because it is amazingly fun. I love it. VR platformer done right. So much polish and it's only in EA. I look forward to seeing where this game will end up when it's a totally finished product.  This is as a must buy if you like puzzle platformers or VR. Even if you don't, you may after trying this game.\n\nRate 9/10 ... would put thruster implants in my hands and boost around dangerous trap areas again for science!", "recommendationid": "35039614", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1505713606, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1505709316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
