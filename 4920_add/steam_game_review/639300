(Though the Rome setting is coming soon per the Devs)\n\nIf you like a detailed opinion of the game, read on! :)\n\nWell, \n\nI'm not much for writing reviews on the steam website, but felt perhaps this one was a good time for that cause I've been enjoying the dedication the Devs have given to this game post release so far. Overall if you played the first game, called Age of Gladiators, then you will encounter features very similar to that with this one. \n\nHowever, this sequel expands upon the first game pretty much ten fold by adding a lot new interesting things to do, but in fairness perhaps still needs fine tuning like the way you invest in properties and such for this one. \n\nThe big change from the first one to the 2nd, is naturally the setting is totally different now, we're in the future now (however, the Devs have promised a Age of Gladiators 2: Rome version a few months from now..) and the set-up of the gladiators is more league/season based akin to the usual sports management games out there or unlike the first one which is more ladder based on the 3 owners you were competing with in a particular region before moving on. \n\nOverall, this change is a good change since I've always been a fan of the sports theme of these kind of games, so to include league standings, and than a playoff each and every season, makes the replay-ability pretty great since there is also record keeping like the first game which is probably my biggest complaint on the first game, since once you got the Rome, and beat the first 3 owners, well what now?, this way the League/Playoff structure keeps things a bit more fresh as time goes on.  Speaking of Balance, if you do pick it up you may find yourself struggling for the first few games, than all of sudden get yourself on a great wining streak in which you feel unstoppable and there's a good chance you could even win the championship during your very first season as some other plays have done. (currently 24-6 myself in my first season)\n\nSome may enjoy this, but some may not, however, it should be noted that the balance of this is constantly be tuned by the devs, and the game certainly seems much harder now from the first season onward that it was when initially released. (perhaps some may thing it's too hard now, but it's going to be a process that will be continued to be refined as time goes on by them..) \n\nWhich brings me the next good point, the Devs seem to really care about this game as new updates are constantly being put out there based on all the bugs that the player base has reported. Hell, even minor suggestions are being implemented now if it's easy to do for them... For example, I suggested that when you upgrade the buildings you buy, you should see the cost of it (initially it was just the upgrade button, but you didn't know how much it cost to upgrade, and certain building prices vary by a lot..).. 3 hours later, that suggested feature was in the game with a new update. \n\nYea, I know, it feels like it's a common sense kind of thing to do, and why shouldn't it have been included in the first place? But the fact their taking suggestions and try to implement them into the game if it's feasible and within the Dev's vision is a nice treat to see.  \n\nAs for the combat itself, instead of just the one simulate mode that the first game had, we now get to choose from 3 modes instead. Simulate, Spectate, or actually take part in the battle. In my personal experience I've only taken part in the battles, I haven't simulated or spectated any of the games. The battles themselves are as the screenshots and video trailers shown above, tactical based, top down... \n\nIs it as good as X-Com 2? of course not, but in general it serves the purpose of what it needs to do. Naturally the downside to this, is unlike the first game, when you start going to stuff that's tactic base, the player base can easily find ways to beat the AI, no matter how buffed the AI can be. So that is something to keep in mind, and perhaps why the victories in the early seasons are so common for most players, especially if you are a veteran of these tactic types games, and learn what key stats are good for those types of battles you participate in. (Some say it's all about Action Points)\n\nHowever, that's why the other 2 modes are there if you feel you wish to handicap yourself somewhat and just focus more on the managing aspect of your gladiators like the way it was in the first game. \n\nAnd I think that all I gotta say about the game for now, so yea, long winded I know, but as long you're a fan of the first game, you can't go wrong with this sequel. However, if the sci-fi theme is not your thing, than just wait for Age of Gladiators 2: Rome which should be released in a few months by these devs as well.", "recommendationid": "35225438", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505017", "timestamp_created": 1506444058, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 213, "playtime_forever": 937, "last_played": 1506548710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 937, "steamid": "76561198005194478"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506247244, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Very enjoyable game with some cool mechanics.

Great racial abilities too!\n-Unique races, a nice variety of arena types and lovely backgrounds create an immersive environment.\n-Expand your facilities within a massive asteroid (meteor? not sure). Basically lots of unique upgrade buildings. Crucial.\n-Compete in an american-football-style gladiator tournament to push for the playoffs!\n-Hire a variety of staff members to train gladiators, heal/clone/surgery-(cyborg) gladiators, recruit, maintain gear...\n-Become attached to beloved gladiators, and either cry when they die or save-scum like me. Or clone their corpse.\n-I actually like that I can make as many save files as I wish, so I can be the ultimate save-scumming loser...\n-Purchase properties like hotels, businesses, etc. Grow your fame to reap the rewards.\n-Bet millions for or against your own fighters.\n-Recruit fighters from all sorts of planets, or even right out of prison! Don't have money for salaries? Buy slaves!\n-Participate in a \"Draft\" where you select from the best young academy recruits, as young as 16!\n-Blood gladiators fight to the death, but there is a pee-wee league of sorts for your young academy drafts to learn.\n\nThings I'd like to see added in the future:\n-A greater variety of weapons, armors, special items, etc.\n-Large gladiator battles like 10v10, 20v20...\n-Creatures/animals, I know it would be hard to balance considering the bipedal requirements for gladiators n such.\n-Environmental hazards in the arenas\n-Space battles in space arenas! (Anti-gravity may be hard though)\n-Gladiator backstories, family ties, quests, unpaid debts, etc. Though, the bounties are a nice touch!\n\nThere is a lot more to this game than I am even mentioning! I would definitely recommend this to anybody that enjoys relaxing strategy-management games. The sci-fi setting is great, and I am so glad that AoG2 had the guts to revamp things in this great new setting! Overall I would give the game a rating of 9/10. I think that there are a few things that could be improved upon, but in general I really enjoy it! I will keep things updated as I go along, this is my new go to \"late night relaxer\" video game!

Essentially a spreadsheet keeping track of your players and their stats and the other teams and their stats, and number-crunching the results of games (or fights in this case) and plotting everyone's position in the league. \nIn this sequel you get actual graphical representation of the fights, and you can also take control of your gladiators (up to 3 vs 3 in any contest) with X-COM lite style turn-based combat.\nI expected to find myself watching the fights play out in spectator mode, but I'm having more fun taking control. If you are looking for tactical combat alone you might find other titles out there do it better (eg. X-COM, or warband style games like Mordheim).  The fun in this game is the way the fairly simple combat ties into the much deeper managerial aspects of the game - managing finances, training, healing injuries, improving your facilities, etc. Every fight has implications for your finances, your position in the league, your individual fighters development. It makes each fight importnt and really draws you in. And behind every fighter, there are tons of stats which all come into play in the arena and which you can influence through your choices as manager. \nIn the same way plenty of people can play through season after season of football manager matches, so too could you play through multiple seasons here. It's addictive. Some concerns have been raised about long term playability once you have a set of maxed-out fighters, but I am sure the dev is looking into this - dev support appears to be excellent so far in terms of fixing bugs and addessing issues.\nIt won't be everyone's cup of tea. If you like management sims, and have an eye for RPG style stats and figures, and you like to see the combat actually play out, you should love this. If you enjoyed the original AoG you should also love this, because everything is bigger and better. \nI was initially sceptical about the change to sci-fi setting, but it's fine.

They usually use pretty suspect tactics, never seem to employ the AP boosting adrenal stims or shields and, on a worryingly regular basis, waste 3AP of their turn using a completely irrelevant stim (ie. a melee character using a stim to buff their ranged aim) instead of attacking you.\n\nTheres a few other minor details, but I feel bad enough with what I've said already, given that i do actually really really *really* want to like this game... if some of the above points are rectified in later patches, I'll happily change my review, but at the minute I can't really recommend the game beyond a couple of hours worth of fun whilst the novelty is still there.", "recommendationid": "35277484", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504726", "timestamp_created": 1506644878, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 91, "playtime_forever": 990, "last_played": 1506646505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 990, "steamid": "76561198035846391"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506354668, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Still needs polishing, but so far it is constantly improving.\nAs far as I am concerned definitly some nice management game where I will pass a couple of hours.", "recommendationid": "35205420", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504359", "timestamp_created": 1506354668, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 180, "playtime_forever": 822, "last_played": 1506882893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 822, "steamid": "76561198024814518"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506218427, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Love the game, it's a great improvement over the original.\n\nAge of Gladiators II has far more depth and complexity, allowing for longer term saves without it feeling like a grind.\n\nAlso, the dev has released 5+ patches in the 3 days since launch.

I big change, definitely, but one that grew on me. The first one was unique for applying a management sim format to the Roman gladiator concept, and this one adds to the unexpected by blasting that combination into a sci-fi space setting. Definitely not a retread.\n\nOne of the major benefits of this is the variety of species that you can use as fighters, who have different skill sets related to their biology. I think these differences could maybe be expanded (gladiator officials make it clear that only creatures with a basically human shape can participate in league fights), but there's enough there to keep it interesting. Using cybernetics to repair injured fighters, long range weapons like laser rifles, and cloning dead fighters whose genetics had them winning straight through until they got unexpectedly killed are all components of the gameplay that I certainly haven't seen in a game of this kind.\n\nBottom line: it's an original take, like the first game in the series, but more so. It's fun to play, not too difficult and not too easy. While some of the sci-fi possibilities could be more fully explored, it's a really strong game and a welcome new spin on the gladiator management sim established by its predecessor.", "recommendationid": "35278791", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502142", "timestamp_created": 1506648808, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_forever": 302, "last_played": 1506647414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 302, "steamid": "76561198281370060"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506128606, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very good game, it's still early on but so far it looks really good and has been very fun to play.

AOG allowed you to pace yourself with money being the driving force of how often and how hard you would push your fighters into battle, in AOG2, now the league dictates, sometimes forcing you to put tired and wounded fighters into battle before they are ready.  AOG was melee only, AOG2 has melee and ranged. \n\nAOG2 introduces different species and leagues, and just has a lot more depth than AOG.\n\nIn all, I recommend it.
