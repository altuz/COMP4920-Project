But as with all those games (canabalt etc) there is very little actual gameplay content. It feels like you have seen everything after a few minutes.

If you are a machocistic enough to hunt the \"late-game\" achievements you will either get them in a few hours of souldraining grind or if you don't have the skillz or luck you'll likely go mad because you'll never ever ever get them in a million years!\n\nMaybe if you (as a player) invent some own rules to add to this (drinking game perhaps?) more fun can be had.
