Within the first ten minutes, I could already tell this game is really something special. Your first moments in game have you waking up late as an alien colonist on a violent planet, to be barked at by your superior officer, who singles you out for getting up late. After a brief (but welcomed) tutorial, you quickly see the beautiful chaos that this game offers. On a sidenote, the soundtrack is masterfully crafted and fits PERFECTLY with the aesthetic of the game. I am so happy I stumbled upon this gem and I cannot wait to get farther.", "recommendationid": "34277497", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520781", "timestamp_created": 1502894633, "author": {"num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 325, "playtime_forever": 66, "last_played": 1503190908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995377749"}, "votes_up": 15}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503308143, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I bought this for the neat looking graphics, and because it was on sale.. Wasn't worth it. You're placed into a random level each time, and each level takes 15-30 seconds to complete.Once you complete it, you're sent to a \"continue or return to base\" screen. If you hit continue, you're in for another 15-30 second level, and there's no real reason to go back to base, unless you're low on health or out of ammo (or if you've been instructed to go back). I heard this game wsa a fun challenge, but, and I know I'm only 2 hours in, it's not challenging at all. 10 seconds of stupid-easy gameplay, load next, repeat. And the graphics really aren't that good. They're unique, but nothing special. Don't buy this game.", "recommendationid": "34391426", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522457", "timestamp_created": 1503308143, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 137, "playtime_forever": 254, "last_played": 1503570153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197982965197"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503114404, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Original Journey is Shoot-em-Up, Adventure game game that features light RPG and Roguelite elements.\n\nYou can find a bit over 30 minutes of gameplay with commentary here:\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxGMYqW2NhM] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxGMYqW2NhM [/url] \n\nYou play as a Rookie Ato, a small plant clone that uses armor to move around. Your homeworlds core is failing and you have come as a grunt to the planet Shadow, to retrieve the Origin Stone that has the ability to save your homeworld. \n\nThe games RPG elements include a leveling system based on experience gained from killing monsters. Each time you kill a monster it will provide you with experience, drop a number of crystals (that are the games currency and also regenerate life when collected) and there is the chance that it will also drop an item. These items range from various materials needed to craft the games weapons and armor, ammo for your guns, to upgrade chips that provide your armor with a minor benefit. On leveling you will improve the games 3 stats - health, weapon damage and luck (to improve item drops).\n\nThe Roguelike part is the stages. Each stage is a self contained island, with obstacles that either are static and you take damage from touching them, ones that you can destroy, rocks and the like that block shots but are destructible, and floating clouds that are platforms. A range of enemies will spawn and the goal is to kill them, with each island getting progressively harder. The player needs to choose between increasingly better loot or returning to base and starting over. If you die on a run, all loot gained will be dropped at that level. You get one chance to fight your way back to the dropped loot - but if you die again or abandon your run, then those items are lost.\n\nWeapons are purchased via items collected in your runs. You can carry 2 at a time, but can only fire them separately. Each gun has their own ammo amount, which can be randomly replenished from enemy drops or by returning to base. The weapons are broken up into 3 tiers - with tier 1 consisting of a grenade launcher, mini gun, shotgun (your starting choices), sniper rifle and sword. Weapon damage is linked to your level, so weapons scale with the character.\n\nFinally there are the armor suits. The look of the armor is mostly cosmetic, but different armor types provide a bonus to the 3 player stats. Armor is also broken up into 3 tiers like weapons, and in a tier the only difference between armor (apart from cosmetic) is how it allocates its stats bonus. Tier 1 armor gives 4 bonus points which just vary their allocation based on the armor chosen. Armor also has a chip slot - these are collected from enemy drops. Chips provide small bonuses like extra health, extra ammo capacity for a certain weapon or a minor regen.\n\nThe art style is very nice, with hand drawn elements. The animations are smooth and the muted colour scheme suits the game well. The music and sound effects are also good - but the game does not seem to have an option to mute music or audio which I feel is lacking.\n\nThe game recommends playing with an Xbox controller, and other controller support will be coming apparently.\n\nI have found it to be an enjoyable game which can get very challenging. After 3 hours I am about 25% through (according to the game percentage). I am still in the first zone but believe I am close to getting to the next - so hopefully I will get 12 out of the game, which I feel is fair for the price. Your playtime may vary depending on skill.\n\nOverall I am happy to recommend this game.", "recommendationid": "34341892", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503784", "timestamp_created": 1503114404, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 655, "last_played": 1503817295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960286303"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
