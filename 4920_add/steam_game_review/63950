If you like Quake like mock battles in Spits and 109's I would check out ATAG (Air Tactical Assault Group) to test your skills against many excellent pilots.\n\nBut if you're like me and would like to get a close an experience to the actual Battle of Britain as possible you should check out ACG (Air Combat Group) for their marvelous historic multiplayer campaigns. They also don't care about your skill level so its an excellent place for flight sim noobs to get help.\n\nOther than that the servers are almost always active with most players flying in the evenings and on weekends.\n\n\nI give this game a 7/10 and highly reccomend that you buy it if you're interested in this conflict\n\n\nP.S They are working on a Desert Campaign DLC with new aircraft and locations but it is unknown when this will be released."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505003412, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477064", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34849904", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057118823", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1505780726, "num_games_owned": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 810}, "timestamp_updated": 1505003412, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Well...

I gotta say... if you are in Windows 10 you need to take a pass on this one.
