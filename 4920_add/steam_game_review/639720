You can exit the attack on the black soldier simply pressing the JUMP button in any moment. If you have 5 min take a look at the game manual, there are a lot of useful tips there: http://www.abloodynight.com/instruction-manual.html", "review": "An exceedingly repetitive game whose challenge can be described as cheap, Many deaths were beyond my control or ability, especially when it comes to black soldiers being paired up with other enemy soldiers. The moment you knock the black ones down, you lock into an attack animation that leaves you open to attack and you need to jump out of it to be able to do anything else. Archers and cannons can fire before you even get them on screen, hitting you before you can hit block. Archers can also run faster than you're capable of, so you need to stop and let them fire before you can attack them.\n\nA well constructed challenge is something that you, hypothetically, complete a stage on your first go based on skill and ability. This game is purely rote memorization of stages to a point where you can mechanically react to whatever is coming so that you can proceed.", "recommendationid": "34676689", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495192", "timestamp_created": 1504329975, "author": {"num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 738, "playtime_forever": 37, "last_played": 1504329239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034116281"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500945855, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "First of WOW this game is fun,funny,Challenging and CHEAP.
