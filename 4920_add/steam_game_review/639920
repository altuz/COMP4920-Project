Despite it's simplicity, it is challenging and some of the setups are pretty cool. I thought it was worth the $2. For that low of a price, I found it to be a pretty cool game. I haven't finished it all, but from what I have played, I'd say that it's worth getting, especially if you have a friend/family member that is try to help you.\n\nBasically, it's nothing extraordinary, but for only $2, it's worth giving it a try.", "recommendationid": "33635562", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1500402787, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 202, "playtime_forever": 31, "last_played": 1500172493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198119199131"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
