At first I couldn't get into the game. I had recently finished playing Blitzkrieg 2 and the scale of battle is really different.  Blitzkrieg 2 is a war; this game is just Special Forces carrying out assignments. Was also annoying that I had to install drivers and some other program to get this game to run as seen in the forum.  A tactical rts with no base building.  When you complete certain objectives, you get money to spend on reinforcements. Funds don't carry over, so might as well spend it all in the mission.\n\n20 missions lasted me 35 hours and that is with me making sure everyone survived and not really using all my funds in most missions. I think if I didn't care about that, an average mission would take around 30 to 45 minutes.\n\nI like how you can level up some of your soldier to be an officer, which can grant additional bonuses. The key is leveling up you vision of O\u2019Connell first. Then level up a sniper to an officer, so you can basically go around the whole map sniping the enemy. When shooting the enemy in building they don't react at all, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. Actually the AI barely reacts to your sniping. The guy next to them dies, they still stand there. Don't need to go prone or take cover. Just walk to an engagement and your good just make sure you have medics and marksmen. If I saw some vechiles coming, I would just run back to my tanks, stationed behind me. Since the AI can actually use rpgs well, I found most vehicles to be useless. I had to button up my guys in the tanks, so they wouldn't die. Path finding is mediocre, having your guys stuck trying to move is rather annoying, especially if there are enemies nearby.\n\nI would give this a neutral rating since it is not a horrible game, but since the AI is really lackluster I will give this a 4.5/10."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504376727, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503045", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34692055", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197971348059", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505654108, "num_games_owned": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2408}, "timestamp_updated": 1504376727, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I am carefully manoeuvering my squad through a bombed out town. My snipers take out a few enemies. Then all over sudden, a shell from a distant artillery unit hidden somewhere in the mountains lands right in the middle of my men, killing 5 out of 8. Frustrating moments like these are basically part of the gameplay. If your squad get attacked by a pickup truck mounted with a 50 cal machinegun, you basically have one option: take your AT soldier and tell him to blow it up! If he is still alive, that is, since the enemy gunner will usually take him out first. His chances to hit seem to be lower than 50%; more often than not, the rocket goes into the ground (you cannot really see every bump in the terrain from the players perspective, and therefore it's difficult to find the optimal position, but you won't have much time to do this anyway). If he misses, in most cases it will results in a squad wipe. You cannot charge with your light and heavy armor head first either, because of the enemy RPG. Kind of realistic, I suppose. But in the end, you will reload countless times (on heavy difficulty), trying to find out the one way that seems to work. I usually try to keep my troops alive to let them gain experience, which carries over from the missions, which is nice. Good graphics for a 2006 game, very nice sound effects and music, but a bit too much RNG for my liking."}]}
