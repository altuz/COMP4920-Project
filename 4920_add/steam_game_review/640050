First of all this is a decent looking cover based linear fps game. The graphics are acceptable but they definitely look dated. The synchronization is decent. The movement is fast and works good. The shooting works fine and is fun but you don't have any recoil so it's not very realistic at all. The enemy AI should be improved. They don't care about getting shot at at all. But they hit you pretty damn well even from very far away. If you get hit your character sways like crazy which makes the game even more cover based. I personally don't really like it that much because it kinda feels like an improved version of Crazy Chicken. You have to play careful and take your time. Enemys show up on linear levels and you have to kill them all one after another. You got some AI mates with you but they are not really useful. That's basically the game right now.\n\nWhy i still recommend it at this point? It seems like the devs really care. You can tell they put some work into it and i think they will keep doing it. This game looks better as the majority of EA games i saw on steam. I really hope they keep working on it because this could be the fps game i play over and over again when i get bored even tho i have to get used to the hardcore cover based gameplay but im willing to do that. I also think the price point is fair.\n\nSide note: The start of the first chapter was so freaking cheesy. Like every bad action movie plot that ever existed. Please don't do stuff like this. And if you get hit alot your character starts breathing like crazy and that sounds so weird it's really annoying.\n", "recommendationid": "34968717", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543613", "timestamp_created": 1505471927, "author": {"num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 477, "playtime_forever": 104, "last_played": 1505715638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198128436185"}, "votes_up": 28}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505856354, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "There is no decent FPS controller, which is vital for a FPS game.

What is a Universal Solider? I hear that term and immediately think Guardian of the Galaxy, aliens and space. This little gem is unfortunately totally grounded here on earth, in the browns, grays and greens of ever other wanna be Call of Duty out there. I just reviewed Full On Paintball last week and was sure that it was going to take my slot for worst game of 2017, and then this heavy weight got in the ring and beat FOP like Floyd beat McGregor.
