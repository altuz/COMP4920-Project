It's basically a \"choose your own adventure\" game in bite-sized chunks, in which you get quests from a quest board at the tavern, perform them through a series of text choices, succeed (or fail) and get rewarded, as well as unlock other races and classes. The production values are good, with a consistent art style. No crashes in 30 minutes of play.\n\n - The overall feel for the game and fact it can be played in short sessions makes me believe it would do well on mobile platforms. The engine could allow for other genres as well.\n\n - To the devs: you will need a native English speaker to write your text. It is never possible to do this well if English is not your first language. The current English is passable, but contains odd phrases and some incorrect words and grammar. For example, many quests refer to the \"Reign\", when the word you wanted was \"Realm\". But fixing small mistakes such as this won't get you AAA text -- that needs to be done by a good, native English speaker.\n\nThe game world feels fairly random, though I can tell some thought went into the lore. The problem here is that you're presented with everything at once -- all the races, factions, etc, and it's simply too much to consider at the start of the game. The game really needs a good, epic story mode that allow unlocking of new content (perhaps new quest hubs with new quests as factions slowly unlock?) as one progresses through the story; right now the quests feel fairly random and artificial. Allowing players to create DLC as mentioned in the description, could increase longevity / replayability by allowing for essentially endless content. I am not convinced the current design of leaderboards is the way to go, as they feel artificial and are not satisfying on an emotional / storytelling level.\n\nSome other thoughts:\n\n - It is not clear to how difficult a quest will be vs. my abilities before I take it. The same goes for engaging in combat. The \"3 skulls\" interface is a good start, but it's still fairly vague and doesn't give me a good idea of what my chances are. \n\n - In addition to a better ability to sense my chances of success (understanding that the way things are designed, this would probably have to be displayed on every choice), it would be nice to see the dice rolls. It would make things feel more like I was participating. Right now whether I succeed or fail feels like the game has made an arbitrary decision.\n\n - The once per fight special ability: right now I cannot think of a reason not to use thisat the start of every fight, which begs the question -- why have it at all?.I like the idea, but not the current implementation. Perhaps this should only be available at certain parts of the fight, and only if the choices match (for example,[spoiler]the fight with the drunk dwarf, in stage 3 when he stumbles toward you after you smash him with the beer mug...maybe only then does my special ability become usable).[/spoiler]\n\n - I would like more ways to obtain quests than the quest board in the inn. NPCs who sometimes appear in the tavern with random quests would be fun, as would quests that open up \"in the field\" while you're on another quest. A quest board is fairly sterile and lends to the artificial feeling of the lore.\n\nThe game engine is great.
