Just be aware that blades are still deadly when they don't move! I edited my review to reflect this point.\n\nTl;drThe game is pure fun, and at times very difficult and unforgiving\n\n\nRun of Mydan is best characterized as a \"weaponized endless runners with boss fights\" (At least on the first 3 levels. Apparently this changes later on and you can fly around freely!). you are shackled to a platform you can steer left and right, albeit slowly. The platform  moves relentlessly forward until it reaches one of the end-level bosses. As a player you have to avoid various obstacles set in your path and fight off various foes using an energy ball, a javelin or an energy shot (the last two are unlocked on later levels). There is no randomization in the level layouts but the movement of the various foes do varyi for each run, so muscle memory will help a lot to reach the end of the level, but the player still needs to be aware of his surroundings. \nVisually the game is actually stunning. Its consistent use of flat-shaded textured polygons works in its favour, both in depicting beautiful surreal landscapes and in keeping the framerate up. Soudwise you get a healthy share of (imo very good and fitting) electronic tunes, and sparse but well suited sound effects.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is a mix of fun, awe, and frustration. The difficulty variies a lot within single levels( ranging from super easy to eye-gouging difficult). So far I only have faced the first level boss, so I can only judge from him, but winning against him took some trivial guessing as to his weak point and some (in hindsight) easy jumping/moving.\n\nWhich brings us to the save points. Each level is split in segments and dying within one segment will warp you back to its beginning. Most of the time this works fine, but for some reason dying in a boss fight brings you back quite a bit, which means you have to repeat segments you already know by heart before you can fight the boss again. Not a game breaker but it can be frustrating, especially when winning against the boss seems to be based on pure luck. \n\nAll in all it is a very enjoyable game though, quite difficult at times and definitely a good workout (throwing the energy ball with enough force in the correct direction definitely takes its toll, and so does avoiding the foes and obstacles)\n\nOf course, being EA, the game might change a lot until full release, so some (most?) of the criticism might be irrelevant soon'ish, but even in its current state the game is well worth the money imo.", "recommendationid": "33988900", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515057", "timestamp_created": 1501753879, "author": {"num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 152, "last_played": 1504118663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197973389596"}, "votes_up": 11}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501497466, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "if you have an oculus or a vive this is a must have game !!\ngraphic is awesome and the gameplay smooth and fast\ni've tryed also the multiplayer and it's fantastic !!! 1v1 arena against your friends \ncan't wait to see the Capture the flag mode , maybe the best versus VR game experience i've treyed so far!\njust move like IRONMAN , switch to different weapons , shild yourself and destroy your opponent!!\ntotal immersion !", "recommendationid": "33924844", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498769", "timestamp_created": 1501497466, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 162, "playtime_forever": 269, "last_played": 1501515324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198005943663"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503572843, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The game is very promising!

It has decent graphics and the environment is original and cool, but the gameplay is either too difficult for me or the learning curve is high.
