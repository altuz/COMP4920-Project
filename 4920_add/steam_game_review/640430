I wouldn't even take this game even if it were free.\n\nI'm a big fan of roguelikes and I know a good one when I see it.... this isn't it. \n\nThere isn't much to do with your heroes at all.   I'm not sure if you get more much later on but in the near 2 hours I've played you can only either do 1 special attack or spell and that's it.  You can form a \"party\" but it doesn't make the game any more exciting. \n\nWhen progressing at whatever your current pace is, you basically run into a wall and you cannot get past it no matter what and you will have to die and start over.  Simply put, you'll run out of mana and then you will meet up against a critter that you will continue to miss and miss and miss until you die.\n\nEnemies that attack you first.  I don't know who thought of this idea... Why should the enemy ALWAYS get to attack you first?? I guess it's so you just don't run by the monster, but in that case why not make a trigger that happens if you get in melee range and then decide to move away that will damage you instead?  Why wouldn't I want to fight the enemy anyways? I need to kill it to get experience so I can get higher up and to get the reward for clearing the map. I just hate this concept soooo much I feel like I'm going to explode. \n\nThen you have quests that are somehow separate from the normal run.  You accept the quest and then you go on it and it's either you win or lose.  The worst part about it - they lock out any experience gain and potions!!  What?? WHAT!??  I don't get it?!! Why??? WHYYYYYYY\n\nSometimes you find a game and it sucks and then you move on.  This game sucks so bad I'm actually quite angry about the gameplay and design decisions.", "recommendationid": "34182310", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546585", "timestamp_created": 1502507749, "author": {"num_reviews": 125, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 95, "last_played": 1502507492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030893104"}, "votes_up": 38}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503421830, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 8, "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "The game is very light on the gameplay side, feels more like a mobile game then a pc title...", "recommendationid": "34171889", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510272", "timestamp_created": 1502468729, "author": {"num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 1084, "playtime_forever": 82, "last_played": 1502468655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993615631"}, "votes_up": 19}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502519573, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 15, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Hours of fun playing the same few minutes.

Furthermore, besides its obvious flaws which derive from its mobile roots, it stands bold\nand brave within a universe of similar games (dungeonmans, dungeons of dredmore, quest of dungeons etc.) only to \nmake a difference with its wealth of material and choices. Although until now I believe I have scratched just the surface\nof the game's levels and characters, I see the amount of work that has been done in every little detail. \n   It plays and feels like most turnbased roguelikes you have already played, and if you are used to similar game systems\nthe game will make you feel like home. When you begin you are at an overworld map with a town and some places to explore. The town allows you to unlock new characters, buy various upgrades and learn parts of the game's lore. The places to explore are 6 variants which are always the same on the map but with random dungeons when you enter. Each level ends fast, but the enemies progress in almost similarly as you \nmaking the game quite tough in my opinion. It has plenty of loot, plus various random mechanisms which you find spread\nin the dungeon that allow you to do some generic crafting. You also find shops specialized either in potions or in armor/repairs. Every 5 dungeons you meet a tiny boss followed by many minions, something that adds to the chalenge.\n   Gameplaywise it offers many ways of advancing and exploring, and if we add the unlockable characters we look at a serious amount of game time. Depending on the choice of character it can get kinda repetitive but  I suppose it is a constant of the genre.\n   In order to concllude the game is totally recomended especially for fans of the roguelike/tactical rpg genre. I was a bit hesitant when I first saw it at the store, but it worths every penny. You will definetely get many hours of gameplay out of it.", "recommendationid": "34361165", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508699", "timestamp_created": 1503184130, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 1465, "playtime_forever": 2051, "last_played": 1504979557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071839521"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502557788, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 8, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "perhaps the first thing that you notice when you look at this game is its design: everything is done greatly, thouroughly, thoughtfully, with attention to smallest detail: title, intro video, ui screens, etc.\nbut when you start to play you will understand everything in a game from a very first word of a story to a big complex world with lots of heroes, levels, places, quests, characters is done with pixel graphics - and this explains why there is so much care and pixel-exactness in its design :)\nperhaps the only thing i would like to be added to the game is some interactive intro-manual what to do where to click how to play ))) - things that maybe are obvious for rough-like fans were not so obvious to me as i'm definitely not a pro in both rpg and rogue-like genres.", "recommendationid": "34195696", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497350", "timestamp_created": 1502557788, "author": {"num_reviews": 240, "num_games_owned": 2596, "playtime_forever": 64, "last_played": 1502557335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110829497"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 5, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
