Because of the poor quality of video and audio in the trailer I was worried that this game would be a effortless cash grab. After a few hours I am happy to say that this is the best Lego game I've ever played. It runs smooth as butter except for a few times like when the characters got stuck or  when it CTD or froze. Otherwise no issues. Split screen is a major pain. Cut scenes from the movie are oddly cut mid sentence. All the Ninjago movie Lego sets for sale look super rad. The action is fast paced and gets faster as you progress.

I find the game as a whole to be fun and action packed, but it does have it's downsides.\n\nFighting on the Green Dragon Mech/Lightning Jet is a bit clunky (or maybe it's just not my thing). Voice acting for characters like Garmadon and Cole just don't seem to exactly click, especially during the cutscenes. Other than that voice acting is fine. As well as in certain locations, like the Beach, their isn't strong consistency. However this problem is very minor but would still fall under cons. The price is a bit overpriced, it's more like $30-37, but you can always refund\n\nThere are so many things I like about the game and it will have me hooked for a while. Combat is fun with the so many different options, so many ways to explore your environment, and also purpose to revisit levels as characters you unlock later in the game. This also helps to just relive the game in a new way, making sure it doesn't get old. I love how this theme is very consistent throughout LEGO games, and it's really enjoyable. \n\nHowever the game will not make sense if you haven't seen the movie and/or the show. Also side note about the movie: certain parts of the movie will not make sense if you haven't seen the show. Especially how Garmadon became the way he is because the explaination he gave in the movie doesn't do it justice. Anyway, there are a lot of pros to this game and I find everything about the game enjoyable besides the cons I mentioned, but you can easily pass over those (besides the aerial-combat one, that one bothers me a bit).\n\nAnyway, I say the game is totally worth it. It may be a bit pricey, but I assure you it's worth it. That's the only way I can say it. I thought it was pricey at first, and now i'm praising it in this review. After all, you can get a refund if you don't like it. It's totally worth a shot.\n\nOverall, it's a great martial arts tribute in a LEGO game. I would recommend it to anyone, even those new or unfamiliar with LEGO games and to those who are new to Ninjago/ the Ninjago Movie.", "recommendationid": "35164496", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526839", "timestamp_created": 1506202561, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 485, "last_played": 1506862385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 485, "steamid": "76561198087224933"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506144428, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 7, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've been waiting for a PC/Console Ninjago game for a while, and now we finally have one.

I apologize for Steam not saving that game time making me look foolish)\n*Will update this review as we try to get 100%!*  \n\n\nThis game is something my son has been anticipating since he was about 2 years old playing his first video game.  He is now 5 years old and when I told him that this game was in development he about pooped his pants with excitement along with me.  I am always aprehensive of movie versions of games but this one is great for the price of $40 so far!  \n\nThis universe has always been one of our favorites and this game is no exception!  The combo combat system is something that was not as robust as it is in this game and you actually get something called \"Ninjanuity Tokens\" which allow you to upgrade some of your favorite abilities to give you more studs, increased attack range, and other cool mutators!  \n\n\nGameplay:  \n- So far we have blasted through a couple of the main story missions and it has felt like a really great Lego game compared to most of the \"movie\" versions of Lego games we tend to get.  This one has a full fledged list of characters to unlock, a robust free play exploring experience, and tons of customization options for your ninjas.  You unlock characters with Ninja Packs you find throughout the levels and as you unlock them you unlock their head, pants, shirt and weapons to be used to make your own custom characters (similar to how Lego Marvel does it but with more options!)  \n\nControls:\n- My 5 year old always plays with an Xbox controller because he is not skilled with a mouse and keyboard just yet.  The controller support in Lego games has always been superb and he has been playing them since as young as 2 years old making it possible for anyone to pick it up and figure out the controls!  The tutorial level is great at easing you into the new types of attacks and gameplay mechanics using visuals instead of text which is very helpful for my little dude.\n\n*HIGHLY RECCOMEND to anybody who loves the Ninjago universe!*\n\n\n\n(If you want to see some gameplay footage check out Part 1 of our upcoming 100% of Lego Ninjago Movie Game!)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZopZ8pX_qQ", "recommendationid": "35195664", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510669", "timestamp_created": 1506310577, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 43, "playtime_forever": 126, "last_played": 1506909530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "steamid": "76561197968911581"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506333916, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 10, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 12, "review": "I watched LEGO Ninjago movie.

And this one is pretty good all things considered. I'll be listing off various things about this game that I liked/ didn't like, and the features that it does and doesn't have, so chances are I'll hopefully answer any questions one may have about this game before buying it. So let's begin.\n\nThe story: If you've seen the movie, you've pretty much seen the game. It even uses clips from the movie in place of cutscenes, which works to some degree but I'll touch on that later. As such, the main story follows that of the film, and while it does leave some things out, it also places a lot in. For instance, you get a lot more character with Jay when you play as him and Lloyd in the second act. And it makes the film just a little bit weaker in comparison, and I kinda like that, as I mentioned before, it gives him a bit more character. There are other scenes like that, but sadly not many.\n\nVoice work: I'll be honest when I say I really don't know to much about this department, and have never really reviewed it before, but if you're expecting Michael Pena to be voicing Kai in this, then you're gonna be dissapointed, because as far as I know, none of the voice actors from the film appear in this game. The actors that do appear in this game try their best to imitate their film portyals and of which they do to a certain extent. You can clearly see (hear?) this in Garmadon, whenever he say's La-Loyd. It just doesn't feel right, and the fact that they're using clips from the actual film and having these actors \"dub\" over it just feels wrong. And after seeing the movie (twice) and then playing the game and recalling how the voices should sound, it just feels like a piece was missing from the instructions. (I'm sorry, I had to make a pun.) Regardless of who is voicing them though, they still do an alright job pulling off the characters and making them enjoyable to play as. Also don't expect anyone to say anything when in free-roam, that's been left out sadly.\n\n Controls: If you've played past Lego titles on the PC, then this one should really feel no different. Keys are awkward and layout is pretty much the same. If you use a controller (XBox like I do) then you'll probably have a much better time with this game. Some mechanics from past Lego games have been implemented such as the dodge ability (RT and LT on a controller) that allow you to evade enemy attacks and instead of pre-determined moves like in Avengers, you now have several attack styles to use, such as the Rushing Boar (tap X on controller and use L-thumbstick towards an enemy) and the Skyward Dragon, which allow you to raise your combo meter even higher than in past games. And the more you raise your meter, then bigger multiplier for studs you'll get. The place you really see this come to frutition is in the arenas, which I'll talk about later.\n\nLevels: I could've talked about this when talking about the story, but it didn't fit in in any way that felt right, so I decided to just make it a seperate topic. Reason is is because in truth, there are no levels. And by that, I mean there are no story-exlusive stages where you're dragged out of the map, and placed into a different one. The chapter you play is also the map you play on. Kinda like Assassin's Creed. And what this does is it effectlivly makes the environment you play in much more memorable, which is kinda neat in a way, esspecially with the Docks. The big downside to this, and one that might hurt some opinions on the game, is that there are no longer any Mini-kits or True-___ collectibles. (i.e. True Jedi for Lego Star Wars) In place of the True-___ stud meter is a simple level up bar that fills up with the Lego studs that you collect, and while still called True-Ninja bar, it only serves as a level up gauge that once leveled up, unlocks some customization parts. There are no replacements for the Mini-kits, which has been a long time staple for the Lego games, but given how they made the actual maps the levels themselves, I can kinda see why they did it. Apart from that though, there really is no limit to what you can do inside of a story mode mission so long as you have the right character. Granted you can't accept side-quests while in a story because you can't, but you can go out of your way in the story to collect a Gold Brick, pick up Red Brick, or even snatch up a mini-figure bag (Yes, bag. They're like blind bags now and it's really cool.) And mind that everything you unlock is free, which kinda negates having a True-Ninja bar in the first place. The only things studs are used for are for Tornado of Creation Builds, which do cost a shiney stud when first playing, but other than that, you don't use studs at all. There are some side-levels, called Dojo's, where you'll be required to gain a certain amount of studs to unlock all 3 characters, but those are pretty easy to get. The Dojo's themselves are also pretty nice, taking place outside of the map in a themed area and have you going up against some of the show's main villians.\n\nGraphics: It's a Lego game. They look like Legos. But the game does look really good, blending Legos and real-world environments to make it believable.\n\n Arenas: Basically the multiplayer part of the game aside from normal 2-player co-op, Arenas do what Battle Mode did back in the day of Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga. Only now it can hold up to four players. And while there are only 3 modes, Samurai Showdown, Mystic Bounty, and Ulitmate Ultimate Weapon. Samurai is basically capture the flag, and the more flags you hold, the slower you go until you can get them to your base. Mystic is an orb collecting mode, with various orbs scattered throughout the map that vary in points. UUW is where you hold onto the UUW and earn points. Whoever holds onto it the longest wins. For all games, it's really who gets the most points wins, and they're fairly easy, against the ai bots that is. At the moment, there are only 3 maps, and I don't know if there will be more for I don't even know if there will be dlc for this game. But the maps are based in Ninjago City, the Uncrossable Jungle, and the Unclimbable Mountain, each being the same in each mode. There are also items that can be used to your advantage in each, but none are exclusive to a map, Now these modes are most definatly fun, as I find myself going back to them just to see what I can do, and I would totally like to see this area be expanded upon should there be dlc released.\n\nCharacter List: Probably the only other disapointing thing about this game is the lack of characters. While it does feature main characters from the show such as Kai in his Season 2 outfit and Pythor, it only features just about one of each character, which is a shame because of all the great outfits that the Ninja wore throughout the seasons along with upgraded color schemes that some villians got as well. At present, there are a total of 101 characters, not including the custom ones, and a locked character that has yet to be revealed, even at 100%. And there are some characters that I would have loved to play as such as Season 5 Cole in his Ghost form, or the Titanium Ninja, and some characters such as Classic Zane and Cole could've really benifitted from using their classic weapons instead of their movie counterparts gear. Should they release dlc in the future, I will hope that it includes more of their outfits and more gear, just to add to the overall.\n\nCustomization: As with pretty much all Lego games, you can customize your character pretty much however you want. I will say though, the department sadly feels lacking. I was limited to what color of what hair I could use (not a lot of blonde options) and not many things look good with each other.\n\nOverall, I would say go and get it. On PC at least, as it is a fairly small game compared to past ones, and for $40, I think it's a fair price. Hope this helps anyone who's looking to buy this game.", "recommendationid": "35279159", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505461", "timestamp_created": 1506649922, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 57, "playtime_forever": 1343, "last_played": 1506639289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1343, "steamid": "76561198070462792"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506191990, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I actually really liked this game.
