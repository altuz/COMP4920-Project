For me it is not the kind of game I can play for hours and hours, but it really shines as a nice side-game for whenever you have some minutes left to spare. Or some more minutes if you're feeling competitive and want to beat your friends' times! ;)\n\nLoading times are fast and movement is smooth like butter. As you have come to expect in this genre of games, once you die you're real fast back in game for your next attempt. #FrustrationFreeZone\nThe soundtrack is nice and suits the game well (ironically the title/trailer song is the one I like the least)\n\nDepending on your style of play you can sink a lot of time into this game. On the other hand if you're happy with just making it through a level with no desire to get a four or five star rating... you're probably missing out on some of the fun.\n\nPS: If you ever wanted to be on top of a leaderboard, try your luck while there's still room!", "recommendationid": "35050911", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505760450, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 343, "playtime_forever": 215, "last_played": 1506713572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "steamid": "76561197991837533"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505568790, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great challenge game that reminds me of Meatboy.
