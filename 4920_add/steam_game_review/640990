It's hilarious ;).\n\nFLML was a surprise. I bought the game with little to no expactations given the few (and rather bad) R+18 Otome-examples and their \"quality content\" I played in the last couple of years with [spoiler] lots of rape, maniacs to pursue &/or totally dumb & passive protagonists[/spoiler]. \n\nIt is an Otome game, which means you play as a female character and your goal is to \"capture the heart\" of one boy that the game throws at you within its story (in this games you have 2 guys to get in their pants, yay. More about them later).\nIf you want to have access to the R+18 CGs you have to download a patch though, which requires you to register on the Mangagamer site. But you don't have to pay for it and it is very easy to install - so shout out to MG for that.\nI'm a big, old perv so I played the game with the patch. I don't know how it would play out without it - so your experience might  differ from mine in the end.\n\nAt first I thought \"Man, 20 bucks just for story with 2 guys might be a bit expensive\". But you get really good quality content. The voices are the japanese voice overs. They are really well made and the voice actors are all no strangers to their field of work. You might know them from other Otomes or Animes. Even NPCs with small text passages are voiced. What I found interesting was that the protagonist was voiced as well, I think it is just the second otome game I played with a voiced female protagonist. So I was a bit bewildered at first because I needed a bit longer to connect with her. And sometimes her voice was straight out annoying. So I was thankfull that you could mute all voices in the system menu at any given time.\n\nThe style of graphics was rather good and has a very distinctive style. You can like it, but I would understand if some say \"Nah, that is not so my preferred style\". But man, if I would draw that, a 3 years old child would do a better job than me. \nHere and there I noticed things  like  faces which looked a bit different in the CGs than while in dialogue mode. The backgrounds were clean and well painted as well - not so mushy like in all the handyports that spook around here on Steam.\nYou have a good amount of CGs with every guy that focus mostly on both: the protagonist & the guy - which means this story could be interesting for the VN reading guys as well.\nTo a degree that is a small critique point for me though because if I play a game for females, I want to see the guys in focus, not the big melons of the protag. Fight me. Wait, maybe I'm just weird.\nBut the CGs were nicely & tastefully done, so that complaint isn't thaaatt big of an issue for me in the end. \n\nThe story was refreshing. It is one of the games where it was really fun to find all the hilarious endings - and there are a lot. And all of them are enjoyable and totally hilarious.\n\nYou start at your typicial highschool but I kind of forgot instantly that I played a highschooler. Thanks to the writers I had the first time in my life the joy to play a girl as MC that was a lot like me, so I could relate to her very much. [spoiler]The MC was rather huge in person - at least for a japanese girl I think, which led to big mobbing issues in school. She was damn lazy, full of herself with a knack to missunderstand others on a massive quirky scale, uninterested in social contacts and totally stressed out if she was forced to that, she loved eating and wanted nothing more than her alonetime. That doesn't mean that she didn't have likeable traits as well - so she was honest, could stand up for herself & others &  tries to support the people she likes, even if they annoy the hell out of her and she struggled sometimes with finding the right words. She has her own ideas of things and knows right from wrong. And she likes teasing. [/spoiler]I welcome more such protagonists in the (R18+) Otome game genre. >>> Blank/ dumb passive slates: Sayonara! *throws trash out*\n\nThere was much more focus on all  the character personalities, their communication with one another and the fashion work. They were all quirky and hilarious and very consequent in their weirdo behaviour all the time. Even the NPCs had over the top personalities, which I liked. Here and there I missed possible npc communication with family members like Miki's sister or Seito's mom. \n\nAt  the beginning I feared that I was thrown into the deep pit of bad rom-com. But especially the guys grew on me and surprised me in a lot of ways.\nI feared Saito would be one of those [spoiler] maniac rapists I met in other R18+-games & Amnesia (look at you Toma \u00d2.\u00f3), but nope: in Miki's route he was more like a caring and overstressed  mom who kicks your damn lazy ass in time of need which I really liked. In his own route he was a massive dork with lots of complexes to overcome. He is very demanding though and never loses his sadistic side to a degree- put me off a bit especially if you think about how much he cared for the protagonist all the time. Though I must add her own personality destroyed lots of situations that would be potentially more romantic if she wasn't such a jerk herself at given situations....he really has to put up with a lot. Poor Saito. [/spoiler]\n\nMiki on the other hand was a [spoiler] huge M. In a lot of ways...:D Like Saito, he cared deeply for the protagonist and his story evolves into a really fantastic romance in the end. I really enjoyed all the fluff & cheese thrown at me. The relationship development between the MC and him was really well written and the focus was much more on the development of both characters to overcome problems and emotional hurdles together to suceed in work life and family in the end. Really mature - a big surprise for me given that (again) it was a story about highschoolers - and Miki + MC are both huge, dumb, loveable weirdos. What surprised me in his route as well was that in the H-scenes he was very caring.\nHe asked the MC a lot how she felt, if everything was to her liking etc. Something you don't find that much in R18+games - especially with female protagonists. [/spoiler]\n\nThe story length got me surprised. In my first run I needed ca. 6 hours for the complete Miki route. My second run for Saito was 3 1/2 hours because of me abusing the skippedy skip function. A small complaint here as well: lots of parts in both routes were the same like in the other. Their routes were not so distinctive as they could have been - even the third run with the [spoiler] Threesome-ending [/spoiler] was more or less just a short new part glued at  the end of everything you already read before. \n\nI know, I'm a bitter person. Or just too old for this, don't know. It is a cultural thing as well, I think. And it is a bit ego as well.\nIt is common in asian VNs - like using choices to determine routes and endings rather than using choices to shape the personality of the protagonist or providing other story bits/solutions for the given story without fearing death endings as consequences (I think if you want to play those not so angsty Otome you still need to read western indie [spoiler]R18/Otome like \"Wilder- Ran's story\", \"Aloners\" or \"The lady's choice\" [/spoiler]. \n\nThat doesn't mean I hate asian otome. No, I'm really fond that they exist.  I  play those games because I really like the stories and characters and to develop such games takes a lot of work and passion, which I aknowledge. And I'm happy to spend time far away from stress in them - so thanks for that.\nI just wish companies would acknowledge/appreciate their clientel a bit more and evolve with the times slowly but steady.\n\n I hope you'll enjoy the game as much as I did.

Props to the translators making all of those puns work. Every \"bad\" end goes completely off the rails. \n\nThe protagonist is honestly a dumbass, but not in a way that frustrates me. Normally protagonists that are prone to \"misunderstandings\" get on my nerves, but Ema takes it to such an extreme that it's enjoyable. Watching her come to the conclusions that she does is really something to see. \n\nThe voice work in this is also incredible!

A lot of the jokes are based on wordplay and cultural references, and you can tell someone had a blast adapting them.\n\n- The fashion angle is just a setup for a silly premise; the game doesn't go into much detail about it, which could be disappointing if you were expecting more.\n\n- I love the protagonist and her great sense of [unintentional] self-depricating deadpan humor. Not a huge fan of the voice actress, though; she sounds way older than the character is supposed to be, and her shrieking is like 5x the volume of her normal dialogue.\n\n- Decent length (I finished it in about 8 hours, but it might be more like 12 if you let every line of dialogue play out completely). The individual romance routes are a bit short compared to the common route, but I felt the game overall was paced well and didn't drag.\n\n- I hate how in some romance games, it feels like the protagonist and their love interests are the only people who exist in the world, so I appreciate the small cast of side characters with sprites, voice acting, and a few memorable personalities, even if they don't play a big role in the story. (Also I totally want to romance Mao.)\n\n- Criticisms of  the body negativity and Saito's constant negging are totally valid. YMMV on whether the tone and premise are ridiculous enough for the humor to still work.\n\n- Some questionable anatomy in the H-scenes. (Removing mosaic censorship isn't always a good thing. Now I can't just imagine the artist knew how to draw a vulva.)\n\n- Despite the game's teasing of S&M elements, the sex scenes are very vanilla. That's what I expected and not a downside for me, but I do wish there had been a bit of role reversal in Saito's route like there was in Miki's. \n\n- The threesome route was a major disappointment. Instead of a good poly ending, it's just that the protagonist can't choose between the guys, so she dates both of them and everyone is unhappy. At least there's some after stories so it wasn't my final impression of the game.\n\n\nOverall, despite some nitpicks, I enjoyed this VN a lot and would recommend it.

The comedic timing of the voice actors is splendid, I especially enjoyed Saito's spluttering whenever something crazy happened.\n\nThere were many laugh out loud moments for me!\n\nThere's a free adult patch on the publisher's website. It's my first time playing an R-18 otome game. If you're expecting something traditionally otome elements, you're out of luck. This game does not strive for that 'doki-doki' feeling of being romanced by hot guys. Instead, it tries to make you laugh, and sometimes you get thrown into a random sex scene. The sex scenes are alright, although the CGs throw me for a loop because they can't keep a consistent face for the characters so they look different each time. The balloon breasts are also a pretty big turn off.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good, for the guys. The MC screeches so much during the sex scenes though, it was like hearing nails on chalkboard for me. Thankfully you can mute individual voices.\n\nSpeaking of the MC, she's a pessimistic foreveralone gal, and easily misunderstands (with hilarious results) what people are saying. She keeps thinking Saito is part of the yakuza (gang members), so she keeps muttering stuff like \"of course you'd know that, you have connections ...\" and Saito is like \"... Wait, what?\" Easily some of the best moments!\n\nThe plot is ridiculous, but the entire thing is ridiculous, and Fashioning Little Miss Lonesome runs with it and tries to get you to laugh.

Every situation they encountered, the trio always have a knack of turning it into something funny, whether it's through their actions, reactions or conversations. I even got a laugh out of muting or un-muting the characters in the settings, which would prompt them to say some really funny stuff, like Miki will ask if you're muzzling him because it's a sex thing or something LOL! \n\nStories with too many endings tend to put me off but I couldn't get enough of the endings in this game because they are just so hilarious, even if some are really totally random. It helped that there is a \"skip to next choice\" button, which is really a time saver when replaying for the different endings. \n\nI also like how the language wasn't censored or \"toned down\". Granted, there are a lot of cuss words thrown here and there ever so often (especially by Saito) which maybe some people might find offensive? But I don't really care because I think it's very reflective of how some of us speak in real life and also because it made Saito's exasperation all the more hilarious. \n\nThe sprites are decent and have a range of expressions including some really novel and funny ones, like MC's censored duck face LOL. There are also a fair amount of CGs and the mature content CGs are uncensored. Yup, name me another game where the H contents are not censored but MC's duck face is LOL. Almost all of the CGs have expression/movement/posture changes to go along with the story or conversation and you can access them all later in the \"Extra\" gallery afterwards. \n\nThe \"Extra\" also include collections of adorable chibi CGs and scene replays, music and voices. You can actually \"favorite\" the voices while reading the story by clicking on the heart icon and save it to the voice collection for replay later. I only realized that much later so you bet I'll be replaying the story to save all the cool voices and funny quotes LOL. So two thumbs up for all these extras.\n\nSpeaking of voices, I have to say that I'm impressed. The voice acting is really top notched. There was a scene where Saito yelled at the MC (yet again) and midway yelling he is just like oh fuck this I'm done and you can actually hear the \"resignation\" creep in. Like a deflating balloon. Soooo good it's creepy. The voice actors really got the nuances down. I got a kick out of Saito's constant yelling (and Miki's begging) LOL. Plus, it was also a nice surprise to see the MC voiced as well. \n\nI think the story and voice acting alone are more than worth it. Lots of laughs, lots of fun. And it's entertaining as hell. I didn't start out \"falling in love at first sight\" with these guys but I grew to like them over the course of the story. Personally though, I'm leaning more toward the S camp, aka Saito, even though I also find M camp Miki to be adorable. Welp, I probably like 'em sadists.\n\nThe only cons I can think of this game is that there are only two date-able guys. Of course, quality is always better than quantity but truth be told, I'd have love to date Marin too LOL! \n\nOn a side note, I think it was pretty awesome of the developer/publisher to offer the adult patch as an addon for free for those who enjoy mature content. I didn't had any trouble installing it and I liked that I could easily switch the H-content on or off with just a click of the button in the game after it was installed. I hope the developer/publisher will consider translating and bringing Kami-sama Nante Yondenai to Steam as well!\n\nAll in all, no regrets buying this game and I don't want to spoil anything but I'd STRONGLY recommend completing the game and unlocking ALL the achievements.

They are [i]savages[/i] sometimes in their reads, and the game can get quite meta.\n\nThe common route is pretty long and there are lots and lots of joke endings. \nI liked Miki's route the most. He's very intense and that works well with Ema, the MC, since they share social clumsiness and general weirdness. He was extremely sweet during the H-scenes, constantly checking on her.\nWhile I like Saito as a character, as straight main of the trio, I didn't really care for his route. It's not as bad as I read some reviewers describe it, but it's not really fulfilling in the romance department, and his H-scenes aren't kinky enough to make me care for them. They have undertones of forcedness that might turn off some.\nThe 3some route, unlocked after getting the first 17 endings, was [i]okay[/i]. A campy bonus to contextualize some H-scenes, but really too short to be considered a proper route.\n\nThe only reasons you might not want to read Miss Lonesome are some TWs: social anxiety gets played off for laughs; the guys are quite forceful towards the MC in changing her (which include dieting with a side dish of fat shaming); the H-scenes in Saito's route can feel a bit rapey and the premise for the 3some route is as well.\nIf you think you won't mind the TWs, it's a very nice break from the usual overly tragic VNs with half of a school as the cast and hidden supernatural elements.", "recommendationid": "34927400", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507210", "timestamp_created": 1505337540, "author": {"num_reviews": 63, "num_games_owned": 174, "playtime_forever": 811, "last_played": 1505253849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198133148069"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505458041, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 47, "comment_count": "15", "votes_funny": 5, "review": "Here we go, I'm writing my first ever negative review. I wouldn't normally do this, but this game was just terrible. There were some enjoyable aspects of the game, but there were just as many issues I had with it, if not more. Prepare, this will be long.\n\nI'm reviewing the steam copy with the free adult patch added to it. Please note that I have only completed about 75% of Saito's route and none of Miki's. \n\nI honestly am not sure I can finish it because of how upsetting it is. I'll start with the best aspects of the game and progress to the worst.\n\nTranslation: 10/10\n\nThe translation is wonderful and appeals to many western memes and jokes. I hardly found any awkward parts of dialogue that were lost in translation. \n\nVoice acting: 8/10\n\nIt is rare to find a VN with such love and enthusiasm put into the voices. I loved all of them (especially Saito's) but I absolutely couldn't stand the MC. She spends 80% of the game whining, wailing, grunting, and groaning. Also, her shrill voice during the adult scenes was so terrible I had to turn it off.\n\nComedy: 7/10\n\nI feel the need to create this section for this game specifically. I found myself laughing out loud in a few of the scenes, especially the mushroom and aerobic step ones. \n\nArtwork: 6/10\n\nThe art was very average. Most of the sprites were done decently, but Saito's expressions and many of the CGs look weird. The few background scenes were done well.\n\nSoundtrack: 5/10\n\nAgain, very average. There are ~15 songs and they get the job done in most of the scenes, but sometimes the music felt innapropriate. Some of the soundtracks started grating on me after a few hours.\n\nStory/Pacing: 2/10\n\nThe second-worst thing in the game, and obviously a large part of it. The common route is about 6 hours-- WAY too long for a common route. I was sitting around waiting for some romance to actually happen. Once Saito's route started, I counted one time that he was romantic and then after three hours they suddenly have sex. The rest of the time, he just treated her terribly. \n\nSex: 1/10\n\nTheir first sex scene was awkward and literally came out of nowhere. No romance, no build up, no sweetness. Isn't this supposed to be an Otome game? Also, I imagine the MC is probably a virgin. There was absolutely no discussion of this AND they didn't use a condom. Ugh. I'm not usually one to nitpick details but this was just unrealistic. Also, it was surprisingly vanilla considering how much they advertised Saito's \"sadism\".\n\nOverall tone: 1/10\n\nThe absolute deal-breaker for me.\nThe game is very negative on body image and self-esteem.  The MC is constantly pressured to stay fit and criticized for her diet. She's  called \"piggy\" \"sow\" and \"dumb b*****\" almost every scene by Saito. It was beginning to feel extremely  degrading, frustrating, and sexist. I don't know how we are supposed to like him at all. He is a disgusting character and cruel. I get that he is supposed to be a \"sadist\" but there is a fine line between that and just being a jerk. There is a bad ending where the MC overeats and gains weight. The guys get so disgusted they drop her. Seriously? This is a game for women?\n\nFurthermore, the MC suffers from social anxiety and low self-esteem. Whenever she expresses her frustrations or says something self-deprecating, both of the guys  ignore her and Saito even makes fun of her further. Great.\n\nOverall: 5/10 or 2.5 stars\n\nI'll probably attempt Miki's route, but I dont expect it to go well. I understand that this game is supposed to be a comedy, but most of it was not funny--just horrible and negative. It is also hardly an Otome or romance of any sort. \n\nEDIT: Look, I personally didn't like this game. If you want to try it out for yourself, get the demo. I'm not forcing you either way. Many people loved the game. Maybe you will too.\n\nIf you don't think this game is for you, look for Cinderella Phenomenon or Amnesia on Steam.", "recommendationid": "34892381", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521039", "timestamp_created": 1505174793, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_forever": 595, "last_played": 1505088252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198243300976"}, "votes_up": 54}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505165853, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game may not be that long but it's awesome - now if only I could get a good BL game...\n\nI love the sadist and masochist otome dudes - this is hilarous and fun!\n\nGreat plot and great writing and other stuff :D", "recommendationid": "34890739", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505165853, "author": {"num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 118, "playtime_forever": 355, "last_played": 1505599381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198170869129"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505254883, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Well it was entertaining.

The Slice of life with mild plot, combined with a lot of humor and slapstick is so nice to see. It's actually been quite some time since I last laughed at an otoge.\n\nWARNING, THERE'S A LOT OF CONS TO THE GAME AS WELL\n\n-It advertises S&M, but you rarely get that, at most it's softcore with a lot of common dirty talk.\n-Saito is kind of a jerkwad at times, so if you only want love and romance, I don't think this is a game for you.\n-This game, while being an otome game, can tend to lean (quite a bit) on the nukige side (a game meant for men to get easy porn material). While the MC is female, I can see how this appeals to both genders because of the humor and sexual content.\n-I really loved the translator's ability to localize the comedy, but sometimes I was offput by the switching of english words to spanish for \"foreign language\" sake, but that's just me nitpicking.\n\nOverall, a good game with not too much sweetness, but just enough love.\n\n\n[spoiler]Saito \"F u ck boy\" Shinjou[/spoiler]", "recommendationid": "34896747", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501507", "timestamp_created": 1505202747, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 1243, "last_played": 1505259653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071736633"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505899312, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Well! The opening says the guys are awful, and boy, are they [i]ever![/i]\n\nAbove all else, this game is hilarious and totally self-aware. I laughed out loud numerous times, even directly after I was left cursing the game's two (massively annoying and totally punchable) suitors. If you're going to play this, I'd do it mainly to experience just how incredibly silly it is rather than for the romance. It's definitely secondary to the nonsense the leading trio get up to, and I'd recommend it on that alone. The boys are huge, annoying idiots, the player character has a distinct personality and is (almost always) just as capable of throwing it back as she is of taking it, playing off of them fairly well. The script does not insult the audience by placing them in control of a gently cooing ingenue. Your player character is (rightfully) annoyed and snarky. There ought to be more characters like her (and writing like this) when it comes to otome games! (As others have mentioned, however, the \"suitors\" are forceful and absolutely will not let the heroine get out of their harebrained scheme to change her and turn her into a model, leading to all sorts of infuriating situations. I wouldn't recommend this if you are particularly sensitive to any of the situations you've seen highlighted by others.)\n\nMoving along...\n\n\nThis game looks fantastic, for the most part. The title screen, the menus, and everything having to do with the system looks absolutely fantastic. It's colorful and dynamic, with great integration of the \"fashioning\" theme with the fabric scraps here and there. It's just really, really great to look at--which is more than I can say for the sprites of Miki and Saito, who... don't exactly look 100% right. They're fine in CGs, but as far as the sprites go a lot of the [i]girls[/i] that show up make better bishounen than them. Saito seems to have it a little worse than Miki, who just looks... dopey. Saito's shocked face and :Y face in particular are the worst. Because of how silly their sprites both tend to look, it's easier to accept them as comedic protagonists than romantic ones.\n\nComedy is where this story shines. It's hilarious. I've already said this, but I feel like I need to repeat this: This story is [i]far[/i] funnier than it is romantic. I'd say the highlight of it aren't the good ends, but the pleathora of joke endings. Trying to get as many of them as possible was what I was focused on for a good while, they're all worth at the very least a snicker. (Hell, I'd consider some of these joke endings to outright be [i]better[/i] than the actual endings.) The story is so heavy on comedy and the suitors are just so [i]awful[/i] that in my opinion it made it feel like the romantic moments just... came out of nowhere. Miki in particular has a very jarring romance. One moment you're laughing, the next you're apparently supposed to feel something. It's pretty odd. Saito feels a little more well-rounded, but... it's still Saito. In the end I'm not sure what the protag sees in either of them, but... hey. It's an otome game. This sort of thing happens.\n\nThe voices are okay. Miki can get kind of annoying, as can the protagonist, but it's nothing that turning them down a little (or off completely, if you'd like) can't fix. My main gripe is the gross ASMR smoochy kissy noises. Look... nobody needs to hear that. I'm going to be real: It sounds like someone desperately trying to suck a stuck starburst off of the back of their front teeth. I didn't go and download the R18 patch so I don't know what went down during the love scenes, but if there were this many overly wet sounds in the all-ages version I dread to think what totally bizarre sardine-in-a-mayo-jar SPLORTCH sounds took place.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this game. Saito and Miki are ([i]really[/i]) exhausting, but the fun was worth it. It's definitely not for everyone--an appropriate way to put it is that this game is the otome version of a \"teen sex comedy.\" It's super-silly, kinda dopey, kinda lewd, the main trio all have various things that are really unlikable about them, but there's humor and heart in it... and if that's what you're looking for, you'll find it here.\n\n(A note: There's no way to change the keybinding for this game as far as I can tell, which can make it troublesome if you'd like to screenshot something since F12 quickloads.
