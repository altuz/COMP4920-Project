I want to support this developer because I can easily see that he has put in a TON of hard work already, but it is buggy and very incomplete as of his early access launch date.\n\n W A R N I N G : \nTHIS GAME IS VERY ROUGH AS OF EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH DAY, \nIS LOADED WITH BUGS, AND IS VERY INCOMPLETE.  \nPlease be warned of this, and only buy this to support the developer of if this is the kind of game you really love.\n\nHere's my first play game experience so you can better see what you'll be buying:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFRB2T0Nq-E\n\nRight now, the graphics are very pleasing to the eye for a isometric RPG game.  I wish that we had the ability to rotate the camera 90 degrees all the way around like the old UO, but hey.. it's not a big gripe.\n\nThe biggest bug I've experienced so far have been always failing to make the basic tools like a hatchet and basic pickaxe etc.  I bet I've tried 80 times to make a basic tool and haven't been successful once.  Finding that many rocks and sticks is time consuming and makes it a little frustrating when I can't even make a basic tool.\n\nOther minor bugs include being able to sell an NPC vendor more than 1 item at a time, but not being able to buy more then one item at a time, requiring you to click everyting many times, buying a single apple 20 times for example.  Another minor complaint is vanishing npcs and sometimes some npcs in town wig out in a corner as if they are trying to walk through the wall.  English grammar mistakes also are common, but a very minor complaint as it's easily understandle what the meaning is.\n\nSuggestions for immediate or quick resolve would be fixing the above bugs especially not being able to craft a basic tool and always failing, making the docks easily jumped onto from the water to allow shortcuts and time saving getting around, and either reducing the frequency of rainstorms or making it a little easier to see during a rainstorm because it's sooo hard to see through!\n\nThere is walled off boundaries preventing you from exploring much of the main land you start on, and until more content is added, I can see this game getting repetitive after maybe ten to fifteen hours of play,  But as he expands the game and the content, and if you can work with some minor bugs, I think this game is worth the price admission to any old school RPG fan, such as Diablo fans or Ultima Online fans.  Waiting for a few months to jump onboard might be a good suggestion for people who aren't huge old school RPG fans however.\n\nI will update my review as the game changes and gets updated, but right now I'd give it about a 6/10 due to the bugs and lack of content right now.  However that score will only likely go up as bugs get resolved and content is added slowly.\n\nI respect the hard work that is already very obvious by the developer however.  I'm on board for the long haul.  ;-)", "recommendationid": "35256960", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511294", "timestamp_created": 1506585822, "author": {"num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "playtime_forever": 145, "last_played": 1506593620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 145, "steamid": "76561198053422627"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506897243, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I recommend this with a caveat (read EA notes, especially):\nWhy Early Access?\n\u201cMy options are to release in EA or scrap the project due to the lack of funds. With EA I hope the people who want to play the game will help me to finish it!\u201d\n\nRecognize that if this doesn't get enough funding it will be another one of those great potential, but abandoned games.  I really do hope this makes it, but so far doesn't seem like it's getting enough attention.\n\nSofar, this game is a true alpha.  A concept, that I like, but needs much more content to be added.  Once that's in, a polish to get rid of non-critical bugs.  In that order.\n\nThis does have a lot of quirks and bugs...for example I had to stop and relaunch game, because crafting doesn't appear to work on your initial install/play.  The stuff you craft never gets added to your inventory.  However, if you quit and come back, it crafts.   The UI count of items seems wonky at times.  As well as when you purchase things, sometimes the increase/decrease count works sometimes it doens't.  To me, I don't care if this stuff works, cause I can sell things one at a time, and if you open/close your inventory the item count seems to be true, so there are work arounds.  I'd rather see these polished last, and get more content in right now.\n\nBut buyer beware...it's probably not worth current price, and with lack of backers, may get abandoned.  So you decide if it's worth investing or not. :)", "recommendationid": "35398258", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1506897243, "author": {"num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 4131, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1506883897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "steamid": "76561198017542605"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506805253, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1506806758, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": "9", "votes_funny": 0, "developer_response": "As i write on description, the game is an apha with bugs and glitch and buy only if you want to support.", "review": "Bought the game, faced some Gamebreaking bugs, reported it with EVERY detail in the \"bugs\" section under the discussion table.\n\nThey Responded fast for the first bug.\n\nGame itself seems very cool in terms of Ideas and playstyle.\n\nPros:\nI like the idea of an \"MMO\" completly sandbox based, no rules, NO Class Restrictions and starting with NOTHING from scratch. \nCrafting seems simple, but strong.

This is and isometic RPG. Why am I using WASD?\n- Beyond the wonky controls, movement is soft and swimmy. Doesn't feel right.\n- Even after figuring out movement, interactions make no sense. You have to hit E, then use your mouse to selecr the action from a sort of radial menu. This is even more jarring as the mouse has almost no other use!\n- I'll give the dev/devs the benefit of the doubt and assume that English is not their first language, as a great deal of the NPC text is practically nonsensical jibberish.\n\nFinal verdict:\nBack to the drawing board! \n\nIt might be okay some day, but wait a while.  A LONG while.  The graphics look nice enough, and even character customization is good, but world interaction is all wrong and needs to be completely redone.
