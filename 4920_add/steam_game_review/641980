This game beats Pixel Gun 3D 10 to 1. The game is great, huge variety of guns. Shotguns, sniper rifles, MG snipers, laser guns, grenade launchers, machine guns etc. There's also a decent amount of swords. Also there's no blood if you're worried about that (except when when you take damage some appears on the screen), when ever you shoot an enemy they explode into gold cubes which you can collect and use to buys things, so the game isn't gory at all. Huge variety of enemies also such as: dragons, wolves, zombies, mummies, pirates, roman soldiers, and almost anything else you can think about. In general it's a very good quality game for $10.\n\n      PROS\n- Good animations\n- large variety of guns\n- you can crouch and sight guns (which i was really happy with because with lots of games like this you can't sight a pistol or rifle)\n- You don't need a strong graphics card at all to run it decently. If you want it to run with no frame-rate drops at all (don't hold me to this) it says you need 1GB \n\n     CONS\n- After almost 8 hours of gameplay i'm starting to get bored with it. Each level is a different theme but the main goal is the same. Kill all the enemies then sometimes kill a boss.\n- I came up on ONE glitch the whole time i played, when i got stuck in a wall. Not a big deal because you just need to restart from your last checkpoint but it can be annoying having to lose a good deal of progress.\n- Even though it's pretty much constant action, once you kill all the enemies there isn't usually a notification on where to go (it sometimes comes up mid-battle and you don't notice it)\n\nOverall i would definately recommend this to a friend. The game only has a campaign right now, but if they changed a few things (when you sprint up a hill you kinda float up it instead of climb) and added online multi-player (once they had more users)... this game would be practically perfect.", "recommendationid": "34803426", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1504821843, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 538, "last_played": 1506195526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "steamid": "76561198354727170"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 20, "total_positive": 18, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
