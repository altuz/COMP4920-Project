The thing is, most of them have been fixed now!  But people don't bother to edit or delete their reviews, and so this amazing game is still being called out for its bugs and YouTuber endorsements, meanwhile, both are gone!\n[b]Major glitches:[/b] I have a solid 15 hours on this game in just over 2 weeks, and I haven't encountered NOT ONE of the major bugs listed in these reviews.  They've all been fixed.  A couple minor bugs, maybe, like someone floting on top of their bed, but prisoners and items changing randomly? That stuff is long gone!\n[b]Multiplayer saving:[/b] A lot of people don't like how your items are saved in multiplayer.  Each player gets a cell, and there is one cell for the first player who joins, one for the second, and so on.  If you join second, get items, leave and then join back, someone could have taken your spot, and would have your items.  Initially, I disliked this too, but eventually came to see it's purposes.  It can prevent people from taking everything on the server, and just leaving.  Everything in their desk would be replaced with an NPC inmate's items until that player rejoined.  What if they didn't?  This could've created a huge exploit for trolls, and as a result, multiplayer wouldn't be fun.\n[b]YouTuber and Streamer Inmates:[/b] One thing that even I disliked, was how NPC inmates could have YouTuber names and outfits.  Guess what?  Just recently, a feature was added to toggle these NPCs off!\n[b]\"Scripted\" Escapes:[/b] Some people didn't like these new escapes.  I really liked them.  Other people saw them as scripted, I saw them as something more exciting than a perimeter escape, and as a challenge.  It's true that it's just using certain items in a certain area, but it also adds some more variety to your escapes, and many of these new escapes require you to cooperate with another player.\n[b]Prison Editor:[/b] One thing that this game was definitely missing was a prison editor, and with a season pass available to purchase, things weren't looking good.  However, it was just recently announced that a prison editor would be available in a [b]FREE[/b] update!\n\nLastly, the game fixes a lot of things that were wrong with the first one.  The one thing that I'm going to mention, is how guards could trace everything back to you through some magical, all seeing eye.  Good thing that was changed...\n\nSorry about the rant.  I highly recommend the game!", "recommendationid": "34826202", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630138", "timestamp_created": 1504918372, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 38, "playtime_forever": 1039, "last_played": 1506302921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "steamid": "76561198272253823"}, "votes_up": 90}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505565049, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Alright, Escapist Escapist Escapist... The first game was amazing i loved it personally with all the prisons and the DLC maps man it was so good. The second game easily is better for reasons which i will be explaning. Firstly i will be explaining the big Pros for the game then the cons. So the Pros, One of the big things about Escapist 2 is that it has a ''Multiplayer'' Mode to it what basically changes the whole game. Having another player makes it so you have a completley diffrent escape with diffrent ways to escape each time. There are individual Items for the escapes and Cutscenes even what are really cool and in some cases hilarious. Some other things they have changed in the game are the gameplay aspects. The HUD Parts of the day, Fighting, AI interactions and a whole bunch more. The way they have changed all these are Such a Huge diffrence its crazy. I personally also love the tick system for the parts of day which makes it very neat. Also the GTA like Heat level wat is very fancy. Overall these are the main reasons i love this game. The levels, diffrent gameplay aspects and multiplayer.\n\nWelp now the cons.. Crashes, Lack of content, Multiplayer issues. These are mainly the big cons. When it comes to crashes these dont happen to frequintley but when they do it Sucks. These can happen in the middle of an escape or when your doing something important like making a key. I think they are currently Fixing the crashes what are amazing. Keep it up Developers :D \nNow lack of content. Currentley right now im getting extremely close to finishing th game AKA. finishing the last prison. Once you have done this and done the escapes for other prisons there is not much to do. You have versus mode (Which i hate :/) and thats really it. Although they will most likely be adding in more content this is a bit of an issue. Lastley Multiplayer issues. There are things in multiplayer which glitch the game. like joining into another players cell AKA. basically stealing there stuff and sometimes Huge lag in game which can result so extremely hard fighting and trouble getting around the prison. Stuff like this cant really be fixed (Lag) but it kinda sucks in multiplayer.\n\nOverall Amazing game and really cool multiplayer. if you have friends that are willing to play with you, 4 sure get this game. You wont regret it, 20$ very much well spent.

Where you can just screw with eachother whilst trying to pull off jobs, especially in the versus mode.\n\nI got a lot of hours in unlocking prisons with one friend, and then another (who had never played before) jumped in right in time for [spoiler] Area 17.

Honestly, I wish there were a 'meh' option. But, there's not. Aside from a few glaring issues, it's actually a pretty fun game. The new visuals are nice. It beats the style of the old game, hands down. The old style just felt lazy. You can make your own cons now. So that's fun. There's multiplayer, as well as splitscreen now. However, the negatives almost outweigh the positives of the game. While you can still have fun with the game, there are a few aspects that need nerfed, removed entirely, or changed.\n\nLet's start off with the obvious one. The dogs. In my opinion, they need to be completly removed, or heavily nerfed. They're invincible, and you can't even slow them down. They also keep attacking and hunting you once the lockdown is over. The dogs should either be entirely removed from the game, or atleast have something to counter them for the player. Maybe you could drop some food to distract them. Or knock them out. Or atleast reduce their speed, and ability to go anywhere the player can. There's pretty much no way to avoid them, as it stands. The second thing I think should be nerfed, or removed entirely, is the fucking medic. They serve a purpose, sure. They come and pick up knocked out players, prisoners, or guards. The problem is, like the dogs, they're about 2-3x faster than the player. So many lockdowns have been triggered because I was busy trying to craft a fake key, and the medic came along and fucked off with the guard. Then, when the guard woke, because I couldn't give them the key, a lockdown happened. Even if I drop the key, the dogs keep coming at me until they kill me. The two make a pretty overpowered pair. The medics cause a lockdown, and the dogs chew my fucking throat out. Then the medics come and take all my hard earned contriband. It's particularly rage inducing because once the dogs are out, you might as well surrender and go to solitary. Another thing that should be removed, are the silver doors. They literally block off entire sections of the map. In the first game, you could open them by starting a prison take over. That's been removed in TE2. You can still tie guards down, but there's no point. The medics will just swoop on by and take the guards, and flee. Another thing that should be fixed, is the RNG. I've literally been waiting 18 in-game days to find some fucking talcum powder. In the first game, it was so common that you were tripping over it every five seconds. In this game though, talcum powder is pretty much impossible to find. Meanwhile I can be roaming around with high end gear and materials out the ass. I can make enough super baseball bats to arm an entire prison, but getting some talcum powder is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.\n\nOverall, if those issues were fixed, I would recommend TE2. It's a fun game, but those can really ruin it, at the drop of a hat. Thanks to some fucking dogs, and a bunch of medics. The transport prisons are fun, and the new prisons are fun enough that you almost forget that RNGJesus hates you.", "recommendationid": "35067896", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509653", "timestamp_created": 1505838823, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_forever": 1274, "last_played": 1505944487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079679608"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505652075, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Better Than Ever Cant wait for the new Prison Editor", "recommendationid": "35022596", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508801", "timestamp_created": 1505652075, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_forever": 469, "last_played": 1505653514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198114415199"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505673051, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Wow.\nThey blew it out of the park.\nAfter originally watching YouTubers playing this game, I decided to buy it to check it out.

A LOT of game mechanics.\n\nPros:\n\n- Good replayability\n\n- Tons of content\n\n- Good pixel graphics (My opinion)\n\n- Funny\n\n- Good degree of difficulty\n\n- The achivements are fun to work up to\n\n- Lots of items, crafting, and things to do\n\n- Decently well-balanced system\n\nCons:\n\n- Multiplayer is laggy and generally won't work\n\n- Things take a long time\n\n- Having to wait for your heat to go down in really annoying\n\n- SNIPER TOWERSSSSSSSSSSSS\n\n- The guards accidentally foiling your seemingly perfect escape plan >:(\n\n- Wonky controls\n\n- Pretty high cost\n\n- Again, things take a very long time!\n\nSo yah. Good game, with a few kinks to work out. I wouldn't reccomend it to people who don't like games where they have to spent a long time getting used to the controls and systems, or are just in it for the multiplayer, but I would reccomend it to the people who are ok going solo, and minecraft and terraria player will like this, as it is, in a sense, sandbox.", "recommendationid": "35117162", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506041654, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_forever": 1742, "last_played": 1506630759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 713, "steamid": "76561198367505302"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 259, "num_reviews": 20, "total_reviews": 1152, "total_positive": 893, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
