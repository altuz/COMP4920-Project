Definitely the best space game I have played.  Played in on the original cd, so my hours are misleading.\n\nReal time, tactical, capital ship fleet management at its best.  14 years old and looks like it could have been released yesterday.  Would pay double for a true sequel. If you are interested enough to be reading this review, do yourself a favor and buy it."}]}
