Unforunately, instead it's a stand still wave shooter where most of the things you have to shoot are in a frontal cone ahead of you.  Sound guides you when targets are nearby and when you sould probably look back (to kill rabbits mostly).  Would have been smart if part of the difficulty was setting up a torch to see at night or picking up the ducks before the predators come to take them.  Something other than just finding the target.\n\nI'm not sure why there's two guns when you need 1 hand with an ammo clip so you can quickly reload and grab more ammo while you keep shooting.  You probably won't last long if you pick up both guns unless you're very skilled.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely amazing.  The gun seems to be on target.  Nice day and night cycle and nice weather events.  Sound is also very good.  Game has a lot of polish.  But it's only 1 map and you can't move and there's not a lot of enemy types or a tactic other than shoot on target quickly.  This game should at least have more weapons.  Bazooka?  Something to get us excited to play.\n\nI am recommending this game, but just barely.  I'm not sure it's worth $8 but at $6.39, I guess it's about 50/50 for the amount of content currently \n\nRating 5/10", "recommendationid": "34470396", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1503619540, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 31, "last_played": 1503856032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504124596, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Bravo.  Well done.  I love duck hunt and I forgot just how much I love it until I played this game... plus I got scared.  Duck Hunt plus scary nights in the jungle = good times.  I like the leader board too.  The changing envirnoment is nice.  The variety of animals was a cool suprise. Reload machanics simple and fun.  Listen, all in all 10/10.  But with all great games I feel it's my duty to give input to make it even better.  You ready?  Bigfoot.  I know I know you probably wanna keep it pure and thats fine.  Add a silly mode if you must but we all want to see bigfoot.  And big too.  Not king kong big but big.  Like 9 or 10 feet.  Enough to scare em. Maybe just an easter egg late game.  Anyways.  Love the game.  Keep creating.  Your game is beautiful and fun.  Thank you so much.

This is the Unreal Engine shining through I believe.\n\nThere are plenty of options for tweaking the visuals if your PC can't manage on top settings, but even if you dial the graphics back to low (to keep the framerate high) the game is still one of the prettiest I've seen.\n\nThe excellent audio is also worth a mention, from the storm effects to the cues for where the next target is coming from.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is straightforward, it really comes into its own by placing you in a believable environment with atmospherics dialed up to 11. The amount of detail shown around you from the fish in the nearby pond to the dragonflies zipping in and out of view really give you a sense of presence.\n\nFinally, the gun play itself is solid, aiming seems accurate, and the reloading mechanic is a satisfying process. Although you can dual wield the pistols, I much prefer shooting with one while holding a spare ammo clip for quick reloading.\n\nI'm hoping this gets some good sales to encourage the dev to build on the great platform already on display here.\n\nRecommended!", "recommendationid": "34488709", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1503690887, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 1398, "playtime_forever": 67, "last_played": 1503690735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979459473"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502813444, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A reimagined VR creation based on the classic Duck Hunt game, but with better graphics, weather effects, more animals to shoot and more ammo than you can shake a stick at!\n\nLiking the addition of the global leaderboard. Changing from day to night with the weather effects really adds to the atmosphere and mood of the game. Can tell a lot of effort has been put into making the rainforest location look realistic. Seeing red eyes coming at you in the dark is proper creepy, that was very unexpected, so a thumbs up from me on the little details like that.\n\nThe price being halved seems a lot more realistic now, the original price point was too high.\n\nCons:\nPicking up ammo is buggy, having boxes behind boxes is just awkward. 2 Guns seem pointless with having to put 1 down to reload.\nNot having sights you can see in the dark kind of ruined the night time part for me. Would have made it much further if I could actually aim the gun in the dark. Unloading full clips on a wolf and not hitting a single shot, even when it's only a few meters away from me was a tad frustrating.\nInability to recentre yourself so you can stand where you like in your playspace without clipping into the big rock where all the ammo sits.\n\nWishlist:\nStanding in 1 location starts to get old quite quickly. Moving into different locations within the scene would help keep the interest along with more variety from where the animals come from.\nDifferent weapons would be nice, as using that 1 pistol becomes boring quite quickly.\nMaybe the ducks could also try and attack you. A few angry ducks in attack mode would mix things up a bit.\nSnakes slithering through the grass would be quite unnerving, especially being able to hear them but also being hard to spot.\nLocations - Imagine sitting in a boat, slowly drifting towards the waterfall, having to shoot ducks flying over head, with crocodiles slowly sneaking up to the boat which if you don't spot them jump up the side to eat you. Maybe you could have a rifle in the boat which you could change to for some long distance shooting or a shotgun for those close encounters.\n\nI'll stop waffling now.
