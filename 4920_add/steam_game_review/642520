But this was a close one. This is a unity engine platformer just so we know. \n\nI liked this game (yeah, rare I know) because of what it promoted, what it promised and then what it failed to deliver which is why I am writting this review. The game itself is pretty straight forward, you have to cycle between 3 toons which all have various perks and using all 3 of your toons you must pass the stage by taking said toons to thier correct colored exit to advance. \n\nRed guy can move the fastest on the ground and has a decent jump. Can use bounce-pads and portals. Yellow guy can double jump and has a low gravity kind of feel to him, making great wigglespace and lastly the Blue guy, who is heavy to jump but can manipulate gravity to move on surfaces Red and Yellow couldnt. \n\nNow the downside, besides the 3 major ones, unity, shit map design and cheap spawns.....the developer is the biggest problem here. I (like many others) had one reason to get this game and 1 reason alone, 600+ achievements because I am a sick fella and I am criminal in title gets. This sleezy developer decided to make a chunk of achievements bugged, I mean across users in strange ways. I need 30 more for a 100% completion, as others need 40, 50 or even 65 achievements, we all have strange unlocks, rarely the same. \n\nTo be expected, the dev is not from england or america, (the best countries for developers obviously) ((\"And if you disagree I will fight you in my underwear\")) and has not bothered to contact users, answer threads or even hint to a patchnote fix or bug fix. AKA, make that dosh and leave.\n\nThis has been a heartbreaking day for me.", "recommendationid": "32630757", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507223", "timestamp_created": 1498090776, "author": {"num_reviews": 161, "num_games_owned": 1376, "playtime_forever": 108, "last_played": 1502295755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044229474"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497279908, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 28, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very cool platformer with many achievements.\n678/678", "recommendationid": "32366886", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446320", "timestamp_created": 1497279908, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 13, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1497281389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071197904"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 4, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
