If that were fixed this would have been a 30 minute experience. \n\nPuzzles: The puzzles were hit or miss... Some were interesting and took a little bit of thinking, but others just took a little guess work. The puzzles on the bomb didn't seem to have any clues towards their solution (other than the clock) so I spent 5 minutes just guessing them all.  Overall, for an escape the room game, this area is lacking. \n\nUI: I wanted to mention that I was very dissipointed that there was no pause option, and since there is no pause screen there is no way to restart the puzzle (Which is an issue since the wire cutters glitched out of the map and I had to take off my VR stuff and restart the game manually.)\n\nOverall, I would skip this game.", "recommendationid": "33725698", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503064", "timestamp_created": 1500744500, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 833, "playtime_forever": 51, "last_played": 1500739740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064587785"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503880030, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "The Murder Room VR is your typical Escape the Room game: no intro, no story, just puzzles leading to the exit. Unfortunatley it looks and feels like a beta version.\n\nFirst of all, [u]it looks nothing like in the trailer linked at the store page[/u], there's far less objects and puzzles in it compared to the video. The game itself contains a few unused items which make me think some content was cut before the release. The trailer shows a much more advanced and polished product.\nApart from that you can clip though walls, fly or go below the ground to some degree.\n\nThe game uses an unusual moving system, which at first made me feel weird, but I got used to it rather quick and got to like it in the end. For someone who's tired of the teleport movement seen in nearly every VR game, it's a nice change.\n\nGraphics is rather basic, I wouldn't be surprised if The Murder Room VR was built using Unity Store assets. There are barely any sounds in the game and they're quite annoying for most of the time.\n\nPuzzles are clever and interesting with some exception. The worst was the very last puzzle which would make you start the game from the beginning in case of a mistake. Unfortunately there's not that many of them and you can complete the game in about 30 minutes.\n\nI can't recommend this product considering its technical state, false advertising and its price while offering less than an hour of playtime.", "recommendationid": "34542097", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503700", "timestamp_created": 1503880030, "author": {"num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 4199, "playtime_forever": 79, "last_played": 1503877685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025257831"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502851129, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you want to get motion sick, buy this game.
