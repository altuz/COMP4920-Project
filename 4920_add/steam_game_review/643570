The ChoiceScript engine is also used by all of Choice of Games\u2019 games, as well as by all Hosted Games games (Hosted Games, despite being listed as a separate publisher in the store, is just a brand used by CoG).  If you haven\u2019t played any of the other ChoiceScript games, they play like a hybrid between RPGs and chose-your-own-adventure novels.  At each page, you are presented with a multiple-choice question about what your character does.  Unlike the paper CYOA books, you also have stats, which are altered based on your choices.  Some choices may seem to have no immediate effect on the story, but they can alter your stats, which can unlock certain options much further down the road.\n\tNow, I will warn you, since I know it will turn off a lot of gamers: [b][i]CHOICESCRIPT GAMES ARE ENTIRELY TEXT-BASED!  THIS GAME CONTAINS NO GRAPHICS OR SOUND OF ANY KIND.  IF YOU PLAY GAMES PRIMARILY FOR THE GRAPHICS, YOU SHOULD NOT GET THIS GAME.[/i][/b]\n\tOkay, are they gone?  Good, let\u2019s get on to the game.  Avatar of the Wolf is set in a dark fantasy world, which until recently was dominated by a pantheon of six gods:    Bear, Eal, Gazelle, Hawk, Spider, and Wolf.  The people of the world were also divided in to three tribes, called Clearwater, Highwalk, and Quietly Swimming (you get to choose your character\u2019s tribe in the first chapter).  Aside from your tribe, you will also quickly be prompted to decide on your character\u2019s name, gender and sexual orientation.  \n\tUp until right before the story started, your character was the titular Avatar of Wolf: a mortal chosen as a vessel by the god to manifest in the world.  But right as the story starts, Wolf has vanished completely.  The pantheon of gods now has only five members, and no one knows what happened to Wolf or even if he still exists.  Now, the remaining gods, and their followers, are squabbling over the remaining power.  There\u2019s also a faction of mortals called the Rising Sun, whose objective is to eliminate the gods altogether.  You are caught in the middle of everything.  Depending on your choices, you can team up with one of the existing factions, found your own, destroy the remaining gods or become a god yourself.\n\tNow, on to your stats in this game.  The stats page has your stats divided into four sections: Self, Skills, Disposition, and Favor.  Self includes the basic information about your character: name, gender, tribe, and orientation, all of which you decide in the first chapter.  Your tribe affects how some characters react to you.  Your orientation only matters if you want your character to pursue romance in the game.  I don\u2019t think your name ever has any effect on the story or the choices you are presented, aside from being spoken in the dialogue many times.\n\tNext up are your character\u2019s Skills.  Skills don\u2019t affect what choices you are presented with, but they do alter the effects of those choices.  Here\u2019s where Avatar of the Wolf becomes less like a paper-bound choose-your-own-adventure novel and more like a game.  Anyhow, the skills you get in this game are Survival, Combat, Ritual, Quick-Thinking, Sensitivity, Influence, and Restraint.\n\tThe next section of stats is your Dispositions.  This section includes two pairs of linked stats.  The first pair is Action/Deliberation.  Each can range from 0 to 100, and the sum of your Action and Deliberation is always 100.  You also have Selfishness/Equity, another pair of linked stats that always add up to 100.  Unlike skills, disposition effects what choices you are given.  For example, if your Action gets too high, you may be unable to take a choice that involves waiting.\n\tFinally, your character has Favor.  This section tracks your relation to various important NPCs and factions, including each of the remaining gods and the Rising Sun.  Having a positive relation with important characters can open up options much later in the game, and can have a huge effect on the ending.  This section of the stats page did occasionally shake my suspension of disbelief:  the game tells you if certain NPCs have a positive or negative view of your character, even if your character wouldn\u2019t know how they were perceived.  Normally I don\u2019t mind knowing information that my character doesn\u2019t in a game, but in this game, Favor is the only think you learn that your character wouldn\u2019t know.  Everything else in the game is presented entirely from your character\u2019s perspective, and this one exception through me off.\n\tAll in all, Avatar of the Wolf contains a richly detailed world and an intriguing variable storyline.  The wide range of choices means that you could easily play this game more than a dozen times without things feeling repetitive.  Or, at least, everything after chapter one wont\u2019 seem repetitive, since you need the first chapter to set things up.  You\u2019ll need to play through many times if you want all the achievements, and the game offers enough to make it an enjoyable experience.", "recommendationid": "34220416", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501850", "timestamp_created": 1502650925, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 2, "playtime_forever": 373, "last_played": 1504983622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198406784597"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 9, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
