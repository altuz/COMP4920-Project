I just think I didn't give it a fair chance. I'll update my review if and when I get the game again\n\nok I decided to go ahead and buy this golf game again and I have to admit I like it. compared to the golf club vr. everyday golf is alot more fun to play so far especially when you have back issues. the ball is alot easier to hit and I can actually hit the ball a good distance. unlike the golf club vr where half the time because of my back condition I can't even hit the ball more than 50 to 100 yards. but in everyday golf I can actually play the game with out back pain which is allways good. I'm still not doing vary good in the game but with more practice I think I could get better and have even more fun .right now the best score I've gotten is a bogey. in the golf club vr it takes so long to get to the green I usually get frustrated and soon give up. so all in all I would rate this golf game a 9 out of 10. hope this review helps other people .", "recommendationid": "34785838", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "timestamp_created": 1504745613, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_forever": 195, "last_played": 1506250499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "steamid": "76561198013848082"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "9 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 9, "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
