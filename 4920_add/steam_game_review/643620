Probably unlikely to make many new converts to the slightly more playable style of FMV game it presented there's never been a more appreciable version.\n\nSome of the more noteworthy additions to the new version, other than the new high quality video transfer\n[list]\n    [*]Awesome modern interface update, with realtime view of all the cameras\n    [*]Several documentaries and production bonuses\n    [*]A handful of deleted scenes\n    [*]The original proof of concept tech demo \"Scene of the Crime\" (never before made available to the public)\n    [*]Special randomised score attack mode\n[/list]\n\nHonestly for an old, rather critically lukewarm game, that's a really impressive feature set to have added in and I was very impressed. On the slightly more negative side the game is glitchier than it really should be (but has already been patched a couple of times so that's good) and despite having an unlockable theatre mode to watch clips from the game there's no passive watch the entire game without risk of game over so if you're hoping for \"Night Trap - the Movie\" you'll probably just want to wait until someone puts one on YT.\n\nStill this is absolutely the best way to play this game and I daresay it's moved from a cute idea with painful issues to a more rounded game that's actually worth your time (and a no brainer if you love B-Movies). You'll probably notice the seams here and there but it's Night Trap and it's really quite good - honest.\n\nHere's hoping we get to see Double Switch and Wirehead in the distant future.\n", "recommendationid": "34776979", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505581", "timestamp_created": 1504709680, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 488, "playtime_forever": 105, "last_played": 1504707727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987816691"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505510573, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "The game itself is brilliant, Scene of the Crime is great, but despite what Steam said in the specs when I ordered it, it requires a separate graphics card, an onboard card stutters and craps out.\n\nExteremly disappointed that Steam / Screaming Villians didn't make this clear before purchase, and that Steam didn't refund my purchase when the issue was made clear to them.\n\nRecommend the game, yes.
