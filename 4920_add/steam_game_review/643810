Here is my experience so far. I played the game with an XBOX ONE controller via USB cable.\n\nREALLY GOOD!\n- Really beautiful music when it plays.\n- Really relaxing sounds, especially the sound of waves and the wind blowing.\n- Vibrant colors painting a beautiful world.\n- Lots of fish and creatues that are fun to spot.\n- Interesting highlights making you want to see what might be there.\n- Performance. I have an an i5-2500K CPU (3.3 ghz) and a gtx 970 GPU. Everything was butter smooth all the time.\n- A joy to find new biomes.\n- Playing as different creatures are fun. Ducks are fast, but hard to control when flying slow, butterflies pretty much the opposite.\n\nCOULD BE BETTER...\n- You do not play 1st or 3rd person, but in \"bird ass\" perspective. Simply said, I feel the camera is way too close to the bird. I'd prefer the camera a bit further away. And I would absolutely ADORE first person perspective.\n- It's currently a bit hard to land and take off. I'd prefer it to be easier. Also the bird flaps lake crazy when taking off. Would prefer a more slow, but powerfull flapping.\n- You \"become\" the birds and creatures you get close to for a short time, before turning back into your start bird. It is kind of cool sometimes, other times kind of irritating. I do not find it serene to become a flying monkey all the time. A skill to target and transform into the creates you see when YOU want to would be better (my opinion).\n- No reward for exploration. I don't expect much, but certain areas/spots should give a reward when you reach them. It could some interesting creatures to observe, a special view, some music you don't otherwise get to hear, a new ability, a piece of lore, , a nice little animation or scene, a mini game, or whatever.\n- More variation in the terrain generation. When you fly fast, things seem very similar. Points of interest, like an extra special create, a castle, and such would be nice.\n- Bird walking and sound animation. Right now you just hover in silence when you move on ground.\n\nIN SORE NEED OF IMPROVEMENT\n- Bugs. I often experienced the immidate surroundings around me disappearing. I could see things in the distance, but they would disaapear when I get close.\n- Crashes. I experienced it twice now.\n- A jump button. Srsly, I really missed that while on ground.\n- An introduction to the controls. You get a 5 second overview of the controls before the screen disappears. I'd like that to stay for a bit longer. Also, there was no mention that you can control the power of flaps by the amount of pressure you apply on the shoulder buttons.\n- The camera got stuck a couple of times.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend getting this game, especially it costing next to nothing. Gameplay wise it has some way to go, and control/camera wise it could use a lot of improvement in my opinion. But seeing this is an early access game , I am in no doubt that this will all improve over time.\n\nI hope you and the developer(s) will find this review helpful. I can't wait to make this my go-to chill game after a long day of work, when it becomes a bit less frustrating to control your bird  ;)\n\nBest regards from Denmark.\n\nP.S.

I was fascinated every time i walked by. I had to play it and thank god i did :D Yesterday i bought the game, invited a few friends and together we were so stunned by the game - how it looks - how it feels like - how every bird is totally different from the other but still a unique and interesting experience. When you want your friend to try out that ultra heavy bird before it is changing to another one it is quite helpful that 2 or more Controllers can control the bird at the same time. Furthermore one can master the handling and control in about an hour i think, which makes exploring the world even more fun, and btw i can recommend listening to Bonobo(no ad xD) if you want more background-music. \nOn my machine (i5-3570k@4,5 - gtx970) the game runs pretty smooth except some minor hickups you might not even notice if you aren't looking for it, although i already had it crashing when i tabbed out while flying^^\n[h1]So is that game for you?[/h1]\nI don't know xD. You just fly around in a sort of random generated world which looks amazing in my opinion. The sound scenery is a big part in the game giving you such a great and immersive feel. In every wing slap, every bird, goat, color in the sky, or the lighting in a cave you fly bye i just notice how much love, art and hard work went into this experience. You don't always need goals or a task, because that's what this game won't give you and i like that. That's what i do in GTA all the time^^ \nI just can tell you [b]how i felt[/b] - and i felt pretty happy and relaxed tonight <3\n\nWell it is [b]Early Access[/b] so there obviously are things that can be improved and I am sure the Feature-request-list is growing fast, but I still want to mention a few things that i think are important:\n[list]\n[*]Reaching the end of the world is not the greatest thing, nevertheless that \"Great Wall\" there is an experience. I hope it will be kind of infinite in the future or more like a barricade instead of then missing textures. \n[*]Sometimes you get stuck in the wall but not a problem, you can respawn.\n[*]There already is a Bird and Map Editor - I totally did not get them yet, but i also haven't looked much into them sooo... good that they are there :) \n[*]I really want that Splitscreen  we talked about, or some sort of multiplayer possibility in the future <3 \n[*]I would like to see more options. For example independent sliders for wing sound, environment sound and music would be sick, as well as (if its possible) more concrete settings for resolution and borderless window.\n[*]And a free camera on the right stick to be able to see your bird from every perspective would be nice too :)\n[/list]\n\nWell i love that game and I am sure a lot of people are going to, too. With being able to make your own maps and animals, I am also really looking forward to see the community creating insane content.\nI believe in that game and the wonderful developers! <3 <3 <3 \n\nThank you!", "recommendationid": "35082445", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507942", "timestamp_created": 1505908588, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 372, "last_played": 1507070067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 133, "steamid": "76561198031848522"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506536242, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "This game is everything I've ever wanted since a kid, just a cute lil bird friend- that can be other various bird friends or other animal furry friends- and you have these beautiful enviroments you can fly through WITH NO FEAR OF DEATH OR ENEMIES MURDERING ME. \n\nThere's also a yeti man who I just adore.\n\nThe controls are also just a pleasure to use, and there's always a grace to the fly you control your lil bird friend (apart from when you misjudge that distance between you and that one tree)\n\nOverall, awesome game and i want to play it all the time and be a cute duck all the time.", "recommendationid": "35246834", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_created": 1506536242, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_forever": 228, "last_played": 1507051493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 228, "steamid": "76561198170861322"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505422030, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Pretty great if you don\u2019t need story or objectives to have fun.\n[spoiler]I especially enjoyed becoming a flying mountain goat.[/spoiler]", "recommendationid": "34957407", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507796", "timestamp_created": 1505422030, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_forever": 55, "last_played": 1506702491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "steamid": "76561197984013551"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505412685, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great if you just want to zone out for a while and fly around in beautifully serene landscapes.

You play as a bird like creature that morphs fluidly between colours and shapes and you explore an ever morphing world of colour and shapes. The majesty is that it doesn't try to be more than that but it so perfectly captures the feeling of instinctive flight that you just want to go forever. If you've ever played something like Minecraft and rather than engage in building you set out and just explored what the engine would generate, Fugl is that but far more visually stimulating.\n\n[u]*EARLY ACCESS NOTES*[/u]\n\nSo here's the ugly bit, the game is still very much in early access - if your computer isn't at least a bit of beast there's no chance of the game running well.

Intuitive once you have a grasp of the controls. If you have a problem with diamonds in the rough, don't buy this game just yet. Otherwise, it's definitely worth your $$, especially if you're into flying and like infinite worlds.\n\nMore detail:\n\nEpic: The terrain generation works like a treat. Smooth and fast, even when you're rocketing along at max speed (which feels like podracing XD ). With the right settings, you get a lot of fun caves and passages to fly through, and with a few minutes of practice, you can even navigate them decently.\n\nGreat: Good variety of 'bird' models and full shift/partial shift stages. Personally had some fun with the flying bear type.\n\nNeeds work: -XBox 360 Controller input was super, super twitchy.\n-Mouse input lags pretty hard.\n-Most of the birds fly really fast and barely glide, which makes it difficult to be precise in tight spots. I'd prefer if flight were less hectic and visibility a little better as a trade off. It's supposed to be meditative, after all.\n-Flapping mechanics are primitive at the moment, and landing is weird.\n-Also, the unpredictable shift mechanic is irritating sometimes. Would be better if you only changed shape on command and when targeting a viable creature/plant/whatever.\n\nSummary: It's very much an early access game, but one that (glitches, bugs and crashes aside for now) could develop from an amazing concept to something truly spectacular.

Lots of little critters to change into, however they feel a little boring and repetitive right now. \n\nThere are multiple biomes, it may not seem like it at first because you have to fly fast and far to get to them. If you press \"Y\" it returns you to a starting cliff. So far I've found a mountains/pines area and a barren deserty jungle area...there are probably more than that. \n\nEdit: avatar customization tool works for the most part! It's pretty fun, especially if you start hitting the \"random\" button lol. World editor still doesn't work.
