With all that said, it looks like all the right stuff is there in the game.  The controls are easy to get used to and there is a definite beauty found in the thought 'less is more'.  \n\nThe music is amazing and transitions from area to area.  The control is tight.  Death is a part of this game, but the balance between what you can randomly acquire on your misadventures versus what you can build up between deaths is very nice.  Because there is a balance between the two, I hesitate to call this a 'roguelike', where accomplishment is >90% the skill and randomness of a run.  With all that said, sitting down and blowing stuff up is fun!  Looking forward to more content and challenges ahead.\n\nSome improvements I'd like to see (skipping content requests and keeping everything vague to try to avoid spoilers):\n- More granular randomness:  the current level seems to be generated in sections.  Think of rooms and once you see the same room fifteen times you have figured out all its secrets.  However, you can to a great degree predict which enemies will be where and the game becomes a grind rather than engaging.  \n- More AI depth... combined arms.  So, when enemies are grouped it's really easy to blow them all up as a group.  They spawned as a group, they die as a group.  That's awesome.  In keeping with simple AI, allow units in groups to work together.  Maybe a big enemy throws a small enemy at or behind you.  Maybe a fast moving enemy picks up one or two small enemies and brings them with as a sort of earth-shattering kaboom.  Perhaps the likelihood of bots to work together increases with the amount of resources you spend between deaths or uses some other measure.  Whatever these combinations are, still keep it simple so that the learning curve doesn't become a cliff.\n\nBottom line: for an early access game, what is delivered is rather well polished and full-featured.  Everything in this review is subject to a LOT of change as the game is still in early access.", "recommendationid": "35104944", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506001654, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_forever": 1816, "last_played": 1507174982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1053, "steamid": "76561198246982672"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505803321, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Excellent little game, and although a tad on the simplistic side right now, the foundation is rock solid.

My only real issue is that some times the game falls a little on the dark side making it hard to spot enemies and pits, but this is really more of a nitpick than anything else. Bravo to Binji (the dev) on making something that has almost limitless potential for improvement and refinement.
