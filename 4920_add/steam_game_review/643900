It mixes  a  Final Fantasy Tactics-ish class/skill system and super-nintendo era graphics with a more western dungeon-crawl RPG sensibility and throws in a bit of roguelike as well.  You'll start with a party of 4 characters, expandable to 6,  and fight your way through... aw heck, won't give away the \"story\".    Anyhow, the tactical combat and character development is executed to near perfection for me; my only wish is that there was more of it.", "recommendationid": "33906225", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502191", "timestamp_created": 1501425582, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 295, "playtime_forever": 1374, "last_played": 1501534105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970320350"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503359816, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I gave this game a 6 out of 10. It has new classes, visuals, enemies and environments. It sticks to its inherent qualities from voidspire but has some quick flaws that made my decision.\n\nThe game only had 4 \"procedurally generated\" zones. The individual areas within a zone are repeatedly frequently and after just a few \"runs\", you'll get bored of it and its nearly zero reward system. The masks you collect are a cool optional thing to do, but are unnecessary (at least in my point of view of tactical rpgs) because the game still has the leveling system for class unlocks. The general purpose of it is to give the player free range to multiclass every character. I played through the 4 zones, unlocked mythril and felt overpowered for its end boss after about 6 hours.\n\nI kept playing as much as I did, because it felt like there would be some big event after you fell the main boss Avora (or it's heart actually). I thought the game would open up some new area and mythril would be come obsolete. It gave me the same pent up explorative feel of Terraria after you kill the Wall of Flesh.\n\nOverall, voidspire tactics was much better in every way. This game isn't necessarily bad, just underwelming to the point it frustrates you just to reopen it cause you think you missed something.", "recommendationid": "34405096", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500328", "timestamp_created": 1503359816, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 147, "playtime_forever": 1573, "last_played": 1503359355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197962085440"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 13, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
