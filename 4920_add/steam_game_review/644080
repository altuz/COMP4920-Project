What more could you want?  Seriously, stop being so greedy.\n\nIf you\u2019re already familiar with the game, this version is almost identical - though there are a few improvements.  Each chapter contains far more levels.  There\u2019s a new dictionary function - to help convince you that yes, the random combination of letters you desperately punched in really *is* an obscure word, honest.  And there are no time limits on using particular bears - so once you unlock game-changing legendary bears (yes you, Relativity Bear), you can keep using them as often as you like.  Keyboard control makes it much easier to enter words quickly, and when playing typed words the game will helpfully select letter tiles with fewest turns remaining.\n\nIt would be great to see the addition of many more achievements (bears unlocked, levels completed, lengths and categories of words played) - hopefully these will come with the next update.  But that\u2019s a tiny complaint, and it\u2019s definitely worth the price tag in its current form.

So, it's a faster experience.\n\nSecondly, I appreciate the addition of the dictionary for the words spelled.
