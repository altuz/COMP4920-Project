The controls are pretty simple, you use grip or trigger to move the mast to get the boat going and the direction you want and you move around the cannon and press trigger to fire from either of two cannons at your sides.  So you will need to position your ship correctly to even be able to aim on target.\n\nNice, cartoonish graphics.  Nice music.  I wish this game were two player coop option.  Or multiplayer.  But it's definitely worth $4.  Especially for us who live, breathe, and dream to sail the pirate life.\n\nRate 6/10", "recommendationid": "35014542", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1505625099, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 12, "last_played": 1505622565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
