Some interesting variations in enemy AI behavior, and some interesting environmental hazards. A sprint/roll ability adds some movement variety.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=966085428\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=966073516\nKilling enemies drops green credits that you can pick up and use between levels to improve passive buffs. You get credits even if you die on a level. And this is *not* a roguelike/roguelite, so you keep your progression through the 60 handcrafted levels.\n\nI haven't gotten far enough yet to try all the special abilities. One provides a protective shield around you. Another casts a sort of spell on surrounding enemies so that they take each other for a time. Another freezes nearby targets temporarily.\n\nSo far I prefer the Deep Waker Zero character for his bullet-hell like SMG weapon, which is so far what I have the most fun using in this. :)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=966072352\nCons? imho, it's held back a bit imho by lack of terrain variety, absence of any interesting objectives (it's clear the map and find the portal) and generally very rudimentary sound FX. Which probably is just a function of a small budget. I think the basic twin-stick gameplay -- though I'm playing on kb/mouse -- is generally spot-on. :)\n\nThis is an Early Access title, so it'll be interesting to see how it evolves.", "recommendationid": "33312110", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508803", "timestamp_created": 1499349006, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 329, "playtime_forever": 61, "last_played": 1503724426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970358346"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498833474, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 8, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fast paced top down shooter.\nPlay as a GIANT FROG who recites POETRY.\nBlast your way through swathes of SUB-Froglets and others.\nColorful neons to wash away the drab gray that has infected gaming.\nI love it!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeX5JpvOY_g&feature=youtu.be", "recommendationid": "33041273", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497614", "timestamp_created": 1498833474, "author": {"num_reviews": 396, "num_games_owned": 537, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1498825465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019816374"}, "votes_up": 10}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
