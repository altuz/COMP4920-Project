Just reuploaded to Steam. I'm assuming they took advantage of Steam Greenlight shutting down to get their game onto Steam AGAIN! \n\nIn this video, I point a lot of this stuff out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=palxzlK0MjQ\nSince this is the same game as Lex Mortis here is my Review.\nWhy is this game so bad? Sure it looks good, but what's the point when there's no good gameplay. What's the point of an open world when the enemies are scripted and don't hunt you down, and all the buildings you can't enter or do anything with intel the game lets you. That's not even the worst part of the game there's NO FLASHLIGHT REALLY WHY??? What's the point of a good looking game if you can't see anything when it's dark and when I say ''dark'' I meant pitch black and the fact that you can't turn off the very annoying music. Coupled with the  .000000000001 mph walking speed you get the most frustrating game I have ever played. 3/10 M8.", "recommendationid": "33480727", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575243", "timestamp_created": 1499869253, "author": {"num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 517, "playtime_forever": 36, "last_played": 1499776943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049800779"}, "votes_up": 48}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499769352, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 24, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "One more game on cryengine.
