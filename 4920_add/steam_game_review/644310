If you want to see some gameplay:\n[url=https://youtu.be/9u84yROP2to]Click here. You will quickly decide if it's for you or not[/url]\n\nPros:\n+Cheap\n\nCons:\n-No Volume Controls\n-Extremely buggy (one of us couldn't die)\n-Everybody looks the same (unless you are close enough to see their face, which is never)\n-It simply isn't fun\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is nothing more than a buggy multiplayer shooter that means absolutely nothing. It doesn't feel competitive, it's not funny, and it really isn't fun.\nMaybe consider getting it for a very small child to play?", "recommendationid": "35033410", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500148", "timestamp_created": 1505683210, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 340, "playtime_forever": 27, "last_played": 1503347368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198022696541"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504897389, "language": "english", "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Love this game.
