The problem I have with it is my wife and I try to play games online and every game has people who start games and are not available.  The way the game is setup, there is a overall time limit for all of your turns.  So if you make a one hour game it's one hour per persons turn and then they are forced to forfeit.  So if you have a new game with 4 people, the first player can wait one hour and not do anything and then they get forced out and the game can progress.  This happens every game - people start and are not available to play.  This isnt setup right.  The game needs to have a per turn timer of like 7 minutes tops and an overall game timer.\n\nWhen the game boots players out, it replaces them with computer players - so why not let you choose computer players for those slots to begin with if you choose?  \n\nThe game as it stands now is very broken when it comes to online play and can be fixed rather easily by the developers.  They need to patch this so it's more enjoyable for online play.  By the way I'm writing this while waiting like 45 minutes now for some person to have their turn expire.

Initially I was unsure whether it would offer enough strategic depth, and was worried that many of the positive reviews would be due to the D&D brand. However I can confirm that it's a really enjoyable, strategic, game.\n\nThe interface is really well implemented. In fact, it's one of the best board game implementations I have ever seen, with options to review the whole game, and undo your most recent move, before you lock it in.\n\nThe AI is a little on the weak side, even on the highest level. However with 4 or 5 hard AIs it still provides an interesting challenge.\n\nMultiplayer is mostly played with asynchronous games.

I had heard about the board game from a few years ago, but had never played it, so this was a great opportunity for me.\n\nLords of Waterdeep succeeds on several levels. First of all, it's a terrific use of the D&D property. The game drips with atmosphere, and after a few minutes you really feel drawn into the world of scheming and back-stage manouvering that characterises Waterdeep in the many Forgotten Realms novels it appears in. The atmosphere, tone and pacing make it a brilliant game for quietly pondering with a cup of tea or glass of wine, in the slower moments of the day, or after everyone else has gone to bed.\n\nSecond of all, it works very well as a digital board game. For me, the gold standard in this genre is Nomad Games' Talisman: Digital Edition (slightly less purely, Tin Man Games' interpretation of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is also quite brilliant). The interface, its arrangement and colour scheme, and the implementation of the cards and the game board (all with beautiful, classical D&D art) all fully convey that awesome feeling of being clustered around a table with friends, having a good time with a good game.\n\nThirdly, it simply works very, very well as a game. It's great fun, totally absorbing, and provides a rich emotional experience in the playing of it. It's the kind of game you find yourself smiling about much later, as you recall your victories and defeats. The game is very logically structured, and best of all (for busy people, parents, or those who can't always afford to sink hours of gaming into one session), it follows a strict schedule of 8 turns, which means that games rarely last longer than about 25-30 minutes. There is tons of replayability in the base game alone, as you can configure each game to your liking -- which opponents you'll be playing with, their individual intelligence, and so on. Plus, with the system of hidden 'patrons' -- the actual Lords and assorted other top-tier figures -- you never know exactly what the AI's or other players' motives will be. This is because the Quest cards come in several different categories, and the Patrons give bonus points for completing Quest types that they personally favour. \n\nIn terms of value for money, I would say that Lords of Waterdeep is worth 5 or even 10 clams over the 15-clam asking price. I know there's a lot of negativity in the forums here, but whatever happened in the past, however much truth there is in the muck-raking, this game is a solid win.", "recommendationid": "34864705", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481536", "timestamp_created": 1505057664, "author": {"num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 763, "playtime_forever": 282, "last_played": 1504475252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969722720"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505625929, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "95% complete conversion of the board game.\n\nOnly thing that's missing is the 10 minutes of setting it up and cleaning up the board after play... which I'm not missing :)\n\nFun little worker placement board game for one and all", "recommendationid": "35014737", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510206", "timestamp_created": 1505625929, "author": {"num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 691, "playtime_forever": 296, "last_played": 1505552292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972940535"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504726662, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I had played the boardgame twice with 5 players and won both times.

Of course this is actually a good mechanic so the game is not decided until the very end.

First of all, reading the other reviews readily demonstrate the lack of good online play, with players essentially making you wait for a day before they are forced to leave and you can play.  Second, the game itself is flawed.  Many times, you are stuck with a lord that gives inferior rewards (like 4 points for completing one of two quest types), and the AI gets a simple lord (Every building he buys gets him 6 reward points).  Now that may not seem like a big deal, except buying buildings is the easiest thing if you have first turn, and more often then not, those buildings give you more money or resources to get even more buildings and do more quests.  Quests themselves do rarely have their good rewards, but more often then not it is just a point reward, and no help completing more quests or buying more buildings.  Quests in and of themselves seem flawed as well.  You get to choose from a string of 4 quests, but getting a quest that has requirements you can meet, AND meet that of your lord so you can keep up with the AI, is a very rare thing.  The AI play somewhat dirty as well.  There are cards that do effects, sometimes giving you more resources, sometimes hindering another's track to finish quests, and sometimes giving you significant resources at the expense of having to give some to another player as well.  The AI will always hinder the Human player, and will always help out a fellow AI.  Meaning taking on 1 or 2 AI in an offline match is not extremely difficult if you don't end up with a cripple for a lord, but taking on 3 or 4, or even 2 higher level AI means most probable defeat.
