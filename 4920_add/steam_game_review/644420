This game builds on that formula by pushing the player forward, literally.  You willl have to fight off hordes of enemies coming at you and avoid obstacles as well.  At the start of the level, you can upgrade your ship from previous playthroughs.  \n\nAt the end of the level  you will have a boss fight.  This is a must buy if you have any interest in this genre.  And best of all, the game keeps getting better with each update.  Lots of fun shoot 'em up with the immersion only VR can bring.  Great, innovative gameplay.\n\nRating 8/10 (possibly a future 10 if dev keeps improving game)\n\n", "recommendationid": "34943116", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505369150, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 13, "last_played": 1505369783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 12, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
