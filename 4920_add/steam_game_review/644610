(look out for DLC) \n\nThe ability to add our own songs and create our own drum tracks would be nice. Extracting the drums and trying to auto-generate a track almost never works in my experience. \n\nThe only issue would be the controls. You can try to learn it the way they set it up, but I would much prefer to customize things a bit. For instance, swapping the triggers and the bumpers, or changing up the face buttons. (X for snare)\nSince it uses a standard xbox controller just fine people have mentioned you could just plug in one of the drum kits and it would work. I haven't tried this but Guitar Hero only uses 5 buttons while this uses 8 so that controller is out. Rockband uses 8, but here you have 4 cymbols and as far as I know, the game does the kick bass for you. So, unless you can re-configure the controls I doubt it would be very comfortable. \n\nBut it's a good game either way.", "recommendationid": "32641969", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519730", "timestamp_created": 1498137374, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 295, "playtime_forever": 127, "last_played": 1498506389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026053603"}, "votes_up": 9}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498703834, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This is a fun game i recomend it especially if you have no friends online and you need something to do. \n\nDeveloper if you read this these are somethings i would like to see in future updates:\n\nA platform in game that lets you make your own songs, for example say i choose Queen We Are The Champions. Now with that song i can create the beat for it and once its done i can upload it to the workshop for other people to subscribe to and play it. That would be fricken amazing i would spend lots of time creating beats for the songs i love. Another thing is a timer to see how much longer you have left.
