It's craptastically awesome. The combat mechanics are clunky as all hell but works perfectly and is fair once you got the techniques down BUT you will end up in the hospital if you play for long enough.\n\nOverall, 10/10, absolute best VR game I've played thus far, would recommend for anyone who enjoy games that are so bad they're good.", "recommendationid": "35209911", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506370618, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_forever": 539, "last_played": 1507068317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 527, "steamid": "76561198197625387"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 57, "total_positive": 45, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
