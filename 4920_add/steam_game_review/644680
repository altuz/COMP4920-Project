I still haven\u2019t played the original game, and I bought this title since in the description it says that it\u2019s a good introduction of the world of [i]Libra of the Vampire Princess[/i]. I\u2019m very interested on that game, but since it\u2019s expensive as well, I\u2019ll wait for a sale. \n\nThis title consists in two short episodes: two girls called Lycoris and Aoi who are agents of an organization called Rubina. The girls dress as nuns and they kill vampires, in order to protect innocent people. [spoiler]Aoi is kinda of an a.s.s to Lycoris sometimes, trying to prove herself by saying some disrespectful things about Lycoris\u2019 late partners.[/spoiler] Then there\u2019s a few semi romantic scenes and dialogue between them, both characters insist that they love each other, but \u201cnot like that\u201d. There\u2019s some fanservice because of it, which I liked. The ending was pretty abrupt tho, things were getting cute and it ended faster before I could even say \u201cAww\u2014\u201c. lol\n\nThe second story is very different, some sort of sci-fi mixed with an occult group trying to take over the power. A woman called Iris together with her colleagues, Aconite and Galega [spoiler](he\u2019s weird as f*ck but I liked him?? He has a fetish for Iris\u2019 legs because he thinks they\u2019re perfect but it\u2019s not like he loves her. Just\u2026 her legs. lol[/spoiler], take down these crazy guys that are part of the occult group that want people to get infected with an impure life force. Wow. [spoiler]And it ends up being something totally different.[/spoiler]\n\n5/10. The art style together with BGM and VA are pretty good, but honestly, the price tag bothers me a lot. Lycoris and Aoi\u2019s story where a good introduction to the original game (at least you get to know a bit of the plot), and Iris route was basically for fanservice. Which is fine, but just\u2026 If you haven\u2019t played the original game yet, how can this second story be considered a \u201cgood introduction to the original\u201d? Even so, it was fun. The ending was unexpected at least. Overall, I recommend to get this title AFTER you read Libra of the Vampire Princess, and only if you liked the story a lot in order to pay an absurd amount of money on two short kinetic novels. You can always wait for a good sale too, it\u2019s up to you.\n\n[b]\u00b9 There\u2019s an achievement that requires 10 hours of gameplay. So I let it idle in order to get it. I finished the whole game in 2 hours or less.[/b]", "recommendationid": "33809546", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589395", "timestamp_created": 1501078781, "author": {"num_reviews": 385, "num_games_owned": 791, "playtime_forever": 615, "last_played": 1501062300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120348301"}, "votes_up": 45}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500316689, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 10, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've only played a little bit, but I'm enjoying this game.", "recommendationid": "33613775", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469998", "timestamp_created": 1500316689, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 34, "playtime_forever": 54, "last_played": 1500342790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198118036809"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
