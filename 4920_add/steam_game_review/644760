But please know what you're getting before you buy.  This game is solely shooting a basketball through a hoop in 3 different VR environments with in-game music.  You can only customize the color of your basketball.\n\nThe hoop is not perfect either.  It looks too big to be honest.  Of course that makes it easier to actually make a basket.  The hoop looks exactly the same in all 3 VR enviroments and has no net.  The hoop does keep track of how many baskets you made.  \n\nThe throwing motion is not realistic (of course how can it be without any weight to the basketball?).  But you do have to move your hand faster the farther away you are from the basket.  It's very challenging to make a 3 point shot.  If you're straight on, the backboard behaves realistically, but if you're at an angle, it does not.  The rim also seems to very hard as it bounces many balls right off so there's no \"shooter's touch\" in this simulation.  You cannot dribble (well you can shoot down and grab then shoot down and rapidly grab again but that isn't really dribbling).  You move by teleporting only.\n\n2 of the 3 VR environments are actually interesting.  And the music is pretty good if you're into urban instrumental.  The dev promises future updates, we shall see.\n\nRating as is: 6/10 sadly this is better than NBA2K VR", "recommendationid": "34895641", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511731", "timestamp_created": 1505195249, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 23, "last_played": 1506555965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505581620, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "needs work... the ball is grabbed differently each time you pick it up causing it to be thrown differently. too difficult to realize when to let go of the trigger and it just doesnt feel like it represents basketball in any way.", "recommendationid": "35002216", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502345", "timestamp_created": 1505581620, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 13, "last_played": 1505581402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198308736470"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
