The idea is simple and the gameplay is just as simple. A great game for relaxation. \n\nIf you have played the previous Zup! games, you know the deal. This time the new mechanic is the portals (which I feel were often underused: they were more as an extension of the course, not a part of the solution). However, it's oddly meditative to watch stuff go through them. \n\nThe negatives I talked about? \n1. When you have to wait for achievement pop-ups to stop before you can solve a level, there are *WAY* too many achievements. Or bad level design. \n2. The game takes about 30 minute to complete: way too little content! \n3. The music seems to be really short and loops probably hundreds of times in the 30 minutes. \n4. Most puzzles are ridiculously easy -- so easy in fact that you *cannot* offer any other solution than the correct one.\n\nAll in all, if you've played one Zup! you've seen it all. This installment is probably the weakest one, so I'd recommend you rather try 1 or Zero if you only want one. For those who find this kind of easy clicking addictive and relaxing, a must buy. The simple and clean look is still captivating.", "recommendationid": "34794463", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503554", "timestamp_created": 1504791148, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 638, "playtime_forever": 54, "last_played": 1504789833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198113603916"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506879441, "language": "english", "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "fun", "recommendationid": "35390666", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500178", "timestamp_created": 1506879441, "author": {"num_reviews": 84, "num_games_owned": 148, "playtime_forever": 1263, "last_played": 1507171664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 261, "steamid": "76561198300298245"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504905963, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "[h1] Zup! 5\t[/h1]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n+ Lots Of Achievements & Easy Perfect Game\n+ Cheap\n+ Trading Cards\n+ Fun & Easy\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n- Not For Real Hardcore Puzzle Gamers\n\n[b] Review [/b]\nZup! 5 is just like the other Zup! games. Explode the right things at the right times to go on to the next level. The reason why I give the Zup! games a good review even though it's mostly just for achievements is that there are some games that have alot of achievements that has zero content and are not even enjoyable, but the Zup! games do have some content and I find them very enjoyable to play. If you want a nice little puzzle game to play that has a ton of achievements for cheap than this game is for you, but if you are looking for a hardcore puzzle game that makes you think alot than I suggest looking at another game. I would recommend this game to achievement hunters.\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win. \n\nIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.
