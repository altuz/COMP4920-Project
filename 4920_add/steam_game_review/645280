It has terrible VR implementation, the locomotion is legitimately awful (it's extremely easy to teleport into walls, and the worldspace CONSTANTLY rotates when teleporting), and the puzzles themselves are essentially just raw, uninteresting tedium consisting exclusively of memorizing a pattern and reproducing it further away.\n\nThose puzzles are in fact so easy to get that I accidentally brute-forced several of them just by pressing random buttons while initially figuring out how the puzzles worked, which felt like accidental sequence breaking. Most of the challenge if you could call it that comes from memorizng abstract shapes and having to remember them while awkwardly waddling across the level to a distant room.\n\nPut simply, this is not a good game. It's baby's first VR development, it's way overpriced, and while I cannot really prove this as of now, it feels like the whole thing is made of store-bought assets, given that the game is only somewhat artistically cohesive and the level itself feels like a jumbled mess of various assets hastily thrown together.\n\nVery much like most VR content on Steam, this should be a free game in itch.io. It's too short and too badly designed to deserve to be on the storefront, especially with how the assets seem to mostly just be bought premade.", "recommendationid": "33809999", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511613", "timestamp_created": 1501080102, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 584, "playtime_forever": 12, "last_played": 1501079440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980756641"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502590770, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I love the Great Visuals!  I also love that it's a safe environment for the little ones to explore (after I've unlocked the puzzles for them) or for me to show off VR to non-gamer friends!  I also like that there's so many directions you can go, which allows for more exploring.  Other than walking around, taking in the stunning artistry, and solving the occasional puzzle, there's nothing else to the game.\n\nI'm not going to lie, the puzzles were not always easy as some others have said.  I'm a non-traditional gamer in that I don't have time to game all the time so they weren't always intuitive for me and I \"solved\" quite a bit of them just by dumb luck/trial and error. \n\nIt would be awesome if you could make the next version that allows you to collect stuff, or mine for jewels, or interact with cute little creatures (like Gnomes & Goblins), or if there was a kid version that made the puzzles SO EASY that they were fail-safe for a 3 yr old, that would be awesome.\n\nOverall, great work, Devs!!  I'm happy to have purchased this game from you and if you ever have DLC, I'll buy that, too!
