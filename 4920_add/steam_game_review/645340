But this VR experience is definitely better than all the negative reviews would leave you to believe.  Are there better VR environments out there?  Sure, the BluVR set the standard in 360 VR experience (of course, movement is very limited in that \"game.\")  Perfect VR is probably one of the better VR meditation geared apps.\n\nHowever, this game is only .99 cents currently or $1.99 at regular price.  Is the game worth that much?  Yes.  The VR enviroments are actually more than adequate to enjoy and relax.  The only VR environment that I found needed more work was the Sahara desert mirage / pond environment.  All the other ones had really nice environments you could teleport around and enjoy.   They all had little details that made the experience worthwhile.  For example, the swing set where you can touch and move the swings.  Do I wish I could sit in the swing and go down the slides?  Yes, of course.  But then it would probably not be a relaxing walk VR game.  It would be a playground VR game.  \n\nThe game does its own sounds.  However, you can open up the YouTube browser and listen to the music that you want to listen to while you enjoy the VR surroundings.  I don't think you can ask for more for $2.  Better than watching Youtube on your PC or laptop or mobile.  \n\nRate 6/10 given the price.", "recommendationid": "34895818", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504677", "timestamp_created": 1505196424, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 12, "last_played": 1505190707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505285270, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I dont like to down vote any games unless I realy have to, but even for a $1 this is really really dull. You load into a scene of your choice but they instantly fill you with boredom. Nothing to help you relax or anything to do. Destinations blows this clean out the water. Happy to have paid a $1 to help support the developers expand the vr community though.
