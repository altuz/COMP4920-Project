But I didn't hate it either. It had enough in it to keep me occupied...and because I'm not exactly the smartest nor the best of gamers: it probably took me longer than it should have. Some of the goals/puzzles were a tad vague (IMO) and left me scratching my head, but like I said--not the sharpest tack n the box here. Hooray for me that I managed to figure everything out. \n\nTearstone is a hidden object game. It has a story that takes you on a quest to various locations where you have to find objects, talk to characters, complete goals, etc, etc... in order to fulfill your sacred destiny and make everything right with the world. The story is pretty simple. However, at times the puzzles can be frustrating. There are no clear instructions on some of them, which left me clicking on random things like an idiot 'til the solution just sort of fell into place. \n\nThis is a nice, casual game. I honestly picture this more on something like a mobile phone or tablet, but I still enjoyed playing it.", "recommendationid": "33623635", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506394", "timestamp_created": 1500358796, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 639, "last_played": 1500356882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160566444"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
