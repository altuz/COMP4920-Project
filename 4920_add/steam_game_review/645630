My knowledge of cars and engines is reaching as far as \"I know what a BMW looks like\" , my knowledge of racing cars is \"I am a huge Max Verstappen and RBR fan\" So my review is in that light. If you are someone that knows cars this review migt not be for you.\n\nMy start in this game was a bit like I had with No Man's Sky. I discovered it by accident on release day due to a twitch stream, liked what I saw and shortly thereafter bought the game not knowing about any hype, prmises or whatever. So based on that fact........ This is one of the most relaxing games in my library. I have loads of fun dismanteling and rebuilding scrap cars. I have 2 profiles, one for \"story mode\" (blue missions following some sort of story line) and one for mod cars\n\nMod cars... oh boy how quickly have they appeared. Porsche, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Abbarth, Mini heck even a McLaren and a Ford GT40 and a couple of Mustangs... all are already available in the modding forum and eas to install and use. Some awesome work has been done by a group of about 5 modders so far and the quality is fairly high. Visually stunning but sometimes a few little bugs are present... which they fix quickly I might add. Those modders are on top of things\n\nAs for Red Dot, they are working and working hard. Since release most bugs have been ironed out, a new track has been added as well as a Salon (to buy new cars, not sure why you want to do that but when modders couldn't add their parts to the shop it was the only way to obtain bodyparts for their cars)\n\nSome functions are currently still missing. the Dyno shop (don't ask me, no idea what that is) and Steam Workshop are in the pipeline, same goes for photomode. Judging by how often Red Dog gives us patches... that won't take moths, maybe a few weeks tops.\n\nMusic, I forgot almost about the radio. As far as I can see in the credits, all the music is royalty free. That would mean that youtubers can use the ingame music without issue and there are some really good songs in there (addinng to the \"relaxed\" feel of the game.\n\nIf you are a bit like me and like simulattor games, don't want all kind of management and just want to create nice things without having to go to M.I.T I can recommend this game. If you want action and suspence and fast great driving and such... might I suggest Dirt Rally? \n\ndespite the bugs that are still there and the missing features... 8/10 ... depending on how these are fixed/implemented this grade can either rise or drop", "recommendationid": "34891619", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604247", "timestamp_created": 1505170506, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 143, "playtime_forever": 10525, "last_played": 1506999445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1382, "steamid": "76561198025661408"}, "votes_up": 72}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505560279, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 4, "review": "Pros:\n\n+ Very detailed and realistic, id say its about 60-70% accurate in comparison to reality.

It would be better if all parts you needed automatically adds into list then you just simply go to shop when you're finished removing all bad parts, but maybe thats part of the challenge. \n\n- Takes a long time to finally get your paintshop, and all good skill-tree upgrades. Currently level 27 after around 30 hours of gameplay, need level 30 for paintshop. But this also is a good think because it would get boring way too fast like in CMS 15. And that brings me to my other con, which is that the game gets boring after you've done everything you can, but that is also part of Single-Player games. Maybe a future DLC coming with something interesting? \n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely, its a must have for every car enthusiast and car mechanic out there.

Far more playable than I'd thought, especially if you read some of the reviews.\n\nFirstly, I got this because I had a game called street rod back in the day. and this is easily a successor to it if they add a couple of features. Like racing for pink slips. And an auto parts trader. but everything else is superb.\n\nOk firstly, niggles. The navigation inside a repair mode is a little weird and sometimes decides to move you somewhere you dont want to be or dont expect, but you get used to it.\n\nUgh, that tutorial.  found online when trying to figure out how to get out of it ( was fine, just i didnt want to spend a whole bunch of time in a mode that would ultimately expire and i'd be at square 1) - Apparently you can skip it to start, OR, chuck some oil in the car that looks modernish, click the garage door, click the test track, click the modern looking car you just filled with oil ( remove oil cap on rocker cover, then click and hold mouse button down till the bottle drops back) and then drive through all of the waypoints and stop on the waypoint that has the stop sign under it. Tutorial over.\n\nSometimes, you are in a mode ( theres in engine bay and underneath it when you are changing mechanical parts) and it claims you need to be in that mode to interact with the part. exiting and re-entering fixes this. happens very rarely.\n\nRepairing parts isnt as intuitive with the outcome noise as it could be, and sometimes the skill tree looks like it doesnt let you get something just to spite you, but in a level or sometimes 2 it allows it. this is not a greyed out option, its otherwise normal and unobtained looking, waiting for you to spend a point.\n\nBut,\nOther than that the game is just fantastic. the attention to detail is great, the workshop environment has been faithfully re-created by at least someone who has done stuff in a workshop before or is passionate about it. Be prepared to spend hours stripping down cars and finding issues, testing cars so you dont have to strip everything down, and ripping off customers with your kept but near death parts that they dont check. Its like a dodgy car mechanic simulator. its hilarious.\nNeat parody radio stations are available on it, and the DLC actually has licensed parts for 4 cars total. \n\nfull disclaimer, I dont know (well, didnt know) one of a car from the other before playing this, so I cant vouch for the absolute accuracy on parts, infact some look like they'd normally have more bolts, but my dad who has stripped many a car in his day was floored at how much they do actually cover. So take that at face value.\n\nAlso to the devleoper : Add pink slip racing and a local paper with spare parts for sale.
