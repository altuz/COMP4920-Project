I'm not sure why but I'm really hooked on collecting fish... sorry, bad pun. Just inspired by all the puns in this game. \n\nOverall really good, the art style is amazing, it's addictive and there is a ton of content. Would love to be able to travel to more islands, but then again I haven't unlocked everything yet so maybe there are a lot more islands.", "recommendationid": "34806412", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1504837162, "author": {"num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 22, "last_played": 1504824896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025003435"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506201282, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game is great fun! There's a wealth of humour and hidden depth here. The salty nautical puns and playful humour complement a truly charming world populated with a cast of endearing characters. The fishing itself strikes a great balance between being instantly intuitive and addictive whilst providing a longer challenge to master with progress. \n\nI've found myself playing both when I have a few spare minutes or for longer spells when I want to have a crack at a comical quest or challenge pirates to a duel! Highly recommended, this one put a big goofy grin on my face!", "recommendationid": "35164058", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506201282, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_forever": 774, "last_played": 1506199711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 774, "steamid": "76561198035377954"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
