Match-3 is the wrong tag. It looks cute, it is fun for 30 minutes and then it stops. Because by that time you unlocked all monsters except a giant bossdragon,  you figured out how to oneshot everything, you upgraded to an overpowered state, you have heard both of the battlemusic tracks 250 times (both), and at this stage, it's a clicker, a task.\n\nI would recommend the sequel, as soon as it gets one. This game however is a great basic work to build up upon, to expand and to diversify the gameplay, so that it can be fun for a lot longer than 30 minutes.\n\nFollow me as a curator at http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28337205-Fair-Minded-Witness/?appid=298050", "recommendationid": "34244717", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524783", "timestamp_created": 1502749502, "author": {"num_reviews": 67, "num_games_owned": 480, "playtime_forever": 68, "last_played": 1502748913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980796094"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500369687, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Heroic Dungeon is an addictive puzzle game with nice artstyle combination between minesweeper and a \"3 in a row\" connect game. The minesweeper part is that you click tiles on a playing field and under them there is extra health, extra damage and other goodies or a monster. (or the key that lets you progress to the next playing field). If you clear out all the tiles you also get to spin the wheel for more goodies of the kind you can find on the playing field/in the chests.\nAnother thing is that you can not click the tiles next to a monster without killing it and it can block more than one tile.\nThe connect game is very much like Ironcast so you do not get the bombastic chain reaction style of a connect game, there also appears some things that'll make you take all the monster heads in a square pattern across the board. (plus some other variants). You need to connect enough of them to be able to attack and the first round in a battle has you connecting twice so you're fairly likely to get the first attack in a game, the monsters you fight only attacks with their attack value.\n\nMusic's fairly bombastic in the battle sequence and prob. very suited for the inbetweens as well as I never really thought about it. (which generally is a good thing).It's a great timekiller. First few levels are really simple but then game begins to be more challenging. It's a really nice little game to play during a teabreak, I had fun playing it, so I definitely give it a thumbs up!
