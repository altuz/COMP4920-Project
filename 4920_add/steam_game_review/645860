In General, a good study of the world, high quality art, design, effects. For virtual reality this is of great importance. The gameplay I would advise you to diversify. The game lacks more interesting enemies, with different attack types and behavior. Look at hardcore games, like Dark Souls, where almost every enemy the player has to look for his tactics. Don't be afraid to EXPERIMENT and add the most unexpected solutions, and not go on about the standard solutions. In General, use all your imagination to surprise the player. It could even be unrealistic or almost fantastic. It doesn't matter. The main thing that it was unusual and memorable. \nMore different enemies, weapons, locations, more new experiences!", "recommendationid": "34500803", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488204", "timestamp_created": 1503740812, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_forever": 53, "last_played": 1503737601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032404373"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503704579, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 26, "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Great!!!
