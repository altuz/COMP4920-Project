Its true the aiming is bad, because your character is an ULTRA NOOB.  Get a few levels, upgrade your weapons and get some accuracy implants, and the aiming is good.  Its bad at first intentionally :D.\n\n9/10 so far I will update my opinion once I've played it longer.\n\n\nALSO, I giant thank you for allowing us to just move via the touch pad.  I don't mine teleport as an option, as sometimes it is fun to use in combat, but there are way too many games that wont let you move forward with the touchpad... bravo it works well in this game.", "recommendationid": "35216679", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531535", "timestamp_created": 1506406592, "author": {"num_reviews": 96, "num_games_owned": 380, "playtime_forever": 87, "last_played": 1506406486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "steamid": "76561198058602281"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504603464, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Dead Effect 2 VR is a violent space shooter\nAlong with the better VR games like Arizona Sunshine or Syren this game is quality stuff\n$19.99 is a Good Price (I would have paid $39.99 or more for this game)\n+ Excellent VR Graphics\n+ Huge Choice of Deadly Weapons (Get a fistful of steel)\n+ Levels Design is Awesome\n+ Feeling of VR immersion on this game can be intense at times\n+ Movement is now done through the thumbsticks on Oculus\n    (Which is way better than the point and click to move games where you \"Teleport\")\n- Optimization needs a little tweeking\n- Aiming sometimes is difficult \n    (Since there is no reticle or aiming dot you must use your VR skills to get a clean shot)\n\nOVERALL <<9.1 out of 10 Stars>>\n\nAnd YES there is plenty of blood and Gore....", "recommendationid": "34752690", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507259", "timestamp_created": 1504603033, "author": {"num_reviews": 54, "num_games_owned": 201, "playtime_forever": 273, "last_played": 1505299411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198008149534"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504660668, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "this is a 10 out of 10 game for v r every aspect has been thought out extremly well, being able to see your arms and the various weaponry on your body for quick access , brilliant excellent keep it up", "recommendationid": "34767557", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "timestamp_created": 1504660668, "author": {"num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_forever": 1093, "last_played": 1506571486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "steamid": "76561198089479274"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506347672, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Very strong start! The game has a ton of potential and is already really fun. As an early access game, it is still a little rough around the edges but it is further along than most EA games when first put on the store. Voice acting is mostly terrible, but if you are willing to embrace the cheesy B-movie feel of the game then this won't be an issue. \n\nAt this point, it is already easy to recommend, and it looks highly likely that after a few months of polish this could make the VR top ten must-haves. Especially for those looking for something with a little more depth or sick of wave-based shooters. The RPG elements are great and each of the 3 characters has a very different feel to the play style. VR has far too many bite sized games, underdeveloped games and wave shooters, Dead Effect 2 VR is a nice addition to the list of games with more depth.
