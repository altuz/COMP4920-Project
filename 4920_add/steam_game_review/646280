The AI is ok if you're playing by yourself and the levels are interesting.\n\nIn my opinion the best level is the Museum (Because of the smashable Glass).\n\nIn my opinion the game is worth it, but only at around 50% off. At full price the game doesn't justify its cost. The game is fun though.

If this was $.99 then I'd be fine with it.\n\nThe gameplay is literally as simple as move, aim, throw stuff.  There is nothing else.  The aiming controls with the right pad (we used two steam controllers and a third USB PC controller) is very wonky.\n\nI have friends to play this with... we did... we all agree it's not worth the money.\n\nExpect to play this game for MAYBE 10 minutes before it gets old.  My friends and I made it about 5 minutes.\n\nI take rating games poorly very seriously, but sadly this one deserves a solid thumbs down.", "recommendationid": "34116968", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485714", "timestamp_created": 1502249385, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 191, "playtime_forever": 8, "last_played": 1502223209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972349832"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
