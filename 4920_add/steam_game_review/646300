Very rarely do i do that but this game blew me away. \n\nI love Horror games, I love being scared and i love seeing Developers that think outside the Box. \nThis game ticks all those boxes. \nI idea is simple survive, get off the island and possibly find your friends. \nbut with no weapons your hands in chains, Puzzles to solve and the island over run with Zombies its no that simple. \nThe game uses directional sound very well to give you the feeling that something is always behind you ready to pounce. \nI have to admit i jumped on more than one occasion because i knocked a box over that i didnt see  or a Zombie came running at me. \n\nI have made it so far to episode 2 and the devs have said there is about 2-3 hours play in this game but more to come at a later date and a coop mode as well. \n\nIf you are reading this to decide to buy the game or not i say purchase it, give it a go just make sure you have clean underwear handy. \n\nThis is currently battling for top spot as my favorite Horror game. I think when i get to play it again it will cement its place as number 1 \n", "recommendationid": "34364890", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519180", "timestamp_created": 1503201834, "author": {"num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 109, "playtime_forever": 56, "last_played": 1502898610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198287419912"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503376345, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "pretty scary just waiting for the multiplayer update and hoping for more updates in the future i wish the walking was a tad bit better it just feels real stiff at the moment but still recommend", "recommendationid": "34408362", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1503376345, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1504391952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197977268135"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503857987, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "It's ok ish I suppose, worth \u00a35-\u00a38 tops maybe, not worth anything like the asking price, just a bit naff really.
