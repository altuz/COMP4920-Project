The rest is just her talking in her kitchen. The skydiving could have been cool but there was no build up (you're just thrown from the plane immediately), the ground textures look pretty terrible and just give off a \"this is so fake\" feeling (despite the rest of the game looking pretty decent) and then it fades back to the kitchen before the chute even gets pulled. \n\nIt's also kind of silly that they specify \"skydiving in Switzerland\" and \"spending time on the beach in Spain\" when there are no landmarks or scenery or anything in either daydream. The beach is devoid of anything but sand and water and you never get close enough to the ground during the skydiving to make anything out. She talks about windmills in Switzerland (which are featured on the main menu) so it would have been interesting to pull the chute and land in a field of windmills or something. It's a daydream. Go nuts.\n\nMeh, there's nothing really special here but it's also only $5 so I'm not going to give it a negative rec.

The girl is really sweet but the conversation is pretty 'weird' and a touch dull. There are also heaps of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in the subtitles. \n\nBut on the flipside. This has to be the BEST BEST BEST animated VR character I have ever seen. I would say it is very close to perfect from not only an animation and modelling point of view but I love the way her eyes track you when you move and little details like that it really sells the experience. The house decor also looks really nice.\n\nOh and the real reason we all bought this was the skydive and beach scene. Those are great too.
