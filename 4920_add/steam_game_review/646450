Not worth it.\n\nI have to say that I legit tried to play.  Not good, but not appalling for the first 11 levels then on level 12 you can't beat it without exploiting physics glitches which I tried about 200 times until I gave up and went back to the main menu.  Permanently can't get back to level 12 to complete it... ever apparently.\n\nThat and a billion achievements all called NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_NAME_11 pop up endlessly.  I don't know why this game exists but it is not because it is worth playing.  I will be reporting this game because it is one of those things that Valve would call a \"game-like object\" that is not here to provide a good experience for players.", "recommendationid": "34907216", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504713", "timestamp_created": 1505244804, "author": {"num_reviews": 138, "num_games_owned": 266, "playtime_forever": 583, "last_played": 1505307104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970938346"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506793269, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "5000 nice and cool Achievements \nYou can use them on your achievement showcase.\nIf you need some achievement for your profile like me\n\nand There is some problem inside some lvls (like lvl 13)\n\nP.n: bought with a coupon of 75%", "recommendationid": "35220738", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501293", "timestamp_created": 1506428236, "author": {"num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_forever": 98, "last_played": 1506530481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 98, "steamid": "76561198374403841"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Negative", "total_negative": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 38, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 4}, "success": 1}
