JetDogs has the time management formula down to perfection, and as long as the tuning remains tight yet forgiving while allowing for flexible strategies and featuring top notch presentation, I will always gobble these games up as fast as they can make them.\n\nOnce again, you're tasked with completing a set of goals in order to proceed to the next level. While the goals vary, the general concept is the same; collect resources and perform specific tasks before the timer expires. Efficiently managing your workers is at the heart of the gameplay, although it's by no means necessary if you want to play more casually (and there are 3 different difficulty modes to fit a variety of players' tastes), but doing so adds strategic depth to what is in essence a very simple game. The more effort you put into challenging yourself, the more reward you'll get for it.\n\nThere are a couple mechanics that are unique to this series.  Bandits will leave timed bombs on paths which need to be defused before they blow leaving a gaping hole in their wake which takes quite a bit of resources to repair.  Not being prepared for these can mean the difference between snagging 2 and 3 stars.  You can also repair and upgrade buildings that give a steady income of resources without the need to gather.  Juggling these buildings with how quickly you can gather your own resources from replenishable nodes adds flexibility to the gameplay, and I'm always for more strategic options in these games.\n\nThe presentation is great with simple yet pleasing cartoon graphics, quality acting by Alica's VA, and another great soundtrack.  There are also story snippets in the beginning of each level which give a short description of what's going on.  Sometimes a bit of dialogue is exchanged between Alicia and her workers or the enemies too, which makes the characters feel a bit more dynamic. The only complaint I have is a few typos here and there, and a handful of story snippets that don't completely fit into the description window and cut off part of the last sentence.  I didn't find this to be a deal breaker as the gameplay more than makes up for it, but others may be more annoyed by it than myself. \n\nIf you're a fan of time/resource management games, there's no reason not to buy this game.  The value for your money is phenomenal, even at full price.  I certainly hope further entries in Alicia Quatermain's series makes it over to Steam.  These titles would make excellent additions to my time management game library.", "recommendationid": "35225152", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610973", "timestamp_created": 1506443061, "author": {"num_reviews": 67, "num_games_owned": 2214, "playtime_forever": 481, "last_played": 1506565839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 291, "steamid": "76561197999732661"}, "votes_up": 56}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504640363, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "If you liked the 12 Labours of Hercules, you'll like this.
