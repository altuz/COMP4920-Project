With difficulty increasing, you'll get ghost enemies, levers, holes and time limits too.. it can get really challenging!\nIt's like Cut the Rope, or all those Flash titles, but anyways reviewing this here and not considering Flash or mobile games it's worth a dollar :) Super recommended!!", "recommendationid": "35064095", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500361", "timestamp_created": 1505826672, "author": {"num_reviews": 115, "num_games_owned": 225, "playtime_forever": 62, "last_played": 1505828899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198356141989"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506160233, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Simple, easy and fun.
