For an early access game, it is surprisingly very good and very well put together. There are little to no bugs. \"Goodbye My King\" has nice graphics, good gameplay, awesome levels, and I could play this for hours upon hours. Keep up the good work CivilSavages! I can't wait to see what you have in store for the future of \"Goodbye My King\". I think it's worth the $7.00 and I really recommend to anyone who enjoys playing stealth games or a fan of \"Hello Neighbor\". I rate this game 9.5/10!", "recommendationid": "33563712", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500461", "timestamp_created": 1500137203, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 146, "last_played": 1501899610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198135400689"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502794099, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Would probably wrtie a review if the game didn't crash while loading the first level", "recommendationid": "34253547", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495050", "timestamp_created": 1502794099, "author": {"num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 146, "playtime_forever": 32, "last_played": 1506171328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "steamid": "76561197998348817"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 19, "total_positive": 14, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
