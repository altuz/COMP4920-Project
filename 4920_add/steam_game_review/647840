Totem Games tends to cringe when people call the game a wargame. Developers likes to think of this game as more of a simulation title rather than a wargame. In some respects they is right.\n\nAs a game though this is a very good one, one that anyone interested in naval warfare should look at. In fact, this game would make an excellent follow on for that title.\n\nThe game is not a fast paced game. Yes, you can speed up the time in the game, in fact, you will have to if you want to play the game at all, but even so this is a slow paced game and the action fulfils itself over time. If you want a quick bang bang style game then this isn\u2019t it. The ships of the time were notoriously inaccurate in their firing and in this game it is evident. You will fire dozens of shots at an enemy ship before you will finally sink it. Yes, there may be a lucky shot but don\u2019t count on it.\n\nIf you are even remotely interested in naval warfare from the age of steam then this is a very good game to check out. The game isn\u2019t perfect, the interface can be frustrating to newbies but the game is fun, and engrossing.\n\nIn the end I recommend the game.", "recommendationid": "34751779", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511455", "timestamp_created": 1504598231, "author": {"num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 152, "playtime_forever": 286, "last_played": 1504535093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007111818"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
