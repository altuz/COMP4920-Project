In terms of replayability, it mainly divulges into two distinct paths, pacifistic or bloodthirsty. The main theme that the story revolves over is contact with a spacefaring species and the ending practically allows you to decide what happens: humanity wins, the aliens win, or an uneasy but prolonged peace is found. Uniquely, CotSC actually has no romantic aspect of its relationships. The most important character interaction you'll make, however, is with your ships AI, Lloyd. So, the breakdown, considering the price, length of the story, it's quality and characters, all based on my opinions:\n\nGrammar and Vocabulary: 5/5 - mostly due to having no noticeable errors\nStory: 4/5 - considering the price, I think it's modestly long enough and it does explore human nature mixed with the concept of contact with another intelligent species though the length restricts it from going to deep our exploring other ideas like Human-AI interaction.\nCharacters: 3/5 - characters remain static due to the length of the plot but interactions with Salazar, Nagoop and Lloyd remain probably the most central of the interactions while Lloyd's interaction with you serve to be the only thing to grow (or shrink) in terms of how you react to his less than polite banter.\nReplayability 3/5 - not too bad, not too good; for its length, you can probably squeeze three-fourths of a day from the choices and endings.\n\nOverall Score: Meh", "recommendationid": "32501525", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538324", "timestamp_created": 1497698955, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 111, "playtime_forever": 272, "last_played": 1497698221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013029061"}, "votes_up": 21}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
