Allying/betraying the pirates, getting to know the crew, inscrutable aliens, and building up a powerbase: all good.\n\nBut, several times throughout the book, you'll be asked a brainteaser.  E.g. one of those \"what number comes next in this series\" questions.  And then you, personally, have to figure it out and answer.  It doesn't matter that your character's a world-class hacker whose brain could run circles around anyone else on board, you have to do these problems yourself (or, for some of them, use google).\n\nThese segments are mostly toward the beginning and end, but every time they come up it completely kills the momentum of the story.  It pulled me out of the \"enjoying the experience\" groove and into \"oh goody math homework\".  And toward the end you'll be enduring four or five in a row as the aliens seek to test your knowledge (and again, not that of your character's).\n\nIn short, it's a decent book made worse by some very jarring distractions.", "recommendationid": "34126627", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511502", "timestamp_created": 1502290557, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1856, "playtime_forever": 135, "last_played": 1502255676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984628483"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
