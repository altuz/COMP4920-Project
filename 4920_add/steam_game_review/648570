The game just falls short of being worth the money spent.\n\nHell Dimension VR is a \"wave shooter\" with a horror theme that might cause the more jittery folks to get a few good screams out of it, but didn't really make my pulse pound. There's a decent variety of creatures, each with their own attack patterns and \"weaknesses\", that come at you from random points in all directions. Each level has up to 10 waves of monsters, and as you survive the waves you earn points to buy better weapons and heal yourself. Each round you have to re-buy everything as weapons don't carry over from the previous round, meaning that you need to time your purchases right in order to be able to afford enough to survive the higher level waves. The game has only a handful of levels, but boasts a \"challenge\" mode to make up for its lackluster storyline.\n\nThere are several large bugs in the game which can be annoying, but nothing game-breaking that makes you want to quit playing forever.\n\nPros\n- Nice graphics\n- Interesting variety of monsters\n- The purchase system lets you customize your playstyle, which would be great in multiplayer if there were ever any games to play\n- Cleavage I guess?\n\nCons\n- Lacks polish in many areas: dialogue, monster AI, companion AI(!), weapon balance etc\n- Story is a joke\n- Difficulty is all over the place\n- Have to \"re buy\" guns you already own, making expensive guns almost useless except for on the final waves\n- Melee weapons are brokenly powerful, allowing you to completely clear all enemies within reach just by flailing your arm wildly\n- AI companion is completely useless as anything other than a meat shield\n- Currently it's impossible to get into a multiplayer match as there's no player base, and no direct IP connection or obvious hosting capability\n- Can't pause, can't set options from within game\n- Monsters make almost no sound on approach (even the massive ones!), making it very hard to tell where you need to be shooting at\n\nBasically, as mentioned, the game lacks polish. The storyline has no dialogue except for in the tutorial, random levels are marked as \"cleared\" before you've even played them, the AI companion is a huge waste of money, and the game throws so many monsters at you at once that only certain weapon combinations even have a chance of allowing you to survive. Also the multiplayer option only lets you select \"Join game\" and so far I've yet to actually manage to find any online games.\n\nThe weapon purchase system is good, except the differences between many of the weapons is mostly just price, and the really fun weapons are locked away behind enormous price tags. Not to mention that you have to buy the same weapons all over again each wave - even the weakest ones! As mentioned, the weapons are unbalanced too - you can clear a dozen swarming enemies with one baseball bat and a furious masturbation motion, while your handgun runs out of ammo before you even take down a single foe half the time. \n\nAt the end of each wave, you get graded and then awarded virtually nothing in terms of currency to buy weapons. It seems to be mostly based on the enemies you faced, so overspending early is a good way to lose later on by virtue of not being able to afford decent stuff. At the same time, if you try to win every wave with dual handguns you'll game over faster than you can say \"monster swarm\". So it's kind of a catch 22.\n\nAnd then there are the bugs. When enemies get close they are incredibly hard to hit with a gun. Shooting them at point blank range sometimes causes bullets to go right through them instead of hitting them and all the while they're chipping away at your HP. I had one game where all of the enemies suddenly vanished, and my AI companion continued shooting at a wall for 5 minutes straight until I got bored and quit. I couldn't restart (no pause menu) so I had to quit the game and do that entire level over again. I was on wave 10! Also, handling the two-handed guns isn't as easy as it sounds. At times, it won't register your hand placement and you'll be shooting the gun one-handed (or unable to shoot) because it doesn't register that you've done the hand thing to enable two-hand weapon use.\n\nSo in short, the game is kinda fun and has charm, but also really needed that extra week or two of development and TLC where they ironed out all the bad interface choices, upped the dialogue and maybe checked their weapon balance issues. As it is now, there's probably a ton of better wave shooters out there, so go buy those instead.", "recommendationid": "34836213", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517300", "timestamp_created": 1504959964, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_forever": 245, "last_played": 1506229452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "steamid": "76561198005186949"}, "votes_up": 7}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
