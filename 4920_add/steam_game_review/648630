First off, the idea of a mech based diablo like 'hack n' slash' is something I've wanted for a very long time.  This game is a bargain basement execution of such no matter how you look at it though.  Everything about this game is cheep and cheesy.  About the only positives I can say about the game is that the controls work, and the mech customization features are decent.\n\nThere are absolutely no rpg elemts to this game what so ever so don't go into it thinking there will be level progression.  The only progression in this game is the parts you pick up for your mech.  which gets old rather fast since there is very little variety in parts other than their stats and apperence.  All the equipment functions pretty much the same,  There's only a handful of different weapon types and the difference between them is mostly stats.  No different types of legs either, not that it matters since your mech simply hovers everywhere reguardless.  They couldn't even be bothered to animate a walking cycle.\n\nthe enemy and map variety is lame as well.  There's only a handful of small maps that are basically all the same city streets or underground coredors later in the game.  You'll fight the same handful of enemies over and over as well, repeated in different 'tiers' of increesing stats.\n\nOverall.  Mechanically its functional,  but there is next to no variety in anything, from gear, to enemies to maps.  I wouldn't recomend anyone pay more than 5$ this game.", "recommendationid": "35110386", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503735", "timestamp_created": 1506017263, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_forever": 84, "last_played": 1505777680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041329537"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506307319, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "...well you tried.\n\nBut seriously this game is pretty much Armored Core meets Diablo with loot shooter elements, but the problem is its so stale and boring that it ceases to be fun about halfway through. The end game content is unsatisfying and getting S ranks on the missions is tedious instead of a challenge. The story puts you to sleep. The part selection and paint is bare minimum and the stats are never explained. All the bosses are basically giant versions of the normal mechs with cheap tactics and that's only if they work properly. I had two of the final bosses glitch out on me quite a few times. It was hilarious but sad at the same time. Also the Hero Creation extension is basically playing the game all over again, with slightly different dialogue and 3 additional missions. I S ranked all the missions in this game just so I can get my money's worth but jeez I only did it cause I was bored.", "recommendationid": "35195014", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501260", "timestamp_created": 1506307270, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 42, "playtime_forever": 2824, "last_played": 1505168802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198334223230"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_negative": 5, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 5}, "success": 1}
