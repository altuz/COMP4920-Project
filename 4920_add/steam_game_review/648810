The tracks are very challenging.  But it's fun to try to do the track as fast as possible with reckless abandon (I suggest this over carefully thought out and methodical, but to each their own). \n\nI just wish the reset and car flip options were mapped to the controller.  The game could also use a menu option and a tutorial.  \n\nRate 9/10 \n\n", "recommendationid": "34408814", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1503379036, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 16, "last_played": 1503378805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
