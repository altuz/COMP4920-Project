I quite like a good indie game, having said that; most of my library consists of indie games. I understand the limitations of indie game devlopment as well as that quite often devlopers overcharge for games such as this. \nThis looked alright from the description etc, jumpscares and things make for alright indie horror games even where budget is low so I was quite hopefull going into it. \n\nGameplay; So it plays as your box standard arcade horror game, you can walk, run, use your flashlight etc. At the beginning you have to avoid the monster, then later on you get a gun and the monsters have to avoid you, pretty simple.\n\nMy recommendation is based on the price being reduced at \u00a32.87, I don't think, in my opinion, that it is worth almost \u00a35 (But then I guess price is subjective). I'd recommend based on that it is a working game, the inital few levels looks like the devloper put some thought into the design and built up quite an atmosphere considering the graphics etc. However once you get a gun, it turns into a shooter and that turned me off of the game to be honest. I will play forward and try to beat the game and will adjust my review if required. It was somewhat jarring how the game switches pace and that serves to kill the atmosphere created thus far which is a shame, as it did actually have me on edge for the first two levels.\n\nJust for anyone still on the fence about how the game plays etc I've made a video (No adverts etc) purley as a first look and to show raw footage of the game, as I can't find any other videos of it out there. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4RsOGafijM&t=12s", "recommendationid": "32291035", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506809", "timestamp_created": 1497012812, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1497018836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080341166"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497945217, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 32, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 41, "review": "This game I played for long time.
