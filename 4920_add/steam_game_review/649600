Simply put.\nIt has multiple bugs, most not game breaking though some are, annoying sound bugs, a bad imitation of the old music, terrible voice acting and confusing new awful \"features\".\nIt has its charm in that kind of way that something absolutely awful can be funny or intriguing, like when you can't look away at a car crash. So that i can give it but beyond that it's worse than the damn flash game!\nAnd also, dont buy this.

So it's is definitly worth it's low pricetag.\n\nIf you played the flash games and you enjoyed them than this is a must-buy. \nIf you're just someone who's looking for a cheap game and came across this, you can try an old-school demo version of this on all sorts of flash game websites, just type in 'Swords and Sandals 2', and see if you like it beforing buying this.\n\nTLDR\nBummer that it doesn't have the original soundtrack.\nIt has some bugs but not gamebreaking.\nIt has more than enough content for it's pricetag.\nIf you enjoyed the flash games this is a must-buy\nIf you never played one of the flash games do it before buying this.\n", "recommendationid": "34949157", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "timestamp_created": 1505398105, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 793, "playtime_forever": 311, "last_played": 1505480511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079576422"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504750136, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "An extremely fun and engrossing game, I am not sure about the bug reports as the game has not crashed once (and my steam hours do not reflect the total time as I run alot of games outside of steam due to it's awful \"steam webhelper\" that leave 100 instances open with massive memory leaks...   actually causing the crashes, not the games) I suggest trying to run your games outside of Steam once in a while, no this wont record your game hours, but what is more important to you? showing everyone how long you played a game for or the actual game?
