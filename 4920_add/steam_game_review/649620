It is a historic tour. The attention to detail, the thousands of hours that must have gone into the custom models and researching the history are appropriately represented in the price tag, given the smaller target audience.\n\nPROS: \n\nThe ship appears painstakingly, faithfully recreated. I'm curious to see how far that goes - I would not be surprised to find the framing and joinery reasonably represented.\n\nI was surprised at the subtle detail in the culture and procedure that was represented. Both in the explanations of daily life and even diet, as well as observing the procedure for gunnery practice I learned an incredible amount. It shows even some obvious points that you really wouldn't think of without being there: looking at the bow and realizing the draft marks were metric (I'm used to reading feet and inches) for example, and then seeing she's drawing about the proper 30-some feet.\n\nCONS: \n\nThe audio translation appears to be voiced by a very monotone text-to-speech engine. The subtitles sometimes exhibit errors in grammar and technical word choice.\n\n(This is not a game, and has a very specific, often technical, researcher, or military target audience).\n\nWhile there is apparent incredible attention to detail, I have no easy means of assessing the authenticity of the details aside from one-by-one. I'm curious now to confirm if they really would use a bugle aboard.\n\nWhile the English translation was sufficient to make this an enjoyable ship to visit, it is clear I am missing and incredible amount as I do not speak Japanese.", "recommendationid": "34366356", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568710", "timestamp_created": 1503208983, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1503207226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014758313"}, "votes_up": 43}, {"timestamp_updated": 1503761195, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Nice tour and very informative.
