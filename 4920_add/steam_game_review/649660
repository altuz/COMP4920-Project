There is not much of a game right now, there are waves of orc zombies who attack you and even though they are wearing armor? has no affect on game play. Reloading in this game is unnecessarily complicated, and guns are not even effective. Hopeful that this game will have a campagin soon, as of now its just the worst wave shooter out.. could not make a more dull game. Oh and don't drop your weapon... or its gone forever", "recommendationid": "33408618", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495547", "timestamp_created": 1499617919, "author": {"num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 245, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1499617532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990442199"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
