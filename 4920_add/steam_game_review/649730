It isn't and it doesn't. UI Is glued to your face just like the preview images suggest. There are a few little neat experiences which can be missed if you just plow through the fifteen minute main story line but even admittedly charming the shallow hidden depths of this game don't come anywhere near justifying anymore than maybe four or five dollars of the $16.99 they're asking for. It's honestly not an awful expience but for such a brief title the price of this charming escape room game doesn't seem justified.", "recommendationid": "34532989", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509709", "timestamp_created": 1503850097, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 293, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1503750850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996826667"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
