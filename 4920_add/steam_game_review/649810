And I have finished all the quests. \nI do recommend the game but I do have some pointers. \n\n[b]Negative stuff[/b]\n[*]The game is too short. After 3 and a half hour I have finished the quests. \n[*]The story isn't very exciting. I won't go into details but you really don't have much of a plot in this game. Don't play it for the story. \n[*]The game lags when you're sprinting. \n[*]The artwork during the dialogue is nicely done, but it would have been nice with some different expressions of the characters. \n\n[b]Positive stuff[/b]\n[*]QUESTS! Man, we have so few horse games that can run on Windows 10 atm. And this game actually explores (very little) the aspect of having quests and choosing how you want to play the game. \n[*]Very beautiful scenery and a huge area to explore by yourself. \n[*]The music is nice and calm. No hate for it from me. \n\nI make add more points later on. What you should know is; the game is very short and it doesn't have much of a story. Spoiler: [spoiler]You only run around and catch some cows, find missing stuff and figure out that Windstorm is from Spain.[/spoiler]\n\nIf you're willing to spend 20\u20ac on a short game storywise, but with a lot of exploring in a lovely scenery, then this is the game for you! \n\nIf you're looking for a great story where you really explore a lot a different ways to be around/with horses, then this isn't the game for you. \n", "recommendationid": "34888466", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506210", "timestamp_created": 1505156375, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 26, "playtime_forever": 204, "last_played": 1505155638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198187955995"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "8 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 8, "total_positive": 7, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
