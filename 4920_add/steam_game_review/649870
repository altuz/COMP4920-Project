In Blur, you race and shoot your opponents to slow them, you can take the pickups to get boost, rockets etc. But this game is deatmatch on 1 small map and thats all. There are only 3 pickups, first is rockets, second is health and third is barrel of something that just do nothing! I know, the version of the game is 0.2, but it isnt worth the price and I think, it wont get better. Physics are disaster and handling is the worst! If you drive fast and want to turn another side, you will get the worst slide in your life. \n\n+ Good looking graphics\n+ Split screen multiplayer\n+ Customization of your car (4 colours and 1 paint job with 3 colours - better than nothing)\n\n- Handling is too sensitive and the car isnt handable at higher speed\n- Only 3 cars\n- Only 1 map\n- Only 3 pickups and 1 doesnt do anything\n- Indicators on the bottom of screen - radar isnt working\n- Empty servers\n- Game looks better on the lower graphic settings than on the highest\n- When you fall on the roof of your car, you will just get respawned automatically\n- The worst car sounds\n- It just isnt fun\n\nIf you looking at an action racing game choose Flatout 2, Flatout Ultimate Carnage or Blur. Dont buy this, its waste of money and it wont be good if they make it free. \n[b] Its just a racing nightmare. 1/10 [/b]", "recommendationid": "33335880", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524467", "timestamp_created": 1499413800, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_forever": 26, "last_played": 1499411917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198162697615"}, "votes_up": 12}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499722486, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "It is not even funny how bad this game is.
