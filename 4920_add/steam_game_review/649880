The atmosphere is realy good and everthing looks very immersive. But as long there is no interaction , this experience is not so good as is could be. It would be nice for example to go to the DJ and interact wirh him to change the songs, or that you can invite someone to dance wirh you , or you can tell someone to leave the Disco. Also important is that there are more diversity in the dance moves , because after a while , the people look like they are in a timeloop. And maybe a little bit rework of the faces , because some of the people look really creapy....\nAlso would be great to see maybe some more settings like a 70\u00b4s Diso or a 50 \u00b4s Setting. Something like your personal Disco time machine. \nFinaly i think the concept has good potential when a few things will be add in the future. Just to see for example how was the atmosphere in a disco at the specific time....", "recommendationid": "33770433", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510829", "timestamp_created": 1500917274, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 93, "playtime_forever": 215, "last_played": 1503268755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116235288"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500856805, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "So you think you can dance?  Obviously, you don't need VR to dance and this game will add nothing but visual effects to your dancing.  You won't learn a dance and you won't dance with anybody.  However, you can dance with yourself and see a disco setting.  There should be more dancers in the dance floor, but it's great to listen to music using the Youtube browser and just be silly.  Nice visual effects (although it could be more realistic looking)\n\nI played with the Oculus Rift and touch support worked fine.  I just wish the game would encourage you to mirror a dancer on the floor or at least give you the appearance of a dance partner.  The avatars do not change their dance \"settings\" regardless of the song.  Hope dev adds ability to play your own songs locally and multiplayer.\n\nRating: 7/10 (given the price)", "recommendationid": "33756060", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500490", "timestamp_created": 1500856805, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 42, "last_played": 1503812526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 8, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
