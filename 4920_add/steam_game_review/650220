It takes quite a bit of practice to land a shot on a distant planet with the simple weapons you begin with. ofcourse as the game progresses the player obtains weapons that hit their mark a little easier but so does the AI or your oppenents. My only complaint with the game is that the attack phase in the late game becomes very chunky, This is not because the game is complicated or taxing in itself but because it was designed in the Unity engine, a sub par engine that gets more attention than it deserves because it is simple to program with. Other than that it is a good game.", "recommendationid": "34901226", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "timestamp_created": 1505223413, "author": {"num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 267, "playtime_forever": 562, "last_played": 1504788608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198257286999"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505361889, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Fun game and very challenging.
