Runs poorly even on lowest setting. The physics of machines feels odd, it is not even close to heavy machinery. The feeling is more like 3y old kid pushing his toys over a sandbox. The terrain response to digging is very off. Overall it is far from what is advertised. \nI tried to play it, but it is \"wrong\" on too many levels. Also the game / terrain model is not inovative at all. So potential for better or unique experience is zero from very beginning. -JEM-", "recommendationid": "34991559", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499012", "timestamp_created": 1505552286, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_forever": 140, "last_played": 1505550448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198209729703"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 60, "total_positive": 42, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
