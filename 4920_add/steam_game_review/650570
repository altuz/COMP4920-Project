Not everything is perfect, like moving from place to place is rather cumbersome and the puzzles are pretty easy so far.\n\nAll in all an interesting approach and the story is interesting, putting the game in future space stations including high tech concepts such as [spoiler]AI's, quasi-hacking and digital brains[/spoiler].\n\nIt is a little buggy though, I encountered two bugs so far that block further progress until restarting the game resetting it to the last savepoint. This is annoying, but I'm sure these issues will be ironed out quickly as the devs seem to actively monitor issue reports and are fixing them quickly.", "recommendationid": "34815247", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500312", "timestamp_created": 1504879606, "author": {"num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 453, "playtime_forever": 577, "last_played": 1505498860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970403249"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 17, "total_positive": 17, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
