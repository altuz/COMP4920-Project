Firstly, when you press to move forward you move 2 steps, which is annoying. The stepping issue actually effects the gameplay because of the tight spaces the player is in. Some of the sounds are just straight up pulled from bioshock, whcih is strange. The door opening sound throws you out of the gaming experience and into AIM nostalgia. I stopped recording because I ran out of battery and just started stumbling around and could not see anything. Ran out of battery at 39% which does not seem quite right. In its current state it seems that not only is it not worth the money but it will most likely not drastically improve. Seems that the snapshots shown were nitpicked and do not give an accurate representation. Getting a refund and would not reccomend.\n\nEdit: And one other thing. The flashlight is so wonkey. It is so small, you are able to make it bigger but the second you get close to something the flashlight goes away.", "recommendationid": "34006899", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1501816238, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 25, "playtime_forever": 12, "last_played": 1501815692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198201886906"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501696286, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 5, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I think this game has more potential than people are giving credit. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty good.
