You probably know this, but I didn't :D )[/i]\n\n------\n\n[h1]Aug 4: Game release[/h1]\n\nI was working on the [b][i]manual[/i][/b] before I got sidetracked onto one million issues to fix before release. Now that the game is out and fairly stable I will work over the weekend and should have the [b][i]manual ready early next week[/i][/b], likely as a self-executing browser reference.\n\n[h1]Aug 15: Manual is coming out [b][i]next Friday[/i][/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]Aug 28: Manual nearly ready[/h1]\n\nHopefully sometime [b][i]during this week[/i][/b] will be releasing first version along with the next update providing substantial improvements to gameplay and many bug fixes/tweaks much requested by users.\n\n[h1]Sept 29: Time of this review[/h1]\n\nSeven Fridays later, still no manual.\n\nAll this is from the official news the developer releases.\n\n-------\n\nI payed \u20ac40 \u2013 the 10% discount which, I think, is a lot of money for a game. But I thought about the 600-hours playthrough and that it will be worth my money. I was really anxious to get into it, I still am actually. The game is fun, exciting and deep. After playing 10 hours I thought: \u201cI\u2019ll make a new party and start the game for real now.\u201d This is the moment you need a manual. \u2018Cause this is a stats game, it has a ton of numbers attached to it. Tons of different races, classes, attributes and skills. Which is great, cause I enjoy complexity. Like most people in this game genre do, I think. But the problem is that you don\u2019t have a clue what any of it [i]really[/i] means without a manual.\n\n-------\n\nNow some people will be saying: [i]\"Yes but you got the wiki, it\u2019s all explained there.\"[/i] or [i]\"You are an idiot. You can easily figure out what all the stats stand for by thinking logicly. If you can't figure out what the stats mean by yourself, then you shouldn't even play this game.\"[/i]\nTo this I say: \"No, it isn\u2019t and thats b0llocks sir\" :P. \n\nLet me give an example: Strength  \n\nThe wiki states: \nControls a characters ability to penetrate armor with a weapon, force doors, lift gates and perform other muscular feats. \n\nWell no shlt sherlock, you don\u2019t need a wiki to know that stuff :D\n\nWhat I want to know is:\n[List]\n\t[*]Does strength affect every class the same way?\n        I don't think so, cause that would mean a thief's and warrior's build are the same (as in a thief also needing to build stength to penetrate and actually deal damage)\n\t[*]Does it affect every race the same?\n\t[*]Does strength increase the damage you inflict?\n\t[*]If it does affect damage, is this the case for all weapons and classes?\n        Is strength for example a primary stat for a ranger, who uses a bow?\n\t[*]If it does affect damage, does it apply this to all types of attack equally (bash, swing, stab,...)?\n\t[*]It looks like it doesn\u2019t affect the to-hit chance, is this true for all classes?\n        In a lot of games warrior classes take strength as the to-hit stat.\n        If it doesn't, then that would again mean a thief and a warrior have the same build (as in a warrior also needing to build dexterity to actually be able to hit somebody.)\n\t[*]So it helps penetration. Does this apply equally to every type of attack or not?\n\t[*]It says: \"It helps penetration with a weapon,\" so does an unarmed strike count as a weapon? Cause unarmed strike is a weaponskill in the game.\n[/list]\t\nThese are some of the questions you get when playing the game and this is just one of the 12 attributes. Then there are still the 44 skills. And I'm not even talking about the hidden differences between the races, like mana, stamina regeneration, etc\n\nCan you play the game without all this information? Yes I guess you can, just make 4 tanky warriors, a healer and 3 mages and you'll probably be fine in novice difficulty. But then you are only using 10% of the gamemechanics. [b][i]What is the use of such a deep, complex game, if you're only gone use 10% of it? This is why I give it a negative review, cause without information you can't play the game for real, not like it is intended.[/i][/b] I like to know what I\u2019m doing, that is the fun for me in a game like this. I like to know why that fight is so difficult, why my spell fizzled, why my warrior didn't hit, why my thief keeps failing his backstab,\u2026  And then change my build and tactics accordingly. But for that you need information, like all games in this genre have. \n\n-------\n\nSo why is there still no manual? If you look at the news and forum discussions, it looks it would take 1 or 2 days work to finish. He says: \u201dI\u2019ll work on it this weekend and it will be done.\u201d Then a few days later he says: \u201cI didn\u2019t work on it but I\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d  A few weeks later: \u201cSomething came up, so I didn\u2019t work on it, but I\u2019ll do it now.\u201d And so on. And it\u2019s not like there are a lot of updates in the meantime. This is not only frustrating but also strange. So why? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll leave it up to you.  \n\nSome of my thoughts on this:[spoiler]Is he lazy? Not committed? Does he have a lot of personal stuff going on? Or does he not know all the fine, inner workings of the game he made, over the course of 20 years, anymore?\n(I\u2019ll probably get banned for this :D) [/spoiler]\n\n-------\n\nDon\u2019t buy it before the manual is out, let\u2019s hope that will still be in 2017.\nDon't buy it before the steam rating is back above mixed. \u2018Cause when the manual is released I\u2019ll play this game, probably enjoy it and change this review.

I love it so freaking much! I saw this and thought, wow this is a new wizardry of old!\nNow I know that people will bash me for only playing over 7 hrs but hear me out on this.\nI WANT to play the game is the key word. But when your saves randomly keep getting wiped from updates,\nand you don't know what some stats are or what they do, you kind of get annoyed. I progressed a bit yes, but this is the kicker, there is no manuel. \nWithout a manuel, how would you have ever played the wizardry games of old? Not well. I would trade out the auto maping for a manuel. I can use grid paper, but without a maneul..... come on. I have waited for over a month now and there is still no maneul. At best this is early access.\nWhy I state early access, bugs that re-set progress upon updates, no manuel, and no explination. Problem is that this game has been in developement for 20 years so... I don't think the early access tag would work.\n\nIn conclusion, I wanted to like this game. It seems for me. But due to the fact that there is no rudementary manuel, I don't want to play it. I don't like that my saves get erased, and I do not like this enough to actually write a review. If you have a semi done manuel, release it. A maneul is not hard, but it is essential for some people who are not going to dedicate 10 hours just to figure it out. Those ten hours in my opinion, should be used for enjoyment and discovery.

I made a pretty bad party, but there are enough ways to play to pretty much make any class work. \nThe game is pack full of content. The maps remain interesting and form a cohesive world. I was looking forward to every area I entered, and figuring out how to open up new paths kept me interested throughout the entire game. There are tons of items, weapons, and spells, with almost all of them being useful in some degreee. I used almost every single spell I found at least a few times during my playthrough. \n\nHowever, there are some fairly major bugs that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. NPCs will not spawn after the first encounter in some areas, resulting in some broken questlines. Furthermore, there are some balance issues with spells and enemies. After a certain point there is no need to use most spells other than a couple which can wipe the enemy team. Finally, the inventory management system really leaves something to be desired. Trying to sort the inventory is a major hassle, and even when everything is organized it is hard to find the item you need.\n\nOverall, I think the base game is a wonderful dungeon crawler that keeps itself interesting from start to finish. If bugs and glitches can be properly tuned, I think the game would have been better received. Still, if you can make it past the $40 price tag, there is plenty of fun dungeon crawling to be found.", "recommendationid": "35077920", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1505884543, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 3934, "last_played": 1504018347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198024192685"}, "votes_up": 17}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505568269, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 27, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "To keep this short: the major cons for me are that there are some bad individual art assets in the game and there's a few tricks you're going to want to learn early on to make your life easier.

Go read up before you play, and then throw yourself in with a few new characters and have fun. It lacks a tutorial, so you do really need to read up before hand.\n\nSet aside a few evenings for this and be prepared to have oodles of content thrown at you.
