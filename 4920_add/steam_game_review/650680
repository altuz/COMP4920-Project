I'm speaking as someone who [i]hates[/i] visual novels as a rule. Even the best examples of the genre are rife with clunky prose and atrocious pacing, and I simply don't have the patience for them. [i]Golem Creation Kit[/i], however, flows effortlessly, with smart prose and easy charm. It's a short, well-paced tale with some branches and genuine surprises, and shows that visual novels don't need to be densely-packed epics to be engaging.\n\nThe third thing that you should know is that while [i]Golem Creation Kit[/i] has its share of glitches, the developer is extremely diligent about addressing them. During my playthrough I encountered a (game-stopping) bug, but I received a response within minutes of posting about it on the forums, and it was fixed within the hour.\n\nLeaving glitches aside, [i]Golem Creation Kit[/i] isn't without other issues. The mechanics are initially confusing, the interface can be unfriendly, and the golem-crafting is at best a diversion, and at worst an unwelcome distraction. The problem is that it has very little bearing on the plot - at least as far as I have seen, but I haven't seen all the branches - and seems to exist primarily to gate your progress. At several points I found myself thinking that I would gladly take the visual novel part without the accompanying gameplay. However, with perseverance, frustration gives way to understanding, and the challenge of building specific golems with runewords and ever-dwindling resources becomes an interesting affair in its own right.\n\nAs it stands, I recommend [i]Golem Creation Kit[/i] on the strength of its charm and intelligent writing, albeit with caveats. With some quality of life upgrades my recommendation would be unequivocal, and thankfully, as at the time of writing, the developer seems dedicated to making the title the best it can be.\n\nIn the meantime, [i]Golem Creation Kit[/i] is still well worth the price of admission. There are mysteries to solve, multiple endings and play modes to uncover, a creepy-ass mirror and a bird who is more charming than he has any right to be.
