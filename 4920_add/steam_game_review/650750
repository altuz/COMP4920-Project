On my first attempt I sucked at the game, so I had to restart.

The game has some curveballs, but that's basically it. Nice and straight-forward, I guess.\n \nIt's slow at first, you're waiting for stuff to build, but before you know it you have this sprawling colony with buildings and mines and towers everywhere, so there's always stuff to do/defend/manage/repair. You play on a giant map with different areas that have their risks and rewards, for example there's this canyon that enemies can't reach or a volcano area that seems to have more resources. There's also city-building-management stuff that blends in with the tower defense stuff pretty naturally, and it's kind of RTS-ish because you can move virtually everything around.\n \nRecommended to anyone who likes seeing waves of enemies being mowed down with turrets, it can get crazy and oddly addicting (you keep wanting to do JUST ONE MORE THING).", "recommendationid": "34886401", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501963", "timestamp_created": 1505148743, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "playtime_forever": 668, "last_played": 1505148480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198419833622"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504971927, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Quality game from developers-veterans of the industry.
