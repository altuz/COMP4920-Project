Very simple yet fun combat mode, allowing you to strategize your moves and counter moves. The characters in the game is in depth and have their own personalities, which doesn't feel generic, even the bad guys or passers by. \n\nI played and completed the Chinese version because the original feel and bad English translations. Some small bugs around but doesn't matter much. Quests both mainline and side, are fulfilling and fun. Overall very good game if you understand Chinese. Endings are nice and different paths.

This game is everything that Tale of Wuxia wasn't, it removed the dating aspects and visual novel training aspects and went with a complete and proper rpg, which was clamored for when the original was released. Let's get the negative out of the way first. \n\nPositives & Negative: Some of these are negative/positive depending on the player\n1: Yes the translation is shoddy in many places, but easily readable, there is chinese text at times, usually only with poems, songs and qoutes from Chinese history. \n2: Often you are in a hurry, but you actually got all the time in the world as they completely got rid of time and day and night cycle, that said this is both POSITIVE and Slightly Negative, as you really need to power up sometimes. \n3: You can sell items that lead to quests or to advanced manuals, which makes them unobtainable, I love and hate this x'D! \n4: No handholding, I personally like this a lot, but I imagine that people who aren't used to using a lot of time on quests and or are new to RPG's might have difficulty with this. \n5: A lot of martial arts(great) but too many, and you have limited slots of learning, I for example learned one internal style early on that I realised I didn't want to have learnt, but at that point it was too late in the game. I understand why, but for new players be selective, the majority of arts you will never use, but you can teach them to the party members you won't be rotating regularly.\n6: Lady Taya learns Yi Jin Jing, Shaolin marrow cleansing and brain washing internal qigong, there is several issues here! First of from what little is left of the original manual(irl) it can only be practiced by men. Second off she is starting her martial arts practice too late yet masters many arts and have a high energy bar, now I wouldn't complain about that normally, but when she goes and learns one of the best internal arts that is supposed to be a secret by the way, told earlier that great grandmaster of Shaolin only taught it to a few of the students, which she is not. Personally and although it is to a great help, I'd recommed that she cannot learn it, maybe she finds it? but it shouldn't be learnable by any female.\n7: introduces some of the minigames from the previous game, but it doesn't make much sense as you'll be barely use it, except for creating armor or medicine, of which there is little options anyhow. \n8: Some quests don't pop up in the mission menu, but they are still active, so you have to try and figure it out yourself.\n9: Skill should show what they actually do in combat, as having to teach it and then enter combat, end combat and reload to avoid the skill is a pain.\n\nPositive:\n1: Looks great, the moves look great.\n2: Combat is a lot of fun\n3: Quests are great, I went away from the main quest did several intricate side quests, only to find out it was all connected anyway, which I loved, the world feels connected!\n4: depending on who you have in your party you can do different things, but most importantly start different quests. \n5: Party members have good motivations for joining you, almost all of them at least.\n6: music fits the mood in most instances\n7:  can be genuinely hard sometimes with some of the conditions required to advance. \n8: overworld is easy to navigate\n9: Rumours are fun, although I rarely see any direct effect from them. \n\nRumour: The pervert has caught a strange disease at a whorehouse! x'D \n\nOverall I'm having the more fun with this game than I have had with other RPG's in a long time, it is very unique, considering there isn't any real good wuxia mmo's, you have some xuanhuan, or some might say jade empire, but this is really the only wuxia rpg that I have ever played. \n\nHad the translation been per\n", "recommendationid": "35222410", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1506434556, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 7653, "last_played": 1507062758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6042, "steamid": "76561198113338163"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506156600, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "A decent, solid RPG with classic approach in fresh and interesting setting.\nPros: \n- Half-open world with free roaming and random encounters that can trigger quests.\n- Turn-based tactical fights on hexagonal fields.\n- Several interesting quests, items and styles that you can miss if you don\u2019t pay attention. \n\n Cons:\n- Translation is far from being perfect.\n- If you don\u2019t take a look at guide or thread with tips in \"Discussions\" from time to time - you may suck hard.\n- It\u2019s possible to ruin your characters and realize it 30 hours after.\n- It's prequel, so you won\u2019t see any serious development if you have played the original (until you finish the game).\n\nThere are many negative reviews, that are crying about unbearable mess of bugs.\nDuring 80 hours of  playing the game I have encountered only one bug, which was quickly patched by hotfix.", "recommendationid": "35147742", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502220", "timestamp_created": 1506156361, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 279, "playtime_forever": 5004, "last_played": 1505668824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198028743314"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504710433, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u662f\u4f18\u8d28\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u7559\u610f\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u51e0\u70b9\uff1a\n1\uff09\u79d8\u7c4d\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f1a\u88ab\u6d88\u8017\u6389\uff1f\u5403\u4e0b\u53bb\u4e86\u5417\uff1f\uff1f\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fee\u7ec3\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u6b66\u529f\u3002\u60f3\u8c61\u4e00\u4e0b\u5927\u5e08\u5144\u548c\u8427\u7476\u540c\u65f6\u6253\u51fa\u9189\u62f3\u4e92\u76f8\u652f\u63f4\uff0c\u8be5\u662f\u4f55\u5176\u58ee\u89c2\u3002\n2\uff09\u6b66\u529f\u5408\u51fb - \u4f8b\u5982\u80e1\u5bb6\u5200\u6cd5\u548c\u82d7\u5bb6\u5251\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u5f00\u653e\u5408\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u201c\u5200\u5251\u5f52\u771f\u201d\uff0c\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u961f\u5458\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u52a8\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u961f\u5458\u5b66\u4e60\u5929\u4e0b\u65e0\u72d7\uff0c\u53d1\u52a8\u201c\u6253\u72d7\u68cd\u9635\u201d\u3002\u4ec5\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002\n3\uff09 \u5f00\u653e\u5929\u8d4b\u4e66\uff0c\u8ba9\u961f\u5458\u5b66\u4e60\u5404\u5f0f\u7684\u5929\u8d4b\u6280\u80fd\u3002\n4\uff09 \u5f00\u653e\u66f4\u591a\u961f\u5458\u5165\u961f\u3002\u3002\u3002\u4e0d\u7136\u6bcf\u6b21\u5254\u9664\u518d\u62db\u8058\u3002\u3002\u3002\u610f\u4e49\u4f55\u5728\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f", "recommendationid": "34777182", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506069", "timestamp_created": 1504710433, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 67, "playtime_forever": 3724, "last_played": 1505115978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198022536923"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507008828, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Highly recommended for hardcore RPG Simulation Players.
