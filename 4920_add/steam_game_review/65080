Sometimes plot holes can be  excused, but these are of the severe type that if you catch them you'll be wondering, \"Where did he come from?\" or \"How does he know all of this?\" And its never explained later on  how one of the characters knows what he knows(which would have  been acceptable).\n\nBut if you want something quick, and easy and  it requires a little bit of brain power (some puzzles are okay, some are a bit...odd, for lack of a better word) then this game is for you.

For those who aren't too familiar with PnC games, this is a decent introduction to the genre.  The game offers two different modes, casual and adventure, depending on if you want clues or not.  The clues offered in casual mode are mostly useless, unless you really don't pay any attention to what you have to do.  There are two pixel hunts throughout the entire game that threw off my rhythm (not too bad compared to other games).  Most of the puzzles are pretty intuitive.  The overall story and gags aren't as good as what you would expect from the Lucas Arts games, but it still was fun overall, and you can get through the game in under 3 hours if you are sharp on detail.\n\nBottom line, get it if you are a big fan of the Lucas Arts series, or if you are new to the PnC adventures.  It isn't one of the best games, but it is fun and humorous none the less."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1453792090, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505360", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "20761356", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099275658", "num_reviews": 29, "last_played": 1453788319, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 425}, "timestamp_updated": 1453792090, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game was rather enjoyable. I feel like this game is a very good starting point if you are new to point and click adventure games. The reason for this is the game is not too difficult, but there are some pretty good puzzles that make you think (I believe the puzzles are what define this style the most, since other aspects are easily found in other styles of games). I think that there are some games out there that take the puzzles too far to the point of frustration for veteran point and click adventure gamers, as well as those new to these games. For someone like me, I can live with some of these less desirable parts because I have witnessed some truly astounding games of this style! But sadly for some newcomers, they leave before they can see the great aspects that these types of games have to offer. Therefore, I think this game is a good safe start if you are looking to try out these types of games.\n\nOn a more negative note, the game sadly was not a very long one, which in turn made the story very short and a little bit under developed. The story turned out to be decent enough, but remember I said decent, not \"the greatest thing since sliced bread\". I was also not super into the style of the art and design of the game, but while I wasn't into how the game looked I have to admit that I think many people would enjoy the art of the game and many would also consider the art to be quite good. One last thing that you will have to live with is reading text. No voice acting. Again, not something that someone who played any of the older Sierra and Lucasarts games would have a problem with, but others might.\n\nSo while this game does not fall in my top tier of point and click adventure games, I didn\u2019t feel like it had any glaring problems either and I do believe that the game is worth a try for fans old and new. If you have some spare time pick up this game, sit back, relax, and enjoy your next voyage in space.\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!"}, {"votes_down": 16, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1388788638, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506664", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8541177", "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198038570229", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1388811331, "num_games_owned": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 209}, "timestamp_updated": 1388788638, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Started off as a fun and goofy adventure game with some genuinely difficult puzzles, even on casual mode.
