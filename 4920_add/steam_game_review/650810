The game-play itself has the basics down, though it could use some polishing in some areas (would be nice to be able to zoom in, the terrain blocks view sometimes, interface is slightly confusing).  Audio feels sub-par.  You can barely hear any background music for some reason.\n\nFirst Impression Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrgfHFlz5b0\n\nThe biggest issue so far is a blandness of quests.  At least from what I've seen in about a half hour of game-play.   There are quest markers and things to do, but feels like there is no overarching motivation or core quest going on.  It's possible the devs wanted to get the game working well before adding some good story, but I'm just speculating here. \n\nDespite that, there are some good quality's as well.  The graphics look pretty good, combat feels familiar, and there are a huge selection of weapons and abilities.  The maps feel very large and are fairly detailed.\n\nWhile I feel $17.00 is a bit expensive for what this game is right now, I'm going to recommend it.  Fans of Diablo will most likely enjoy it, and I think with a few tweaks by the devs, this will turn out to be pretty good.", "recommendationid": "34513538", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513149", "timestamp_created": 1503778989, "author": {"num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 168, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1503770411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984712587"}, "votes_up": 16}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
