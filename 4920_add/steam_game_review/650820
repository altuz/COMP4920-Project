Take the protagonist of Psychic Isolation, who decides to investigate what happened to his family inside a house that already appears to be unwelcoming from the start. For the sake of the story, however, he progresses through the house to read notes and trigger further demented house abuse only to discover his mother has gone insane and his father left for the hospital. This starts a spiral of events that leads him to his sister\u2019s pc (who is also missing), to two phones and to get a blue screen from his own computer. The most shocking aspect of all though is when the final phone is tested, he gets the smart idea to leave the house and the demo ends. I mean the game ends. \n\nHaving played other games in this genre, I could already tell the current build was going to be in short supply. Horror games are generally short, restricted to a single building and have something chase you in order to prolong the experience. This game basically follows the pattern to a tee right down to the jump scare mother who can\u2019t open doors if they are blocked. All of this is fine, but not for the staggering price of entry. Wait for the demo if you are eager to test this out, but until they get another four or so chapters, I wouldn\u2019t even consider getting this at a reduced price. How is the rest of the game though?\n\nVisually the house looks decent with sound quality being the standard creepy music. Movement is on point, but there are some issues with moving certain objects and a couple of them cannot block doors, despite being against them. Lighting is solid and the flashlight thankfully has enough juice to brighten up any room. This makes it easier to find the notes that are scattered around. Unfortunately, this is about all I can say for what equates to a painfully average jump scare/chase horror. You can try out the demo at this URL (  http://psychic-isolation.com ) if you are interested, but I wouldn\u2019t open the door to this one yet. \n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.", "recommendationid": "34259333", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507970", "timestamp_created": 1502815193, "author": {"num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 2901, "playtime_forever": 36, "last_played": 1502812659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000561257"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504142629, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "well once again i buy a game that doesnt even work, cant even get out the front door...got the luggage packed and at the door ready to leave but still insists that i need to stay and get my luggage...sigh!!!", "recommendationid": "34622877", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "timestamp_created": 1504142629, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_forever": 15, "last_played": 1504142449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053602644"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1502840856, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "review": "Here is my playthru \nhttps://youtu.be/Hwd1dHY4_0Y\n\nso.. when i first bought this game. honestly? I got annoyed. If you buy this game as it is right now. you are basically buying the demo. there is only the first level which is exactly the same as the free demo. \n\nHOWEVER\n\nApon playing thru the game, I genuingly very much enjoyed it. If a game is shit, ill be honest i dont get free games and i dont do positive reviews for money etc.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is really good. possibly because of the pretty stunning visuals for a unity game or maybe because of the sound design but it is very well put together. I'm now super excited for the next chapter! \n\nas it is a good 7/10 \n\nWould be better once finished.
