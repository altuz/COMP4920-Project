I dunno if it was ten dollars neat, but it's pretty neat.\n\nIt would be ten dollars neat if it had explosions.\n\nIt would be fifteen dollars neat if I could shoot out tires.\n\nIt would be twenty dollars neat if I decided what runs to take to what city and they rewarded me a precentage of income based on difficulty that I could spend in a store to unlock weapons. And there was some kind of story, like I'm some kind of freelancing diesel security guard and it's dangerous and that's how I live my life and someone explains that.\n\nThat being said, it was a fun experience for the first time.", "recommendationid": "32704819", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524442", "timestamp_created": 1498265881, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 259, "playtime_forever": 75, "last_played": 1506614465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "steamid": "76561198058897502"}, "votes_up": 14}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498264137, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "As fellow devs, we appreciate the effort and level of quality already exhibited in this early access title. We love watching cars veer away after killing the driver and the pile-up that happens when cars collide. We definitely have some things that we would love to see improved, but for an early access title Diesel Express delivers an exhilerating experience different from any we have ever played.\n\n-Make the shooting more accessible. It's really hard to know when you're hitting something.\n-The red effect indicating damage should fade away eventually. Make it easier to understand when you're being hit.\n-Currently the mission selection starts at 6 which is more of a UX thing. It would be nice to have levels given to the player in some kind of progression.\n-We'd love some lore about each route, even if it's a sound clip or line of writing. Your world is so cool!\n-Can we please shoot tires out? Maybe you can do that already, it's just hard to tell.\n\nAltogether a great experience that we're going to be following closely!

But mainly Mad Max.  The premise is simple but effective; defend the train from the marauding band of vehicles.  \n\nThe sense of being in an action scene is palpable!  Do you go for the driver or the gunner?  If I can waste the driver of the car in front of the upcoming truck, will  it cause a pile up?  The mayhem of seeing various vehicles piling up with passengers thown around, and often going under the wheels of ongoing bad guys, often creating further anarchy, is what really gives this game an edge.\n\nThere are some minor niggles; the targeting of guns feels pretty random.  Though I found that when trying to slightly lead the targets it seemed to help (they are moving after all).\n\nI'm really looking forward to how this game develops.  But regardless, this is going to be my go to 'VR fix' for a long time.  This game deserves to succeed. \n\n", "recommendationid": "32789543", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "timestamp_created": 1498426333, "author": {"num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 385, "playtime_forever": 446, "last_played": 1506365033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "steamid": "76561198004899373"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
