And i have to say: What an awesome game it is! If you already don't know what \"Concing\" is, Concing is a skill based movement by usually throwing a Concussion gernade on the ground which is used to push the player forward in a direction of the player's choice. It was pretty common around the early 2000s in the old days of Team Fortress Classic. Concing isn't exactly around anymore and the TFC days are long gone, But, This little indie game brings that back. You will concussion your way to victory by jumping platform to platform until you reach the very end of the level, Along with a timer that keeps track of your score. I would say it's more fun to play with others but sadly this has to be one of the most underrated games on Steam and barely has even a community, And that would be one of my complaints with this game. There is nobody playing it and it really deserves more players. Another thing is that i put a little over 2 hours in game and i've already had beaten most, If not all the levels, There simply isn't enough content. But, The game is new and the developers are always coming out with new updates, So hopefully they'll add more levels and content into the game. I would also say the walking animations aren't really that good and i think they really need to be improved but that isn't really a problem. But at the end of the day, I really look forward to the future for ConcPerfect 2017 and i think it'll be a great game. The gameplay is solid, The Conc physics are spot on, The level design is really impressive, The graphics are really good and sort of cartoon-ish and most importantly, It's fun to play especially with your friends! I highly suggest this to newcomers who have no history with Concing who want to get into it and i recommend to oldschool Concer's who are still interested in Concing. It's really worth it especially for 2.99$!\n\nOverall rating: \n7/10", "recommendationid": "34804309", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514783", "timestamp_created": 1504825817, "author": {"num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 137, "playtime_forever": 118, "last_played": 1504991104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060331848"}, "votes_up": 6}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "4 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 4, "total_positive": 4, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
