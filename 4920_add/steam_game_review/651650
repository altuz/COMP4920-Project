Most of the objects are books or journal pages that you can read, others are weird objects that play a voice-over. There are three minimal puzzles where you have to pick up an item or push a button before you can pass through certain doors. Once you investigate the last room, the game ends. Getting to this point took me about 30 minutes.\n\nThat's apparently all there is to this game, and - sorry, even for this price, that's not enough.\n\nThe texts that you find, detail the culture, history, science, religion, geography, political structure, and more, of a world called Dunia (which is probably one of the most unimaginative names you can give a world, since it just means \"World\" in several languages). The texts are fairly bizarre, which I liked, and I would have been curious about an actual game set in this absurd world. But most of this information is completely irrelevant to the game as it stands, so in the end it's just meaningless exposition. Imagine someone spending an hour explaining a fictional world to you, and then telling an actual \"story\" in three sentences and be done with it - that's the kind of experience that \"Dunia: Masters\" is offering.\n\nThere is also a counter that gets increased for every object that you find. It's meant to go up to 60, though I couldn't find more than 40-something. But I didn't look too hard, so I may have missed something. Searching for hidden objects in pitch black environments (with no way to regulate brightness) is hardly an engaging activity. Once the game has ended, the only way to find more objects is to start from scratch and examine everything again, and even though the game is very short, that seemed too boring a task to go through with it.\n\nGraphically the game is rather crude, and very dark, but at least it runs smoothly thanks to the Unreal engine. It includes very amateurish voice-acting, which does have a certain naive charm - I've heard worse. Unfortunately you are frozen in space during some of the voice-overs, which makes it frustrating and tedious to examine an object again - which is a problem, because some objects [i]have[/i] to be examined twice in order to progress.\n\nHere's what \"Dunia: Masters\" reminds me of: There are many people with a creative spark, who enjoy dreaming up fictional worlds, but then they never [i]do[/i] anything with them, they never cast their ideas into actual stories. That's what separates an actual author (or game designer) from a mere dreamer. The author of Dunia, it seems, is trying to take this step, but has not succeeded yet. Instead of implementing an interesting story, he is mainly showering us with background information that is irrelevant in the context of the game. I hope he [i]does[/i] write a more elaborate story in the future, because I see potential in his bizarre ideas and absurdist humor. But potential alone does not make a good game, and as a game, \"Dunia: Masters\" unfortunately isn't worth peoples' time, sorry to say.", "recommendationid": "32542786", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516396", "timestamp_created": 1497804070, "author": {"num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 7640, "playtime_forever": 78, "last_played": 1497807918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025309409"}, "votes_up": 10}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497827013, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "For what it's supposed to be, it's a good game.
