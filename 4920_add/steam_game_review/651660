I preferred using just the mouse (which is interesting, for me, since I normally prefer a controller).\n\nLore and character backgrounds are interesting and written with care. I suspect I am missing a much larger number of Star Trek and other such references than the few I did get. I shall have to acquire more knowledge in that area at some point.
