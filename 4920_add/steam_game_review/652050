I was always a fan of these minimalistic game designs that just let you pass the time without having to stress over it. \n\nAt first the game seemed like a handful, lots of information but it turned out more simple and fluent in its controls than it seems. Sure its clunky and has some bugs, but is it worth its price? Sure it is! And if you still doubt if you want to buy it check it out on one of the many websites that its on for free! \n\nI personally found the game interesting enough and wanted to support the developer, but its honestly not the greatest of them all. I give it a nice solid 8/10, even though my opinion only matters to me :)", "recommendationid": "32784845", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1498418069, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_forever": 1559, "last_played": 1504977385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198040184873"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498322256, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "What a nice little game! \n\nI am very pleasantly surprised at just how much fun this little dungeon romp is!\n\nI like the loot system, I like the combat system, and I like the simplicity of the game play.\n\nThis isn't to say that there aren't choices to make.
