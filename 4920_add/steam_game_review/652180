There are absolutely no historical records evidencing this nonsense, nor are there any statements by Cleopatra on the same. I expected at any moment that Cleopatra would start explaining how Atlantians/Aliens were the actual builders of the pyramids! An advice to the developer: If you want to make an educational vr experience, stick to solid and established historical and scientific facts and information and do not base your work, even partially, on nonsense, especially in what is supposedly an educational experience.\n\n- Awful graphics from the years 2004 - 2006, which killed off the immersion. I understand that this is an indie developer effort, but come on. The guests looked like lifeless plastic dolls.\n\n- You cannot interact with objects on the table or around you at all. \n\n- Lots of bugs for such a short experience, examples include: the writing paper being stuck in various body parts of the guests or falling on the ground, the guests using the paper instead of the pen to write, occasionally desynchronised audio, Mozzart standing up and waiving his arms in the air as if playing music while no music is playing. \n\n- The same music plays throughout all 3 acts, which becomes boring after a while. \n\n- The waiting period between the end and start of each conversation sometimes took a bit longer than usual. \n\nConclusion: \n\nI hate recommending against this product, but in light of the above cons I have no other alternative. Hopefully the developer will improve upon this experience, or at least take into account the above when developing his next experience.", "recommendationid": "32997328", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514718", "timestamp_created": 1498751973, "author": {"num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 138, "playtime_forever": 65, "last_played": 1498750804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198191505527"}, "votes_up": 14}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
