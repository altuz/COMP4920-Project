There are over 600 flags to learn, from country flags to regional flags. \n\nIf you are up for the challenge, there is endless mode and even endless extreme to test your knowledge about flags. \n\nThe achievements in the game are not to difficult to obtain. The 100 endless achievement can be tricky, especially if you are bad with memorizing flags. \n\nIn my opinion this is the best flag game available on Steam and I would highly recommend it if your into flags, or want to expand your knowledge.\n\n", "recommendationid": "34967241", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523619", "timestamp_created": 1505465546, "author": {"num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 415, "playtime_forever": 622, "last_played": 1505465254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034758692"}, "votes_up": 11}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 10, "total_positive": 10, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
