I walked outside, picked up a gas tank,\nthrew it at one of the townsfolk, and then got shot to death.\nI just started playing again and I'm doing a little better. I still keep dying all the time, but it's entertaining at\nleast. I got diseased by a dog, shot by thugs, poisoned, killed by a ghoul with an axe, and had my head\ncrushed in with a cinder block.\nThe only downside is that the graphics are a bit dated, and the sign textures flip upside-down at night on\nmy computer, but the dev said he would fix this bug soon.\nPROS: You can do whatever you want, huge character customization options, and weird dialogue\nCONS: Shit graphics, low resolution, still a couple minor bugs remaining", "recommendationid": "35319021", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497703", "timestamp_created": 1506736323, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 117, "playtime_forever": 671, "last_played": 1506243663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 665, "steamid": "76561197968491304"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504635637, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 8, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "the real fallout 4", "recommendationid": "34761894", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484347", "timestamp_created": 1504635637, "author": {"num_reviews": 72, "num_games_owned": 394, "playtime_forever": 231, "last_played": 1504720174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994827301"}, "votes_up": 4}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 11, "total_positive": 11, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
