No shit sherlock) and it was developed by an indie developer... Additionally I am a big fan of puzzle games and such stuff which caused me to try this game.\n\nI had no problems solving the puzzles in the early game. Some puzzles are innovative and interesting. Not every puzzle is though (i speak to you: Lights Puzzle), but most of them are. Every game has some weak puzzles. Every puzzle can be figured out logically which makes it fun to progress and proceed through the rooms. The game also has different paths you can take and different endings you can get. Saving, loading and such stuff is no problem, you can do that anytime before important choices.  \n\nI have finished the game, completed all secrets and hidden puzzles. The puzzles in the late-game were really difficult and i had a hard-time figuring them out. The puzzles are great and i definitely would buy this game again for them.\n\nThe big downside is the story though. It`s pretty... weeeird. The story concept is actually not that bad... but [spoiler] come on, the typical Secret Agent plot twist ^^ [/spoiler] thus making the story really mediocre. The dialogue is skippable, which is important for those kind of games (you don`t want to play twice through story sections to reach different endings without being able to skip :p)\n\nAnother thing i like are the hidden puzzles. It`s a good way of including secrets in your game. Some of them are hidden very uncreatively though (at the walls, really?). All in all it`s pretty fun to find them though (some are hidden pretty good!)\n\nYes, due to that i believe I can reccommend the game especially because of the puzzles. The story and dialogue aren`t that good, but it`s not like it`s disturbing the gameplay. The price tag is 6,99 and you get about 10 hours gameplay (yes, i needed that long. Maybe you`re faster... but that`s how long i needed for all endings!). I don`t see anything unfair there, so it`s fine. \n\nThe puzzles are the best reasons why to buy this game. The story is - unfortunately - not that strong.\nYou know, If i ever would have made a game, it would have had a similar concept puzzle-wise like this one ;)", "recommendationid": "32671472", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529740", "timestamp_created": 1498207533, "author": {"num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 580, "playtime_forever": 1891, "last_played": 1499121300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198161727032"}, "votes_up": 16}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498217669, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've been a bit on the fence about this game throughout yesterday and today. On sale the game costs \u00a33.5 and I have 3.5 hours so far so I have my money's worth.\n\nThe game presents itself as an RPGMaker styled locked room/escape the room mystery. I've done a couple of these puzzles in real life and thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect; hunt around the room for clues to solve the puzzles to find keys to open the door. That's all great, fun and challenging.\n\nI came across a few issues while playing. The developer (in the comments below) has been great in responding to them and promising to work on some quality of life improvements. I'll leave these issues at the bottom as a reference.\n\nHowever, overall my review is to recommend this game - this game has an active, engaged developer who is passionate about their game, who talks to the playerbase and tries to improve the experience for the players.\n\nThe experience is fun, quirky and as far as I know, unique. There are different endings dependent on your choices, the story is decent and the puzzles are intricate and challenging on the whole (various difficulty across the game of course). With some of the issues I describe below being sorted, and being informed that you need to manually save I have no major problems with the game. For the price you can definitely get your money's worth from the game, and a lot of enjoyment at the same time!\n\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW ISSUES - DEV COMMENTS BELOW ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS:\n\nFirst of all the dialogue is frustrating in the sense that talking to one of the other people there requires a lot of clicking to progress through it. You'll find yourself talking to or interacting with the same items multiple times and seeing the same dialgoue, but without a way to skip it.\n\nSecondly, I'm currently stuck in one room, where I've been left on my own in a dark maze. Usually when you get stuck the others will offer you clues and assistance. This room, being alone, I have no assistance. I solved the first part and then was presented with a 2nd section which seemingly has no solution - a 6 character and numeric code with only two sets of 4 numbers as options. No doubt it's my issue not figuring it out, but my issue is that there's no assistance to help you out when you're stuck. This could just halt my progress and enjoyment through the game.\n\nThere are also hidden puzzles to solve, but no real way to interact with them. You find a piece of paper for example with a riddle on it alluring to one of the people you're with being phoney/dodgy. It ends with \"I wonder who it is?\". I could guess, but there's no where to input your guess and see if you're right/wrong etc... so \"completing\" these for the clues seems impossible. Maybe you just have to find multiple hidden clues first.\n\nThe achievements seem very specific. I believe there's 5 rooms in any play through (of 7 total) and I'm on room 4 but have had no achievements yet. I'm guessing there's some extra hidden clues or alternative progressions to find in extra play throughs.\n\nMy biggest issue occurred when I reloaded the game. Despite the game appearing to save at every \"checkpoint\" save screen between rooms... I reload the game and it saved nothing of my progress.", "recommendationid": "32670293", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511815", "timestamp_created": 1498205009, "author": {"num_reviews": 45, "num_games_owned": 519, "playtime_forever": 462, "last_played": 1498248954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198031273221"}, "votes_up": 8}, {"timestamp_updated": 1498487654, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Enjoyed the game very much. Not usually fond of puzzle games but I did try the real escape rooms before and really enjoyed that. \n\nThe story is interesting, especially after about halfway through. There are 2 different routes and after doing all the endings my favorite has to be the Escaped route and makes me think there will be more coming. Am I right?\n\nThe puzzles are mostly ok. There are hints that help you, and also a guide when you're stuck so it's really good since you will never be stuck.", "recommendationid": "32817065", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509750", "timestamp_created": 1498487654, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 1193, "last_played": 1499475381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198070726765"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
