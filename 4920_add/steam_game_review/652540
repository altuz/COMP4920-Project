I suppose the price might be a red flag as the level of polish, refinement options are directly reflective of it.   I must say they did include a large amount of art, displayed in various rooms at a decent resolution.  I must give credit for the narrated descriptions although I did run into a few instances where they did not happen.  Overall, MOCOVE ARTS gets the concept right but stumbles on the execution...\n\nPros:\n\n* Ambitious in number of works it presents\n* Artwork is fairly hi res \n* Colors are vivid & artwork really pops\n* Menu & teleport make navigation through the environment easy \n* Narrated descriptions \n* Nice music\n\nCons\n\n* Unless you're facing forward, the descriptions appear to your side or even behind you!  Most of the time I found myself prompted by arrows to turn completely around just to read the description! \n\n* you must use the trigger to enter the description but then the touch pad to leave it! \n\n* Artwork not to scale?I've seen many of the featured works in person and they are just not that big- most of the pieces seem gigantic! Would be nice to get a zoomed in view only when you click on it for more info.\n\n* Perspective seems a bit off-  It feels as if you are floating a few feet above the floor... \n\n* Text 'shimmers' and is difficult to read... perhaps the option to increase font size & or sharpen the resolution & aliasing would fix this.\n\n* Finally, please add more customization options. Ability to choose or change music, anti-aliasing or resolution options etc.\n\nAt this early stage I cannot recommend..", "recommendationid": "33507528", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1499965713, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 75, "playtime_forever": 27, "last_played": 1499906508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065372468"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
