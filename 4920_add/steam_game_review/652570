Fans of the genre really should have this game.\n\nMy first playthrough, on timed mode, took about 10 hours to complete, with 3 stars in each puzzle scene. Tested Casual mode as well for about 20 minutes, but did not play all the way through in that mode, as of this writing. I have very little bad to say about this game, but I'll do the Pros and Cons anyway.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b] [list] [*]Runs perfectly on a toaster, not a single stutter, lag, audio, or fps issue at all for me.[*] Very nice art, a more \"realistic\" cartoon/comic book style. Quite pretty to look at. [*]Pleasant music, repetitive, but just the right volume, and amount of \"urgency\" at times, with a very soothing feeling overall. Audio in the game overall is good, no complaints at all. [*]Difficulty scaling from puzzle to puzzle is well done, very smooth increase in difficulty from one level to the next. [*]Just enough challenge to give a sense of accomplishment. Not rage inducing (like Bejeweled could be...), but not so easy that you don't need to replay some puzzles to get 3 stars on every one. Quite satisfying. [*]Nice little Hidden Object scenes and interesting mini-game Match 3 variations. The Hidden Object scenes were way too easy, but a nice \"resting spot\" between the 4 areas. [*]Interesting and engaging \"shop\" for buffs and items, with buying/improving buildings on the map to purchase these. [*]Combat puzzles- very nice. Match 3, with certain pieces needing to be matched to charge spells for attacks and healing. Next to impossible to lose, but a nice variation on Match 3. [/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b] Short list... only one thing that was a bit \"off\" to me: [list][*]The opening voice dialog to give the story behing the game. In English, the voice was so heavily accented, that if there was no text to read, it would have been almost impossible for me to understand what was being said. [/list]\n\n[b][u]TL;DR[/u][/b] - Really nicely done little Match 3 puzzle game, with a pretty look and sound to it, a decent story for this type of game, and relaxing play. 2 modes make this enjoyable for \"hardcore\" players looking for challenge, and \"casual\" players looking for a light, easy to play, relaxing game. Achievements were not difficult, but required a full playthrough to get legitimately, so no quick 100% for Achievement hunters only. No Trading Cards, so not likely to appeal to Sellers, Traders or Badge Hunters. TC's would be nice, but not neccessary IMHO. Really nice little game, well worth the $4 USD price tag.", "recommendationid": "34335558", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509138", "timestamp_created": 1503086312, "author": {"num_reviews": 68, "num_games_owned": 1242, "playtime_forever": 665, "last_played": 1503199644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198216537667"}, "votes_up": 7}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "5 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 5, "total_positive": 5, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
