One aspect I like about this game is that there\u2019s rarely any exposition. The narrative unfolds to the player through the mood, particularly its overt themes. For instance, part of one level involves finding the broken pieces of a picture of a pregnant woman, presumably your wife. Later you discover you hurt your wife \u2013 while simultaneously being exposed to dead baby props and jump-scares. Solve the puzzle and the story is short, but clear. You most likely hurt your wife while she was pregnant and she then most likely had a miscarriage. I say \u201cmaybe\u201d because the game seems to be the first installment of a series so you never know what might change.\n\nHowever, what really drives home this narrative is the creative level design. You play through roughly four different levels (reality and three depths of your unconsciousness) and they are all so unique. The overarching level planning really communicates the protagonists\u2019 descent into his mind. The deeper you go, the darker the color palettes get, the weirder the sound effects become, the more surreal the environment appears and so forth. I will also quickly state that this game has the best flashlight of all Unity games hands down, [b]but only if you select and apply the \u201cFish-eye Lens\u201d in the options[/b]. It works just like a camera, and the clicking from \u201con\u201d to \u201coff\u201d is immensely satisfying. \n\nOne aspect of this title\u2019s well-executed atmosphere is its sound design. Instead of relying in loud thuds, open and closed doors or high-pitched string instruments, this title creates atmosphere by making commonplace sounds frightening. For instance, you\u2019ll reach a dead end and will hear keys dangling from someone\u2019s approaching pace through a rotten locked door blocked with wood planks \u2013 or you\u2019ll hear like something is cracking its joints as you turn a corner until the sound evolves into something crushing a child\u2019s skull. I also enjoyed the graphic designs. The two \u201cmonsters\u201d that you face were horrific and the jump scares are off-beat enough for the player to get caught off guard here and there. But they\u2019re not loud, they\u2019re more in the fashion of a \u201cglitch-in-the-matrix\u201d type. \n\nOverall, [b]The Descent[/b] is a fun title that I would not mind if it served as an example to follow. It's slightly above its price range but that's only a minor caveat. It\u2019s one of the better Unity games out there right now and it has the potential to influence the genre like the Slender-Man series. That being said, [b]The Descent[/b] is a Unity title surpasses the expectations laid out by Slender-clones before it by avoiding the trope of collecting items while a tall, ominous silhouette follows you continuously until the end. It doesn\u2019t revolutionize the field of horror-exploration, but it does enough to warrant its own merit within the Unity titles\n\n[h1]If you enjoy the way I review games, consider joining and following my curator group!

It has a solid atmosphere and the puzzles weren't too hard. I finished it in less than an hour and I really took my time with it which probably means that the average person can complete this in less than 30 minutes in its current state. \n\nI encountered a few minor bugs as well. In the hospital waiting room, there is a wall in the men's bathroom stall that goes invisible and you can walk through it. If you click around enough in the waiting room, the mouse pointer appears which can be a little disorienting if you're easily motion sick like me. I found that this can be fixed by hitting escape and then resuming the game. \n\nI didn't find there to be many scares outside of a small handful of jump scares. I think only one of them actually made me jump. But I play a LOT of horror games so that might be because I'm a veteran. :P\n\nOnce I got to the ending, I was greeted by a 'To be continued' sort of screen. I guess that means that there are more chapters coming? Hopefully they don't charge for them since the first 'chapter' isn't worth $3.99 just by itself. \n\nKeep it up Devs!

So I am assuming there will be more additions to it at a later time. VERY SHORT.  So far I'm giving it 6/10 mainly because I cant complain with the price.

Now if you watched my above gameplay footage, you might be confused as to why, as it seems like I am enjoying the game. And in fact yes, I did enjoy it. However there are a number of issues the game suffers from.\n\nFirst is just how damn short it is. My playtime includes me having to redo the section you see in my video impression. Yes the game is that short, and offers little replayability. It also ends on a to be continued - but no indication if the extra chapters will be free or paid for. \n\nAlso the controls are somewhat laggy, as well, with some odd choices such as using E and Q to flip switches.\n\nAnd talknig of switch flippping the storepage suggests puzzle elements? Flicking switches does not equate to puzzles. But that was the one 'puzzle' in the game. \n\nThe game also suffers from poor pacing. Some sections you are stuck just waiting for things to happen, or for picture elements to appear. That is not good game design. \n\nSo why have i not refunded the game and left a negative review? \n\nBecause this developer does show some promise. He (or she) has some good ideas, and some moments in game are really disorienting and the jump scares are kept to a minimum. He also attmepts to break the gameplay up, as well as having put in the effort at some cutscens and into to tie the game together. Something you don't often see in most untiy horror games on steam.\n\nThe basic seed is there, but it need more time to grow before harvesting. So hopefully the dev will take this onboard and get out a conclusion to this game, and remove the irritations that are holding it back from being a much better game.", "recommendationid": "33980180", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495847", "timestamp_created": 1501711102, "author": {"num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 1203, "playtime_forever": 67, "last_played": 1501707647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989290281"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501907188, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 6, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "review": "pretty gud 9/11 butt not enough eggplant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "recommendationid": "34030119", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482323", "timestamp_created": 1501907188, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_forever": 106, "last_played": 1501907124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198282590978"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501689046, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 10, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Sets the horror tones quite well.\nManages the slow build and utilizes environmental scares and organically revealed areas to add tension.\nPuzzles are fairly simple, but you get to walk through the ever evolving landscape of shadowy figures, ashen bodied ghouls and locked, electorcuting doors.\nI am terrible at these games but I can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the game.\nCheck it out.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AC4PqAMr9_I", "recommendationid": "33973737", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471545", "timestamp_created": 1501689046, "author": {"num_reviews": 396, "num_games_owned": 538, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1501682260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019816374"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501679981, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 12, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "This game awesome in general!
