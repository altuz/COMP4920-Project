Fun. Super hard. Frustrating. Impossible? Delightful -- when you finally beat the level after 150 deaths!\n\nThis is a crazy game with a very original graphic style and a pretty good level design. Everything is placed and timed in a pixel and millisecond perfect manner to force you to find the right timing to run, walk, jump, warp, die and warp again...\nAnd it definitely does not feel random - when you finally beat a section of the level, it's because you understood the physics, the right timing, and it's very rewarding.\n\nEven though some of the graphics could use a bit more polish (e.g. the fonts, or the color palette), don't let them put you off. This is a really fun game and well worth its price.\n\nNote: At the time of its release the controls were quite frustrating, with lack of mid-air control making the game harder than it ought to be. This way quickly improved based on player feedback, the developer is very responsive and obviously put a lot of love in this game.", "recommendationid": "35159712", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1506188452, "author": {"num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1283, "playtime_forever": 121, "last_played": 1506269394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "steamid": "76561198025247656"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "3 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 3, "total_positive": 3, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
