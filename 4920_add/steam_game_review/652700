I'm not sure why so few people have expressed their enjoyment of it, the only complaint I have is that it wasn't nearly long enough.\n\nCan you find a way to apply the Socratic method to the concepts of good & evil? That's effectively what this story will test you on. Somehow through adorable anthropomorphic animals and magic tricks. \n\nThe game itself is a visual novel, it isn't entirely kinetic but the choices feel like they have a pretty minimal impact on the games' outcome. There are multiple endings to strive for, but the endings themselves have very little content with most of the story being static & unchangeable. That's something I personally don't mind but may be offputting to some. \n\nThat said I really felt that the story was great and the characters were compelling. Even the minor characters felt like they had a good deal of thought put into their design and dialogue. And the major characters are... full of surprises. It is short but it's also $2 and, in my opinion, entirely worth it even if you only plan to play through it once.", "recommendationid": "35065886", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "timestamp_created": 1505832731, "author": {"num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 296, "playtime_forever": 80, "last_played": 1505790396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049203025"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "6 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 6, "total_positive": 6, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
