While it could use some fine tuning on the gunplay and jumping mechanics to make it more interesting/intuitive/immersive, overall this game is good. no major bugs.  there are silly things like crawlers dying on the side of buildings, sticking there, and the pistol being difficult to single fire - also there are no stats on the guns to tell which one is best (the aug seems like it), and you cant seemingly drop guns or have them on different keys - would be nice. \n\noverall, good, promising, especially for the money.", "recommendationid": "33381869", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500943", "timestamp_created": 1499537877, "author": {"num_reviews": 128, "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_forever": 91, "last_played": 1503200707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001807994"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1499574391, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 3, "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 1, "review": "Picked it up while it was cheap, and holy crap is it good.\nIt runs flawlessy on my potato pc and everything is quite fluid.
