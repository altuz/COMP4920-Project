SO MANY RANDOM MONSTER BATTLES OH MY GOD. They are less common in this game and there's a Pokemon-esque item that keeps monsters away for a bit. Inexpensive to buy in the shop and makes my life so much better. Even better, once you've played a bit, it gets BETTER. Eventually you will receive an item that allows you to turn off random encounters until you wanna turn them back on. Amazing. Perfect. Wonderful. Yes. This makes me particularly happy because there are a lot of fun hidden things in the big world and it's nice to be able to go looking for them without having to go through all those encounters!! (I would say, definitely turn encounters back on enough to level up, but it's amazing to have the choice.)\n\n2. If you stop playing for too long and don't take copious notes while playing, you'll come back and have no idea what you were doing. Sojouner gives you a fun Telepathy Ring to contact the queen at any time to remind you about what you were trying to do. I haven't had this issue anyway because I have been binge-playing this because it is a load of fun and not so frustrating (thanks largely to the ability to turn off encounters when I don't feel like battling a load)... so I guess that's another feature that helps with that issue!\n\nI'm at the very end of the game (I'm pretty sure) and have played for about 13.3 hours total (not in one go). I feel like there's a bit more to be done and this boss battle is kicking my butt, BUT when I get frustrated with that, I can go on a fun SOJOURN (heheh) to another place to train up, explore, do a side quest, and/or get more fun items. \n\nI used to (and really still do) love those old RPGs, but they really did frustrate me so much. Sojourner fixes a lot of what frustrated me while lovingly poking fun at the flaws and quirks of old games. It has some really lovely messages put in, loads of fun extras to find, and a wonderful sense of humour. Plus it's only $4.99, y'all! You can't beat that pricing! Seriously though, you guys should play this thing.", "recommendationid": "33666851", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503892", "timestamp_created": 1500535173, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_forever": 1739, "last_played": 1500862221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198274001236"}, "votes_up": 4}, {"timestamp_updated": 1500609901, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've been playing all evening, and it's a lot of fun. I love the little self-deprecating jokes scattered all over. It's like the \"Lost Skeleton of Cadavra\" of the 8-bit RPG world. I really appreciate the \"Auto\" mode for combat -- I was never into the combats -- but for those who actually enjoy the combat mechanics, you can do that to your heart's content. I also appreciate the \"optimize\" on the equipment page -- though, again, for those who enjoy the \"housekeeping\" stuff, have at it. (I wish there was an optimize that would work on all your characters at the same time). You can have up to 8 in your adventuring group, though only 4 are in action at a time.  \n\nI totally recommend this for all who love the old RPGs.
