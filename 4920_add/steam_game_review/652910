It's basically superhot but 2d, and is only $2. (I bought it on sale for $1.79) Delay has 56 levels and 10 challenges. The only thing I wish was added to this game was the option turn off the sound, it gets a little annoying when listening to music becuase of how loud it is. Other than that I love the game.", "recommendationid": "32453198", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510677", "timestamp_created": 1497560417, "author": {"num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_forever": 232, "last_played": 1501859619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198233293064"}, "votes_up": 6}, {"timestamp_updated": 1497823139, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 4, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Really neat little game. 2D shooter with lots of strategy", "recommendationid": "32550921", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499247", "timestamp_created": 1497823139, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 531, "playtime_forever": 123, "last_played": 1497823109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007966690"}, "votes_up": 3}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 2, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
