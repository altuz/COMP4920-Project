It's by far the best 2D platformer I've played since Super Meat Boy, it's challenging but the replay system let's you learn from other players, you will stare in awe as the top scorer clears a level faster than Sonic ejaculates, and you will want to imitate him, you will try again and again, getting a little bit better each time. Eventually you will be able to finish the game with a perfect score and a decent time, even though your place in the scoreboard is still relatively bad, you earned that goddamn place, dammit! And you are proud!\nThe game also has a fantastic soundtrack and characters with very charming designs and animations, always wanted to be an anime ninja janitor."}]}
