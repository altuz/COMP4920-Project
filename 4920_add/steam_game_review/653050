No instructions at the beginning and you dont get smooth from one Scene to another. Sometimes you have to click several times to get back to the map view. The events in this game are kinda unbalanced. I began a game and 3 sec after an event occured, saying I have lost the game because my reputation was too bad. In my opinion, this game has also no mechanic that makes it really interesting. You just click around at the beginning, not knowing what to do and when you finally get it, it is not hard to play/ get money. The most boring part is the waiting for customers, because you really have nothing to do while waiting. Sometimes a bird crosses the screen and you can click on it for 5 bucks. I tried watching a movie while playing but when a customer waits too long, he disappears or gives you no reputation.", "recommendationid": "34037735", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519633", "timestamp_created": 1501938204, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 82, "playtime_forever": 66, "last_played": 1501869435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198039788791"}, "votes_up": 12}, {"timestamp_updated": 1501827813, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 2, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "i like sim games. i really want to like this game. the concept appeals to me. however, in the 28 minutes i played, i failed twice and restarted probably 15-20 times trying to get a secretary, so i could actually see what the clients wanted.  some basic instructions on first start up would be nice. i'm not really a fan of guessing what i'm supposed to be doing, and \"click on everything\", explains nothing. if $9 isnt a big deal, go ahead and try it. judge for yourself. opinions vary and some people like a little frustration in their games. if you're on a budget, or have little patience, i'd suggest a different game, or waiting until the mechanics in this one are a little more refined. i'm gonna give it a thumbs up. its a new game, from, i'm guessing, a newish developer. i have no desire to stifle growth and inovation with negativity. it just wasnt my cup of tea.", "recommendationid": "34009403", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514895", "timestamp_created": 1501827813, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 28, "playtime_forever": 28, "last_played": 1501826046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049958098"}, "votes_up": 8}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 2, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
