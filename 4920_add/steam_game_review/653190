But a lot of fun! I tried playing it both on my own, and with my girlfriend. I'm not sure which is more difficult - trying to control both of the astronauts on your own requires a lot of attention dividing, but playing it with a partner requires good communication and co-operation.\n\nThe game is pretty brutal and throws hazards at you from the very first level. It's one thing figuring out how to get through a particular level, and an entirely separate challenge successfully coordinating the astronauts to accomplish whatever needs to be done. But when you do finally finish a level, it's very rewarding and makes you want to get straight into tackling what's next.\n\nIt's frustrating yet challenging game and I'd recommend it to any experienced player that's looking for something more demanding. A good one to play over a lunch hour at work with a colleague.", "recommendationid": "34835163", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "timestamp_created": 1504956677, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 29, "playtime_forever": 90, "last_played": 1504815141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051426590"}, "votes_up": 5}, {"timestamp_updated": 1504884752, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Great indie game!
