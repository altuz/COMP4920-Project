Secondly, you may be able to solve the fullscreen issue by right-clicking on the window and going to properties. You will be able to select an option to start in fullscreen.\nAs for the crashes, I'm not sure what's causing this issue. I have tested the game and have never experienced a crash, but will see if the problem is indeed on my end and an update will be released shortly.\nThanks again,\nR", "review": "I recommend this game for one reason, it has potential. It seems a good story with good music and an old school feel. But it crashes a lot, and i've yet to get past the first chapter because of the shut downs. Also, there seems to be no way of full screening it, though that may be my own error. For being a two dollar game, i think it is totally worth being patient for. It really seems like, if it actually worked, the game would be totally worth playing if only to hear the story out.", "recommendationid": "33493463", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510542", "timestamp_created": 1499912206, "author": {"num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 23, "playtime_forever": 40, "last_played": 1499912254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035686617"}, "votes_up": 5}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 1, "total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0}, "success": 1}
