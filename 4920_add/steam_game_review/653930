Despite it being fantastic fun though and fairly (will elaborate for improvements) easy to use, it definitely does not feel complete, but fortunately with the recent workshop update it seems the dev cares about user feedback and is willing to implement features and changes so that bodes well for the future. \nWhile I definitely haven't played enough to exhaust the content by any sense of the imagination, I have definitely found myself wishing for a few things on multiple occasions which I feel like should be prioritised for updates in order to maximise the experience:\n- Some kind of raised scenery or ability to build up to create edges to a scene so your photos don't just seem to drop off the edge (it looks really weird if you're trying to take a photo of something) - just needs something like hills or sloped ground and that would do the trick i reckon. \n- Dogs and cats/domesticated animals other than farm ones would be great for city scenes in particular (dog walkers etc to add an extra element of variety to scenes)\n- Just a bunch of normal people as the large majority of the people models here are all different and somewhat out there which is great for making the main character for an event, but it seems to lack models suitable for bystanders/spectators which definitely add an extra element to your little cities. \n- Some of the textures (particularly for the racetracks) are slightly inconsistent in the way they seem to be put together, with some types of textures having more size options than others for some reason which is more weird and annoying than a lacking feature but something to be rectified nonetheless.\n- Particle effects of some description would be incredible and totally bring scenes to life (smoke, fire, dirt, sparks etc) especially for scenes containing cars as it is hard to create a sense of movement or speed or collision without tyre smoke or sparks from a crash etc. \n- Can't seem to find a microphone too which is obviously a tiny thing but was annoying when trying to pose my reporter in one of my scenes. \n- Definitely could do with some kind of \"pick block\" option - similar to middle mouse click on minecraft - was thinking maybe the grip buttons for vive, as I have found myself wanting this on many occasions.\n- Inventory is super, super cluttered. Maybe for similar objects (different skins of the same object), give only one object in the inventory and then let us select which variety on an options panel or something if we do the trigger-touchpad click thing like for moving a character's limbs. Just a suggestion for implementation but the inventory definitely needs to be cleaned up if there are going to be more models. \n\nUltimately this is a really really cool vr experience and I can see it transforming into something with thousands and thousands of objects, where characters can be customised in a simplified hat-hair-skin-clothes-shoes slider style menu where the possibilities for creating amazing scenes are endless.", "recommendationid": "34779284", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507515", "timestamp_created": 1504717184, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 130, "playtime_forever": 249, "last_played": 1504708238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198089360252"}, "votes_up": 3}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506461400, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "review": "ADD STEAM WORKSHOP PLEASE but great game", "recommendationid": "35230679", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "timestamp_created": 1506461400, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_forever": 364, "last_played": 1507152462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 364, "steamid": "76561198153517850"}, "votes_up": 2}, {"timestamp_updated": 1506280572, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I own over 1k plus steam games and this is my 3rd review ever......why did I review it then!!!!!!!   Because the devs of this title deserve some respect for putting this together.  Firstly it's different to any other thing I've tried.  It is not game.  DONOT buy this if you think its a game because its not, not in the usual sence anyway.......SO WHAT IS IT??  It's a little bit of genius written in code is what it is.\n\nIt's a giant lego design board in front of you.  Create a town, decorate it, walk around it, destroy it, rebuild it and admire it.  It's for people who are too old to play lego but still have a desire to do so.  Do it in your own private dwellings and play god and love the software.
