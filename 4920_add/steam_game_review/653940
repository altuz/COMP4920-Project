The game is basically the same as the prequel, but with more events and some better looking menus/ more customization. This is basically a standalone dlc for the first game.  \n\nThey do have a new, really cool customization system which may be fun for some, you can create your own characters, background stories/ careers, groups, weapons, gear and other items, but I feel like with this system they could've added more item diversity in the game,  expect to see mostly the same stuff from the original: crossbows, bats, wooden spoons, etc. \n\nMaybe if they added a steam workshop  for mods it'd add more playability.", "recommendationid": "35078900", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_created": 1505890334, "author": {"num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 205, "playtime_forever": 70, "last_played": 1505888496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059637166"}, "votes_up": 1}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_negative": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "total_reviews": 39, "total_positive": 31, "review_score": 6}, "success": 1}
