I played the NES version and Archon Ultra for MS-DOS, always guessing how cool would it be if\u2026 no matter what, Archon Classic will satisfy your inner and deepest desires.\n\nThis is a chess-like game where pieces of Light and Dark fight each other in real-time battles. Of course, most of the game\u2019s strategy is on the board, where the turn-based portion takes place. If you\u2019re a regular chess player, you\u2019ll probably start thinking about openings, forks, movement block, waste of time, zugzwang and other well-known elements of chess.\n\nIf you just want to finish the game, there\u2019re four campaigns with 15 missions each that won\u2019t take too long to beat; one or two weekends would be enough to go through all the missions. If you like to unlock every achievement and complete 100% of game, know that Archon Classic will keep yourself busy no matter how skilled you are.\n\nEach campaign level has three rankings (bronze, silver and gold), and it\u2019s possible to replay all the maps with the Insane difficulty, not to mention the possibility to turn on the secondary fire mode, which adds a little more depth in the real-time battles.\n\nKeep in mind that there isn\u2019t online multiplayer, which is a shame considering that it\u2019s possible to play with one or more friends on the same computer. Good luck, however, to find someone that comes to your house just to play Archon Classic in hot seat mode. I managed to twist my son\u2019s mind and convinced him to play with me as an ally, and it was really cool beating the forces of the darkness in teamed up battles.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I would recommend Archon Classic to players that never played or heard about Archon before. This is really a game dedicated to longtime fans. Every cool aspect of the previews titles is present here. Things that old Archon fans used to do, like beating the computer as fast as possible or killing his entire army with the weakest piece is funnier than ever, especially because most of these insanities are now part of the campaign."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1450941408, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500749", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "19899545", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197963287854", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1358582400, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 27}, "timestamp_updated": 1450941408, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A nice update of the 80s original.

There is also the ability to play on different maps some are dependant upon the number of players.
