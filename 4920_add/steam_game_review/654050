Now to be clear it is not as good as [i]Neon Chrome[/i], but that's ok. [i]Neon Chrome[/i] has nearly infinite replayability due to proc gen, and [i]JYDGE[/i] has premade levels (I will not use the term 'hand crafted'). The rogueish factor in [i]Neon Chrome[/i] also gave it serious hooks for addicting gameplay.\n\nBut yeah, [i]JYDGE[/i] is solid and does its own thing pretty well. \n\nI like the mission structure and the tons of really cool unlockables and gear. 10Tons has shown they are really good at coming up with cool and novel mechanics, and now they have also shown us that they understand how to hide grind. That's a fantastic skill to have when developing games. \n\nBut on a very serious note - and moving forward - please, no more [i]Neon Chrome[/i] look-alikes. I [i]know[/i] that [i]Time Recoil[/i] had its own angle and so does [i]JYDGE[/i], but the whole 'feel' begins to wear thin at some point. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Great functional unlockables and gear to customize your dude\n+There is some pretty great subtle humor\n+I like the mission structure\n+The price point is right\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-I think this would have done better with proc gen levels; the premade levels aren't anything super special (have the levels generate once per save, so mission 1 is always the same BUT was randomly generated that once)\n-I want those feels back from last summer when I was super addicted to [i]Neon Chrome[/i], and both [i]JYDGE[/i] and [i]Time Recoil[/i] sort of tease with that but don't deliver on that level (and that's ok, but it's true)\n\n[b]Get [i]Neon Chrome[/i] first, but then get [i]JYDGE[/i].[/b]", "recommendationid": "35476479", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555976", "timestamp_created": 1507137437, "author": {"num_reviews": 618, "num_games_owned": 1196, "playtime_forever": 153, "last_played": 1507159196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "steamid": "76561198040884867"}, "votes_up": 35}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507147429, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "I've played this game 8 levels so far and it's hard to stop playing.\n\nWhat I like\n+ It's easy to get in but hard to master\n+ playability is excellent\n+ It's fun to try to meet all level goals\n+ Jydge customization possibilities\n+ Level design is interesting\n+ Music varies a lot and it is good\n\nWhat I don't like\n- some graphic are quite simple\n\nI really recomended this game if you like to have a enjoyable shooter with a twist of 80's and cyberpunk twist.", "recommendationid": "35479597", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "timestamp_created": 1507147429, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_forever": 257, "last_played": 1507147028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 257, "steamid": "76561198099354722"}, "votes_up": 7}, {"timestamp_updated": 1507153464, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "review": "PROs\n* Well, it's fun\n* Decent amount of content\n* You can set up your perks and your equipment for each level separately\n\nCONs\n* Well, it's gets tough, especially if you want to speedrun.

It's set in the same universe, and call it a standalone expansion if you will but it plays and flows very differently and the changes are all good. If you have played Neon Chrome you will get the basic skeleton of what is going on, but the way you tackle the game and the way you progress is totally different.\n\nIt does have replayability in the sense there are medals for each mission and because it's not procedurally generated you can improve on your attempt each time or just plan to focus on one of the harder medals and get the rest later. Medals are awarded for things like \"save all hostages\" or \"get in and out in 20 seconds\". Medals are used to unlock implants for the JYDGE and upgrades for the Gavel(his gun) and the more you unlock the more creative you can get with your loadout. After I beat ACT 1 it unlocked a hardcore mode that I could replay the missions with for more medals and more upgrades. So that's what I did, beat the first act and then started on it again and quite happily.\n\nYou could really specialise for a particular medal if you liked. Because there are no random elements, and along with your character, the gun has multiple perk slots and the volume and variety of perks, I can see great things ahead.\n\nThe music is excellent, more dynamic and aggressive, which really helps when you are able to walk through most of the props you had to shoot or melee in Neon Chrome. Windows? Just walk through them. Thinner walls? just walk through them.\n\nI'm entirely delighted with JYDGE.
