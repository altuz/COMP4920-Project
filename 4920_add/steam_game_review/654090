[b]I was surprised that this game worked perfectly fine with standing room only using only 2 sensors with the Oculus Rift and touch controllers.[/b]  The dev really needs to add Oculus Rift support in the store description  \n\nI will definitely have to try room scale.  But even at standing room only this game was fun to play.  That's because of the VR environments, the avatars, the controls were all superb.  I had no problems with tracking and the gameplay was superfast and addicting.  In fact, the only problem I had was with the VR mini-games included.  But since I only had standing room space only, I can't say it's anything wrong with the game.  \n\nI have not tried multi-player.  Even on easy on single player, the game was quite challenging for a noob like me to Badminton.  \n\nRating 8/10 .. definitely a must buy at the current sale price of $9.99, lot of bang for your buck here, especially if you have a friend to PvP with", "recommendationid": "34895889", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "timestamp_created": 1505196950, "author": {"num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "playtime_forever": 17, "last_played": 1505197090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240"}, "votes_up": 1}, {"timestamp_updated": 1505180507, "language": "english", "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "review": "Really not a bad game at all. Shuttle physics are pretty good (better than expected) and skill level range is pretty good too of the AI. Not played Multiplayer yet, but Single & the Fun modes are good.\n\n**Word of advice** - switch to 'teleport' movement method in the Options. It will help you not get sick.\n\nThe only real issue I really had, was a full-speed smash wasnt tracked very well. This is more likely a Vive tracking problem however due to the sheer speed of a real-life smash. There were a few glitches, but nothing game breaking. Has otherwise a nice level of polish. I would like to see some different rackets, & more AI players with diverse skin tones, but that's just cosmetic. Devs seem pretty active too which is great :)\n\nOverall, pretty impressed for the money. B+ or 4 out of 5. \n", "recommendationid": "34893377", "steam_purchase": true, "voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502150", "timestamp_created": 1505180507, "author": {"num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 637, "playtime_forever": 736, "last_played": 1507205693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 446, "steamid": "76561197960294884"}, "votes_up": 2}], "query_summary": {"review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_negative": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "total_reviews": 18, "total_positive": 15, "review_score": 7}, "success": 1}
