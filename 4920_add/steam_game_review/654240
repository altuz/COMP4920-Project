The reason I don't like the game is because it's badly designed.\n\nGood things to note are the game is very generous with its extend, where 1ups are simply item drops. The game drops 3 and more of them per stage. Plus, with correct settings, the game can manage to keep its 60 FPS. The lack of Vertical mode for display is disappointing, however. But it can't be helped. The game doesn't have any Replay or any sort, but the game lets you Stage Practice. Not too bad.\n\nThe root of problem for this game is the Stage design and the ship itself. For one, the ship is very slow, even without using Focus (Equivalent to Laser Shot in Dodonpachi games). It will be fine if the normal shot itself is very wide, but it isn't. It makes aggressive play unviable. Secondly, the Focus shot itself. It's a lock-on type of shot and oh boy, it's impotent. It's lock-on range is very skewed to the front. the fact that this shot's power is practically the same as its main shot doesn't help, either. Not only that, the game is very stingy with Bombs. The Bomb is a charging type, similar to Ikaruga's homing lasers. But it doesn't fill quickly at all! The game fills bombs quickly with item drops, but one use of Bomb depletes all of the Bombs. That removes your defenses!\n\nThe worst of all, the stage design is bland. Not cinematic, not fast, just bullet spraying with cheap enemy placement that aren't designed for a slow ship. And the bosses are even worse. They're bullet sponges with cheap bullet patterns! Especially the ones with big, long bullets without any warning what so ever! It makes the game a test of memorization. Granted, one of the keys to 1cc shmups is memorization, but making the patterns cheaply kill you is simply not fun.\n\nThis game is competent as a program. It's stable, it's playable, and it doesn't crash. But might as well as playing this game as an example of how to make a badly designed shmup.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502256782, "timestamp_created": 1502256688, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198101866876", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 30, "last_played": 1502255547, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
