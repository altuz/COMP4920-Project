There are some microtransaction-esque mechanics but they seem to have been removed/changed for a one-time purchase model, but time will tell how well the balancing has been done on that.\n\nThe gameplay has hints of roguelike-ness to it as well - you attack/move, enemies attack/move, but your movement is restricted to tiles of the same type, which also then generate money, energy, health, etc. It's a cute subtle nuance that does a decent job of kinda combining genres without hamfisting - too often you see matching games crammed into other realms where they kinda work but don't really fit or make sense in some ways.\n\nThe art style is pretty cohesive - a little grungy for pixel but still not bad at all, pretty good aesthetic. The 30FPS lock is a little annoying just for visual niceness for being used to a 144hz monitor, the mouse movement and animation seem a smidge clunky, but it's because of that more than anything else, I'm sure. Makes the game feel a tiny bit slow to respond - a minor complaint.\n\nEdit: Well, so much for that, maybe? I got full stars on the first 4 maps except for #3, the last star requires to \"deal X damage with magic.\" Magic costs 6k though, and I only have 2k. There are no new levels opened and I can't go to the next area yet, and access to levels seems to be based on stars, so I guess I *HAVE* to get the last start.. which I guess means I just have to grind out gathering gold from the screen one at a time from 2k up to 6k, orrrr..? I dunno. Seems like maybe they need to tighten up the rebalance and progressing after removing microtransactions to make progression fun and smooth and not a stonewall'd grind.\n\nSorry devs, total game killer right there. Was kinda cute/fun, but having done all stars I can up to 4 on the first area I'm totally stuck without just grinding out gold tiles.. not gonna do that. I assume i the mobile version this would prompt people to buy gold instead of actually play the game. I appreciate the attempt to shift to a one-time purchase model, but I think y'all missed the mark a bit. No new levels have opened up at 23 stars, I beat the boss of 4, and got full stars on all but #3, which requires magic, which costs 6k, soooo.. rather than run around a board and collect gold one at a time up to 6k, I'm gonna play somethin' else and refund.", "votes_down": 11, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506555007, "timestamp_created": 1506552459, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "steamid": "76561197967981251", "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 380, "last_played": 1506554870, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 21, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35263123", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "review": "Great game.
