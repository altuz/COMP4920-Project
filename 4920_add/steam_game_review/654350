It is pretty faithful in gameplay and it has kickass music that parodies DOOM soundtrack. You can look left/right but not up/down like in the classics of the genre. Unfortunately,  lack of fullscreen and combination of small issues make it a hard sell at the moment.\n\n[b] No Fullscreen at the time of this review [/b]\n\nOnce again I buy a decent game-maker game and I have to play it in a quarter of my monitor. Platforming game could get away with it but FPS really needs a fullscreen. I am legitimately getting a headache because the small size of the window makes it hard to follow where I am. If not for the lack of fullscreen it would be a serviceable game.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nPretty much exactly what you would expect from a DOOM clone.Shoot, move, pick up ammo and open doors with key cards. Simple and yet satisfying. The only big issues for me is that first 4 guns have the same delayed projectile mechanic. Basically dodging and shooting is very inconsistent to a point where I just want to melee everything. Ammo is semi-universal so when you pick it up it only gives ammo for the weapon equipped but each weapon keeps its own magazine.\n\nThere are several enemy types. Similar to DOOM enemies get bigger and harder. Pixel models for enemies and death animations look decent. I find the game a little hard but fair enough. Not sure how long it is because I can't really beat it. For the 8MB game, I'll just say that it is not insultingly short.\n\n[b]Pixel Art & Music[/b]\n\nMusic is made with similar instruments to DOOM soundtrack so I really enjoy it (except main title theme which is completely different) So far each level has its own soundtrack which is nice. Also, I really like that main character is female even though you don't get to look at yourself. I just wish she had a bubble-head in the middle. The design of the stages and wall texture is rather confusing but I do like the overall aesthetic.\n\n[h1]Verdict 5/10 [/h1] ( Can be 7/10 if Developer adds fullscreen and polishes the game a bit ) \n\nOverall I find Cyber Utopia somewhat nostalgic but it really needs Fullscreen to be enjoyed fully.Music is decent and I like the idea of a female DOOM game. Some minor issues here and there but the game is not too far from beeing serviceable.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1497743825, "timestamp_created": 1497738231, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "last_played": 1501106573, "playtime_forever": 269}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
