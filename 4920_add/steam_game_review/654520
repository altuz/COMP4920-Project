Another game.  I appreciate the humor in this one as well.  Still enjoyed everything, including little bits of information presented for you to the side of the level.  This game made me want to travel and watch how it all was back then.  It drew me a world of how it could've been...so many more secrets to uncover...!  Thank you for being peaceful and challenging and making this game. :)))\n\nAchievements don't work on this one either...I pretend I get them though.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503622939, "timestamp_created": 1503622939, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198207083779", "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 125, "last_played": 1505602644, "playtime_forever": 1129}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
