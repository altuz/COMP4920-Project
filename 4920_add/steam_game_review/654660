Short, took 6 hours to beat and 1 was spent out to lunch.

I love the roguelike feel. Basically, all these \"agents\" are getting sent in to a supposedly easy mission to die--and when you die as one character you just take over another character sent by a rival corporation.\n\nI just got through the wall and unlocked all the grid upgrade points. I'm not sure how to best use the grid, though, or whether running power through the same type of node multiple times makes that ability more powerful or something.\n\nI'm starting to figure out when to recycle which parts, so I'm dying less and attacking stuff whose elements I can repair when I counterattack. Don't be afraid to mix up your strategy or experiment. It's a roguelike after all.\n\nI definitely need more information from the UI when it comes to devising my strategy though. At first it seemed like I never got new parts or different elements, but I think that's because I wasn't recycling at all, and it wasn't clear how I was supposed to get those new different parts and elements. I eventually learned, but I got surprisingly far with my starting mono earth element parts.\n\nThe dev is inspired by stuff like FTL, Darkest Dungeon, and XCOM, and it shows--even though gameplay here and level of polish is different from those, you can feel like XCOM, FTL, and DD without playing like them exactly.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504024889, "timestamp_created": 1504024889, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029186485", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 349, "last_played": 1504026080, "playtime_forever": 153}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
