The screen resolution options were confusing and fullscreen wasn't exactly fullscreen. When clicking the option, it showed the game in the center and just black around it rather than an actual fullscreen. The level creator is cool, however it feels clunky and slow. The cartridge loader is awkward, I was looking at the games I was subcribed to, but they didn't appear in the cartridge loader. I really want to like this game because it reminds of playing these kind of games on newgrounds, but for right now there are just too many issues for me.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504190658, "timestamp_created": 1504190658, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043981479", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 63, "last_played": 1504641523, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34628201", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484260", "review": "there is no level to play!", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504164529, "timestamp_created": 1504164529, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198206186723", "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 219, "last_played": 1504164438, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
