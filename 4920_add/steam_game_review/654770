It's a simple point and click puzzle game. You only need your mouse. A simple goal of getting the ball marked with an \"X\" to the green zone using explosive red blocks to push the blue blocks. It emphasizes timing and trial and error, but is not too exasperating to new players. The music was calm and relaxing, and the controls are fine. For $0.99, this is a fine game to pass the time. I didn't really take long to finish it, but then again, it's just a buck. Then again, there are some details that could make this game better, like achievements and trading cards, and changing it so that if you lose a level, you don't have to manually restart it but can just automatically try it again. Overall, I'd recommend this game.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501688209, "timestamp_created": 1501688209, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198075111467", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 58, "last_played": 1501824839, "playtime_forever": 39}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34007028", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Completed in about 1 hour nice.
