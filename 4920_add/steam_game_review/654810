The snake behavior and the eggs concept have been kept. You help a Brown Water Snake to reach the hole of each level to his long journey. (Well if you are a snake specialist you can tell me if that's a Brown Water Snake but it seems to be one.) Several gameplay mechanisms are added to the game : snakes with different behavior, eggs and buttons.\n\n[h1]- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u] \nGraphics are nice despite they are minimalistic : they look like 3D models. And the 5 worlds as well as the 7 snakes will not let you bored. Only the levels overview is the less attractive part of the game.\n http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1062951187\n\n[u][b]Sounds, Music[/b][/u] \nNice music with fine sounds.\n\n[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u] \nYou begin with the map with overview of the unlocked levels : only one at the beginning. As long as you clear a puzzle you unlock the adjacent ones. This is a really nice concept as you can skip or play any unlocked level you want. Also the title of each level can provide a precious hint on how to solve it.\nTo clear a puzzle you need to move the brown water snake to its destination : the black hole. There are no time or \"step\" limits and you can use the Undo and Restart features whenever you want.\nYou can move any snake you want in any order, just be sure to not get a snake stuck unless you need to do it. Anyway you can always use the Undo or Restart feature at any time. Also you will encounter mostly 3 unique snakes which make the game tougher.\nAdding to that you will encounter some eggs in several levels : the regular one and the black one. As you may think the regular will increase the size of any snake by one tile. I say any because it's not mandatory that your snake eat it as some puzzles requires you to have another snake that eat the egg. And the black eggs are rotten eggs so it will decrease the length of a snake by one tile but if the snake is already small he will die and disappears from the level.\nFinally you will encounter some buttons - switches that all need to be pressed in order to open the hole.\nThe first levels are obvious to clear : they are small, easy and includes a few gameplay mechanisms : including snakes, eggs or buttons.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1062980086\nThe later levels can become a bit tedious as they are medium-sized and sometimes includes several gameplay features.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1062991567\nFinally after you beat all the regular levels you unlock the final level which includes most of the snakes and gameplay features you have previously seen.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1062972034\n\n[u][b]Achievements[/b][/u] \nThere is only one achievement you get after you beat the game.\n\n[h1]---------------------You want more ?---------------------[/h1]\n[h1]Index of Snakes[/h1]\nhttp://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/moved_herpetology/snakes%20and%20lizards/legless%20lizards/legless_lizards.htm\n\n[h1]Steam Curator page[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/M123-GR\n\n[h1]Steam Curator Store Page[/h1]\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/29521492/\n\n[h1]Reviews Sorted by Genres[/h1]\n[b]Work In Progress[/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=964304642", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500201212, "timestamp_created": 1500201157, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198080724645", "num_reviews": 80, "num_games_owned": 2634, "last_played": 1499445823, "playtime_forever": 148}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34090202", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Cute little puzzler.
