Easy to get 100%, only takes a few hours. \n\nPros:\n- Fun levels, easy to learn mechanics.\n- 100% in almost 2 hours.\n- Level design is on point.\n\nCons:\n- Holy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it only has one music track that loops over and over again.\n- The hints really don't help as you get further, as it just shows you the first step and nothing else.\n- If you don't get help with the hints, you're really just stuck and have to grind until you figure it out (intended or otherwise).\n\nOverall, 6/10. After the music loops once, mute it.

Why you may ask ?\nSimple anwser:\nTo achieve and complete the game at the same time it only took me 1 hour and a half. Short explained.\nNow the enteraining part. The Game offers you a simple but good usable method to solve the puzzles. You just need to draw the solution. Which works great in any situation. Important here is that the game should not have any kind of bugs disregarding this feature. I only got a problem once in one of the end levels. But hey i found a funny solution even greater then that one that has been shown as advice from the helper.\n\nWe should not only talk positive about  this game:\nSadly this game throw away its true potential. You only can stuck to 100 levels afterward there is nothing. No Editor for harder community maps, no DLC, no update. And that makes me sad.\n\nFor a short challenging fun i recommend to buy this game for an actuall good price.
