The mix of clever and outlandish is amazing. The only thing that MIGHT be unintentionally funny is some of the voice acting (particularly the character of Robert), but I feel that might be a subtle jab at the \"sexy\" voice acting in bad, stereotypical dating sims. \n\nIt also has a lot of heart. The artwork is great and while the look of your avatar may spoil the mood a bit (even if you try and make them look normal---which I actually suggest you do the first time you play), it's still a really touching story that definitely squeezed several good tears out of me on multiple moments during my first playthrough. Despite being a dating sim, it's mostly about a relationship between a father and his daughter. I won't spoil it for you, but as someone who is closer to my father than anyone else in the world, this got me pretty emotional.\n\nThe music is pretty cool too. Even though I've tried like 10 times to beat one of the minigames, the music is so catchy that I still don't turn the sound off.\n\nMy only real critique that I can think of right now is that I wish the voice acting was a tiny bit less repetitive. That's something they really can't change, so I'm not going to comment on the the very tiny bugs because the developers can patch that up.\n\n                                                           [[TL;DR REVIEW DONE]]\n\n[b]TIPS:[/b]\n[olist]\n    [*]Go on two dates with ALL dads on your first playthrough before picking one.\n    [*]Try to make your avatar look normal-ish for your first playthrough.\n    [*]Save regularly, especially before minigames.\n    [*]Wait a little bit to go on a date with Joseph.\n\n[b]SCORE[/b]\n95% (for folks into/used to dating sims) \n85% (for folks [i]not[/i] into/used to dating sims)", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504984945, "timestamp_created": 1504984908, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "steamid": "76561198420298242", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "last_played": 1506039748, "playtime_forever": 1749}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34882094", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516915", "review": "Great visual romance game/simulator.

The first is that I adore Game Grumps (specifically Arin and Dan), and that they've had nothing to do with the development of the game save for some voicing-- which is really just grunts and 'ah!'s, and some marketing on their channel. The fact that the Grumps' name is on this shouldn't really be taken into account. The second is that I bought it pretty much the day of release and had been following it since it'd been announced. Not as actively as some people, but I knew about all the dads.\n\nI'm going to be starting with the negatives-- frankly, the game itself isn't *really* the issue here. It's the developers.\n\nThe developers have been a little shady from day one. Originally, I was unsure if this game was meant to be a joke, like a lot of other people first suspected-- I'm a queer man, so I was hesitant at first. I think it's important to note that I DID read several posts online about how someone close to the dev team had played the beta and got the impression that this was a grab at Representation Points(tm) and that it was just a cash grab--[url=http://yollgraveyard.tumblr.com/post/162960778784/okay-sorry-for-the-vaguepostsmore-so-yeah] here's the post. [/url] During the release delay, the devs were suspiciously quiet-- they apologized afterwards, but it was still super unprofessional.\n\nI also vaguely remember the devs promising they'd add other dads and extra content, and a few of my friends remember them saying similar. And these two above points are absolutely tied; we're three months out from DD's release date, and the devs have gone silent. Since release, we've gotten two patches-- two bug patches, despite fans asking for more. There's still a bugged achievement that the devs haven't explained, and the second patch was a patch so small that it isn't even mentioned on the Recent Updates section of steam, nor on any of the twitter accounts. [b] The devs have essentially dropped this project as soon as it stopped making money and was no longer in top sellers for the fact that it's a queer dating sim. [/b]\n\nWhich is what a lot of people feared. I feel genuinely ripped off by the developers and the game; if it weren't for the fact that I've got more than 2 hours of this game, which is INCREDIBLY short and lacks any real story arc to tie everyone together, I'd refund it in a heartbeat. This game is almost $20 AUD and yet I wouldn't honestly say it's worth even that much, especially considering a) length and the fact that the game isn't even really complete and b) the devs have abandoned it.\n\nIt's a shame, because otherwise, the game is really pretty and has some great characters; Mat's route is my favourite and the game introduced me to PUP, one of my favourite bands now. It's diverse and cute and I love the fact that you can make a trans dad (even if the CC is godawful compared to character art), BUT the fact that you can now tell that it absolutely was a cash grab destroys it all, and [b] I wouldn't recommend buying [/b] this game to anyone because of it.", "votes_down": 9, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506775303, "timestamp_created": 1506774493, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198147125534", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 57, "last_played": 1501403039, "playtime_forever": 927}, "votes_up": 15, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34923223", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507533", "review": "I LOVE this game!

You're stuck with a very specific kind of character and it would've been nice to have more control over the personality.\nThe music volume is inconsistent. Not a massive issue but in some places the sounds are really loud and in others they're very quiet.\nThere are a lot of typos/grammatical errors in the dialogue.
