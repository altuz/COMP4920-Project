I've had it on my wishlist for months and excitedly bought it the moment it finally came out. This game would be a bargain at twice the price and I feel I already got my money's worth in my first gaming session alone. According to the opening credits sequence, the whole Sun family pitched in to help make this game, which I thought was a nice touch. \n\nThere's 7 regions of puzzles and you have to solve a certain amount of puzzles in each region to unlock the next. Each zone has a new concept that introduces a little more complexity. The gameplay is relatively simple: you can move freely in 3 directions (provided there's ground there) or anchor yourself at one of the 3 tips of your pyramid and swing in an arc along the other two directions. This gives you a surprising range of options, even on a very small level. The goal is to use anchored swings to push other colored pyramids onto tiles of the same color and move your pyramid to the blue tile to finish. It's possible to brute force the earlier levels by just trying everything, but it pays to slow down and get an intuitive sense for how your movement is going to affect the pieces around you.\n\nThis game is nothing like the developer's earlier game, Yankai's Triangle. Triangle is procedurally generated and has very little variety. Yankai's Peak reminds me more of Steven's Sausage Roll, except it has a much smoother learning curve at the beginning. They both involve rotating your character to slide pieces into position and can get very difficult. I heartily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys spacial reasoning puzzles.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500208687, "timestamp_created": 1500208687, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969447988", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 1053, "last_played": 1504673824, "playtime_forever": 321}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33623784", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "review": "They are not kidding about that intro.\n\n(Also, the game is good.
