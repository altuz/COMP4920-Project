This game is early access, and as such, my review may change over time. However, as it stands, I would not recommend this game, unless you plan to get in for the current low price and sit on it until they add more. \n\nCurrently, the game advertises \u201cdozens of tools and parts.\u201d While this is a true statement, it is a bit misleading. As of this writing, the game offers the following build components: 3 structural items, a computer, distance sensor, compass, servo motor, and a wheel for a total of 8 build items. And for programming it has 2 input nodes, 3 output nodes, 9 math operation nodes, and 4 miscellaneous nodes for a total of 18 programming nodes. Overall, this amounts to 27 \u201ctools and parts,\u201d which is indeed dozens, however this isn\u2019t a very extensive list of \u201ctools and parts\u201d for building robots. So there are a very limited number of things you could do with this. To their credit, they are working on adding more content to the game and I am very excited to see this. There are several small bugs and errors you can see in the discussion forums as well, but these aren\u2019t game breaking. So my only issue with this game is really the limited amount of content. \n\nThere are a few, in my opinion, crucial elements missing from this game. There is no programming node for if/then statements or other loops, there are no math functions for inequalities, and there is no way to use Boolean logic. This severely limits your ability to program the robots. I think these things are essential, and if added, I would gladly change my recommendation.\n\nFinally, the tutorial and item (build and programming items) need detailed descriptions. As it is, the input and output values required by some sensors and items are extremely unclear. For example, without reading the discussion board, you would not know that a value of 5000 is the same as a value of 100 for the wheels, as the wheels have a range between 0-100. These items need to have detailed descriptions, and to their credit, they are working on (or maybe have put out by now) a fix for the descriptions, as the developer was notified about this in the discussion.\n\nAs it stands, this game is not worth the price tag. However, it may be worth getting now, as they plan to add more and raise the price as they do. \n\n\nUPDATE: The developer got back to me very quickly regarding the issues I raised in the discussion board. They seem to be on top of things (already implemented some of the smaller fixes) and promised to add more items once the bugs are fixed! Overall, it is looking really good for this game. I still can't change my recommendation at the moment, but as soon as those items are in I would definitely recommend this game!!", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501038611, "timestamp_created": 1501007053, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198101363591", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 94, "last_played": 1501005809, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
