Come back to this game soon and it will probably have earned a thumbs up.\n\nPros:\n\n-The noise you get when you have 3 or more in a row is ridiculously satisfying.\n\n-The \"dark\" theme of the game is an interesting concept.\n\n-I also like the idea of having holes in the board. I have never seen it before - but then again, I don't play too many of these types of games.\n\n-The music is nice. Very nice. It makes me want to work as a receptionist.\n\nCons:\n\n-Uncompressed, the game and its assets are a ridiculous 805 MB. This should not be the case; all the images are low resolution and the music shouldn't be too large. Common Redist is only about 120 MB.\n\n-The game looks too amateur. It feels as if it was made for a school project or something - and in that respect, it's good.\n\n-The level select menu looks messy.\n\n-When playing a level, the text looks messy and out of place.\n\n-The buttons beneath the score are not aligned.\n\n-The icon when running the game is the Unreal logo. \n\n-It runs slowly for a matching game.\n\n-The game doesn't tell you when you're boned. That is, if you can't make a move, the game doesn't let you know.\n\n-All of the buttons look different.\n\nPossible Improvements:\n\n-The game would look much better if the level buttons were placed neatly and looked the same. \n\n-I like the idea of having a \"dark\" themed background image, but please consider having a background that won't make the left side of the screen look messy.\n\n-Instead of using a generic font for the title screen and desktop icon, consider making some custom artwork.\n\n-My biggest recommendation would be to code the game yourself, engine and all. UE4 is great, but you don't want to be giving them 5% of your profits and wasting several MB of space with their engine. It shouldn't be too difficult to code this game if you learn C++ or Java (or something).\n\ntl;dr:\n\nIn my opinion, the game needs some work. The concept is nice, but the implementation needs to be touched up. There are places where the layout appears messy, and the game runs slowly.\n\n(No one reviews like Gaston.)", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499227237, "timestamp_created": 1499227237, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198122980624", "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 65, "last_played": 1499294682, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
