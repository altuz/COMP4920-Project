It's unfair, but for a PS2 classic that you can get for five bucks through sales, I honestly don't really mind. If you buy the game, get to the forums to find a way to make it work properly and you're in for one hell of a party !\n\nAnd this party, you'll be attending it in the shoes of titular protagonist Dante, son of Sparda, as he chases for his twin brother Vergil who decided that making a giant tower spawn in the middle of a town was a pretty cool way to start this game. Except...\nOkay, the tower is cool and all, but you're spending, like, 75% of the game in it, and thedesign really gets boring after a while. And it's not like the artists weren't able to make more diverse environment, the two other areas of the game look gorgeous, but you spend five missions out of twenty in total in those areas. Honestly, this visual poverty better be linked to some great combat.\n\nAnd boy, what a great combat system we have here !\nEach weapon having its own specificities, feeling rough and powerful, lots of enemy types, and a great amount of situations make for one of the most entertaining combat system of all time, and to think so few games managed to create a better combat system in the span of two generations of console speaks plenty of this game's quality.\nExcept...\nI don't really understand the praises behind the style system. It's pretty good, but it's clearly unbalanced. Like, how gunslinger is so OP against normal waves of enemy, but becomes useless against bosses, or how trickster is much more useful than anything else (except maybe later Quicksilver). If only you could switch styles in combat...\nWait.\nStyle switcher mod is the greatest creation of all time. It fixes most issues with the game's port and adds both the possibility to switch styles (at the expenses of having to go through the pause menu to check items, maps, and files, but honestly, who used it ?) but also to switch between all weapons at all times and both new functions are great add-ons that correct the only issues with the game's combat system. Complete with a kick-ass soundtrack and a challenging but never punishing (if you play on gold rather than yellow to add in-level checkpoints) and you get one the most enjoyable experience of the beat'em all genre. And fortunately, enough content to back it up with a 12h campaign, tons of unlockables, a rank system and multiple difficulty levels, this party never ends !    \n\nOne final word maybe ? Yes, only one : jackpot !"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506833405, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35363785", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198307724229", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1498730313, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 60}, "timestamp_updated": 1506833405, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Controller?
