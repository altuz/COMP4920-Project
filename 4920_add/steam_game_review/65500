For starter\u2019s the amazing graphics..  I found myself looking around at all of it in awe! \n\nNice non-irritating somewhat soothing soundtrack.. (Except for an oddly placed barking dog)\nThe storyline in itself is simple.. Get from point A to point B looking for someone..\nTo do this, you as the (Main Character) travel by airship and enter different worlds putting things together on the way. \nThe puzzles ran hot and cold. Some were just thinkable when other\u2019s and a lot for me;  were extremely difficult to impossible! \n\nCons:\nIt has so much frustrating time wasted trying to find a hot spot or even an exit  cursor!  \nThe main character whom you play wasn\u2019t interesting at all and in fact came across as just dumb! \n\nMy biggest beef! I played it way to long for the entire ending to just jump to the credits!!! \nI had to watch the actual ending cut scene on you tube! Grrrrrrrr,,,\n\nIn a nutshell.. If you like a time taker, fantasy, graphics galore and some very challenging puzzle\u2019s you\u2019ll have fun!\n"}]}
