I love board and card games and hoped that this game would be a good addition to my Steam collection. For the price, I'm happy with the purchase.\n\nEach player is trying to build fairy tale style buildings for their city. They do this by pairing building cards they picked up from the center of the board with other buildings in the scrap pile. The points are determined by the point value of the cards, the amount of cards the player is pairing, and the number of similar cards stacked in the scrap pile. Whomever has the most points at the end of the round wins. Specialty cards can be drawn and played to help players accumulate points throughout each round.\n\nUnreal Estate can be played with two to four people. You can play with AI.\n\nPros:\n- Simple mouse controls.\n- Easy to play once you understand the rules and scoring.\n- Rounds are quick.\n- Specialty cards are randomized each round, so there is some variety.\n- Single player AI are some-what challenging but not impossible to beat.\n- Screen is easy to look at throughout play.\n- Cards are easy to read.\n- Audio is pleasant but easily to turn off if you like listening to other things while you play games.\n- Rulebook is always accessible before and during gameplay.\n- Works well on computers that aren't powerful.\n\nCons:\n- No tutorial.\n- No local multiplayer.\n- Because few people know about the game, online multiplayer with strangers is impossible.\n- Not enough variety to maintain one's attention for long periods of time.\n- There is a specialty card that gives you points for all the cards in the scrap pile. Good card. But if you're playing with AI and an AI goes after the card is played, the point counter will cover the card that the AI is playing. It's a momentary cover-up, but it's still a cover-up none-the-less.\n\nFor $2.99, Unreal Estate is a great buy for card game fans. Even if there were no changes made to the game, I could recommend it to people looking for an easy card game to play with others, even AI.\n\nIf there are any significant updates to the game, I will update my review.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505067199, "timestamp_created": 1505016021, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198120437431", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 391, "last_played": 1505185149, "playtime_forever": 159}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34769554", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Overall a fun card game I find myself playing when I don't have a lot of time, but I want to do something fun.
