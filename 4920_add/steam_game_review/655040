See if you can pick the demo up for free perhaps - the youtube video of Epic's demo appears similar to this - but with trees!}\n---\nI bought this for \u00a33.21 [ = $4.22], having heard about it via RPS, and would recommend it at that price, or modestly higher [gamestate 3-8-2017].\n\nYou pilot a glider (3rd or 1st person) around a snowy mountain / lake setting. It all looks quite beautiful, and runs very smoothly. I played it on a projector, which is a great experience. I imagine VR would be even more pleasant. \n\nThe audio is nice; quite understated, but so much the better for a relaxing experience, or allowing you to throw in some ambient (I'd recommend playing an mp3 such as Carbon Based Lifeforms: Frog!) \n\nWhile the title states 'simulator', it really isn't simulator handling. And where I have read others elsewhere say the handling takes some getting used to, or that there are thermals you should be paying attention to... I'd disagree - its initially semi realistic in that you are gradually losing speed or altitude, until - upon flying through a ring - acceleration occurs followed by sustained high speed for quite some time. Anyway, its nice handling, thats the main thing.\n\nThe asking price probably gets you an hour or so of relaxation and enjoyment, along with a pretty & peaceful game/experience to show the family some time.\n---\n[Niggles - written in case game author reads this - game graphics settings should be remembered between restarts and AA/AF options listed, levels should be switchable without need for restart, single HUD element should be togglable, strange issue with the number at the top of the screen that I had assumed was 'how many games have you found out of how many total [I got to 53/50?]', needs trees, might benefit from winds/thermals]", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501794047, "timestamp_created": 1501793677, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970371587", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 319, "last_played": 1501930886, "playtime_forever": 62}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34023795", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506456", "review": "[h1]Deltaplan Simulator[/h1] is a light-hearted and addicting flying skill game where you need to perform a variety of tricks and tasks flying on a hang-glider.\n\nGameplay\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S2tMO0M_7Q\n\nYou have to go through all the checkpoint circles.

If they do not accelerate, then we will lose speed and fall.\nThe game has 6 levels, but each of them differs only by a superimposed filter on the same map.\nFrom the disadvantages: after each game launch, you need to set the graphics settings.
