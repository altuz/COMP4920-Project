I was hit off the platform when looking at the wall vs. being beside it).\n\nResponsiveness of controls is acceptable with just enough inertia/momentum to make things interesting for some corners/jumps.\n\nSound/music is decent for this tier of game, though repetative.\n\nThere is a decent number of levels to play through, but replayability is very questionable--beyond beating one's best times. \n\nOverall this title is worth your money if you find it onsale or gain a discount coupon (I had a coupon for 90% off), or absolutely loved Marbleblast.\n\nP.S. (Edit)\nFYI, there are no checkpoints/saves in this title--if you perish you must restart the given level. This was only modestly frustrating on 2 levels (when trying to max out both time and stars) and overall does not detract from overall gameplay.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505933022, "timestamp_created": 1505932887, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989273094", "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 223, "last_played": 1505932459, "playtime_forever": 147}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35316825", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "review": "Who else got the 90% off for this game ?", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506730436, "timestamp_created": 1506730436, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561198135617641", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 10, "last_played": 1506730265, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35386431", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "This is the first $1 game I got a 90% off coupon for that actually had positive reviews. Pretty simple game overall, but it's decently fun and gets challenging at times. Graphics aren't bad either, although they're simple and every level looks the same. There isn't any music in the levels, only on the title screen, so that's a bit odd.\n\nOne thing though. Im playing this on a Macbook and the fan gets oddly loud while playing.
