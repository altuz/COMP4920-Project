It's a little hard to stumble upon others for a pickup game at the moment, but that will get easier over time as more people download the game. When playing with some of my friends, it was quite fun. It takes a little time to get used to manuevering and firing/aiming at the same time, but once you get the hang of it, there's nothing like zapping your opponents out of existance. The environmental details are a nice touch, don't overlook them while in the heat of battle.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502256770, "timestamp_created": 1502256770, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198284788465", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 2, "last_played": 1502000936, "playtime_forever": 153}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34083676", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491116", "review": "More people should buy it to have bigger matches. Me and my friend bought this game last day, I play on PC he has Oculus. I will try VR version at his house soon. He said it's very nice. We had great time, one of the games we played 2 more players joined, that was awesome. I mean it's an indie game, it has potantial. Hope more plyaers will join soon. If they will update often and add features and game types this game can be a winner. I would like to try a capture the flag kind of game in larger arena.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502118982, "timestamp_created": 1502118982, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198408993563", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 2, "last_played": 1502118619, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
