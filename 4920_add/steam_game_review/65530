However though it was fun to play, it left me a little disappointed. At a glance, everything about this game should mean I loved it. It was classic Spellforce. Except, it wasn't.\n\nFirstly, unlike the other incarnations of Spellforce, I could not create a female character, and there doesn't appear to be a reason for this (no male only references in the storyline etc). \n\nSecondly: It was short. So very, very short. I felt like the story had barely got going before it was over. The whole game feels like a demo for Demons of the Past, not a game in it's own right.\n\nAnd finally: The extra scenarios. After paying for a game that was almost insultingly short, I was offered 3 extra scenarios. For a fee of course. No thanks, I've forked over enough of my cash already. \n\nIt breaks my heart, but unless it comes up on sale, I cannot recommend this game, and I think my journey with Spellforce ends here. I certainly won't be paying full price for the next one.\n \n\n"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1398710684, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546743", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "9964329", "votes_up": 33, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000560738", "num_reviews": 800, "last_played": 1398710178, "num_games_owned": 5356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 643}, "timestamp_updated": 1398710684, "received_for_free": false, "review": "SpellForce 2: Faith in Destiny is dated, but that's no surprise.

Though I can't say I was fully satisfied by the whole of the experience but I really had fun playing it and its features nevertheless.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nFor an expantion based on a 2007 game they are pretty cool. You get sweet nature designs, accurate animations, fire-lightning-smoke and other effects. Not too bad water material for lakes and seas. Legit logic of terain designing combined with natural effects colors and mood.\nThe characters are also neatly done, you can see weapons and gear with enough details and light effects and you can even notice various cute details like smoke and sparks when gear hit against each other during fights.\nThe engine is kinda like a sweet magor upgrade from what the old RTT/RTS games used to be.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nNothing really extraordinarry. I haven't played any Spellforce games before so I had to do some homework in order to understand what was going on. \nThe background of what's going on is pretty cool, however the game itself doesn't really give you a good story-telling sequence during the game and doesn't let you get too enthusiastic about it. Though there are a couple of dialogue and cut scenes that help the game stay in the avevare mood.\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\n\nNot much to say. The units are pretty pretty sweet and there's an appreciated quantity and quality of units.\nHeroes are nice too. Was happy to see some basic voice acting that helped me enjoy the game [though i eventually removed all acknowledgement effects cause i was a tinny bit irritaed of them due to playing with many clicks I guess :P ]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nIt was ok. All features were sweet with the exception that there's unfortunatelly a bad balance between RTS and RPG.\nEventhough there are some good RPG ideas [gear upgrades, cool skills, skill tree etc etc] the averate taste in my mouth was that there was a bit more RTS than RPG going on.\nAlso the game was kinda short. No not from the average gameplay point of view. It took me around 20 hours to do the cempaign while exploring every inch of the maps. However the story goes on through some very few basic sequences and after a few maps that's it, you are done with the campaign. And your only hope for more gameplay is skirmishing and downloading custom maps. I know the cost of adding more maps in the main campaign is too big compared to skirmish maps, but 2 or 3 more maps in the main story would make it feel a lot more satisfying!\n\n[h1]Music/Sound[/h1]\n\nAverage neatly designed music additions with a bit of epic character. Nothing original.\nOne thing though is that I REALLY loved that the developers never missed to concentrate on the details regarding sound effects. You can hear your units' footsteps or wingflapping while they move when you zoom close to them and not by an average generated effect but by individually generated sound.\n\n[h1]Average[/h1]\n\nIt's a cute game. Don't keep high expectations about it and you'll have enough fun.\ni'd say it's above 6 cause it keeps you happy but bellow 8 cause they could have added some extra material and a better balanceed RPG experienced so I say it's a 7/10 for me.\n\n\nPS: I got it on a special offer. I strongly suggest you grab a similar chance to buy this on a better price  ;)"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1490283513, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508980", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "30686983", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000378204", "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1490283284, "num_games_owned": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1754}, "timestamp_updated": 1490283513, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I must admit I did enjoy Faith in Destiny.

And before anyone says, the protagonist is never even referred to by any other way than \"you\" and could easily be a woman.\n\nThe voice acting is also very subpar, yes even for a Spellforce game.\nAnd last, the probably biggest complaint is the story and lore. Any semblance to the other games is just superficial at best. You have a few cameos. But everything seems like they just took some fanfic off the internet and made a game out of it. A lot of characters act, well, out of character, if they have any at all. Somehow they dig up an even greater evil than the Fial Darg and don't even characterise it, but apparently they've been around since forever and two days.\nThis game is an empty shell.

Well...that's not what this is.\n\nFaith in Destiny feels like it was hastily cobbled together in a scenario editor with a month-long deadline for a finished product. The campaign has no voice acting and doesn't even bother with the illusion of choice like the previous campaigns did, instead just outright forcing you to play a male character. The campaign AI doesn't even pretend to play fair, instead spawning in units at set intervals because reasons, out-numbering you 10 to 1 and never actually doing anything but waiting for you to attack. Many map triggers and quests are broken, making the plot make even less sense than it would otherwise. You only find out why you're bothering to do any of what you're doing in the minute-long cut-scene after the final mission. \n\nAs to the multiplayer (never one of this series' strong points, really), the new race (the Nameless) have their buildings, units and tech tree designed in a way that makes it obvious they're meant to be played only by a cheating AI, though if you're allowed to actually climb their ridiculously overpriced tech tree you'll end up with two titans and a host of overpowered units and towers that there's really no counter to in competent hands. \n\nThe stand-alone scenarios are a little better in terms of both writing and gameplay (the AI doesn't cheat as hard), though broken scripts still abound, periodically making missions unwinnable because you climbed a hill from the left instead of the right.  All in all, don't bother with this, even if you liked the previous games, you'll just end up disappointed."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1468126270, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505322", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "24223452", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198004253967", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1468123921, "num_games_owned": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1212}, "timestamp_updated": 1468126270, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I 100% recommend this game for Spellforce fans. The nostalgia will be satisfied.\n\nFor non-Spellforce fans, I recommend it only if you're curious and are okay with a few hours of simple role-playing (the first hours in the game) that will grow more and more as you go and end with a blast.\n\nSpellforce 2 is a blend of RPG and RTS. The old game played for over 50 hours, this one plays for 15-20 depending on your pace. You start with a level 1 Shaikan character and you get to choose, along the way, how you wanna build it as it levels up. The old Combat/Magic skill trees make a comeback and a new Shaikan tree appears. You also start with a Shaikan companion so that means you can choose how to build her as well. \n\nAs I mentioned before, the game focuses on the RPG aspect at the beginning. It starts slow, since you have little skills and basic af leather armor, but you also level up quickly. After a few hours you'll be level 10 already, which means you get to have a few of the cool spells, and start facing tougher challenges. Those hours might be a slight let-down for few but the rest of the game more than compensates for them. The game focuses more on the RTS aspect in the second half. It is not easy, but it is great. \n\nThe story is connected to Spellforce 2. It's a follow up. Several of the old game's characters make an appearance (one even joins your party for a while like Nightsong did) and the feats you performed in the original game are mentioned (which is great for nostalgic fans like me). \n\nTwo new factions are included in Faith in Destiny (for a total of 5-6) and I felt satisfied with them. But the best addition to this game when compared to Shadow Wars was the item sets (besides the autosave function). If you complete the sets you get added bonuses (some of them boring ones like +100 health, other ones fun like 25% heal when killing). There are lots of sets for every character class.\n\nThis game might be a little rough around the edges in a couple of aspects but it is still a good one. \n\nIf you really buy this game, just two tiny advices: first, don't make your first companion an archer; you get one later in the game. Nothing wrong with having two archers, since you can specialize them later, but I think you'd like to have a wider pool of magic spells in your party. And second, I've added a couple of guides related to loot and weapons that might help you out.\n\nIn the end, I wanna thank the devs for this satisfactory experience as an old Spellforce fan.\n"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1390812942, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500060", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8866228", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198032371695", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1390724932, "num_games_owned": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1154}, "timestamp_updated": 1390812942, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I absolutely love the Spellforce series, and this game does have the classic Spellforce feel, however the storytelling leaves much to be desired, and the ending infuriated me.
