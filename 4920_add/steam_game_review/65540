I don't remember it being this buggy...\nBut I still love it XD If there was a game that I would buy if they made a remaster, it would be this one."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504716586, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496117", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34779118", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198190062466", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504447166, "num_games_owned": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 112}, "timestamp_updated": 1504716586, "received_for_free": false, "review": "VERI GUD GAMEEE im bak to my childhood :)"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506748766, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499670", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35323751", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198024068666", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1496587366, "num_games_owned": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1506748766, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This was my favorite RPG game back in time but currently it doesnt even start up on my pc."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504632162, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496247", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34760962", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198127656940", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504630613, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 10}, "timestamp_updated": 1504632162, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Could not start the game regardless of steps taken to fix it.
