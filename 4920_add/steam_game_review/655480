A smooth, minimalist aesthetic, and thoughtful design and balancing makes it a pleasure to play.\n\nIt's not quite as hard or engrossing as other puzzle / resource management games. If you've mastered SpaceChem or can score 17000 on Renowned Explorers or beat the \"triple challenges\" in Desktop Dungeons, this might be too simple for you. After 3 games as human to get the knack of it, I did a \"placement challenge\" game as the second race in the game and instantly got up to rank 20 (the highest ranking). So I suspect there won't be much challenge in it after I unlock all the races and play them each 2-3 times. \n\nIt looks like each race has a different playstyle, but not all that different. There is definitely a pattern for success, and once you get the feel for it I think it might become a bit repetitive.\n\nStill, for $10, it's a good buy and will provide a solid 10-20 hours of peaceful, space-exploration themed resource management fun.
