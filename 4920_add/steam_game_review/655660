Gameplay is smooth and enjoyable no crazy bugs that make it unplayable, and the gun upgrade feel like upgrades!   \n\n\nOverall I am having fun with it!", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505806528, "timestamp_created": 1505282039, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966000267", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 101, "last_played": 1505262059, "playtime_forever": 106}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35282966", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Brings back memories of Nes 1943.
