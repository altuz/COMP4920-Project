The puzzle/FPS mechanics are sometimes put to the side for more unconventional sections that always surprised me and made me want to keep playing just to see what was next.\n\nHowever, those were the only sections of the game that i saw as genuinely interesting. The game is held back by a few glaring issues that constantly got in the way of its interesting ideas:\n \n- The gunplay is poor. Enemies have no AI to speak of and get stuck on the environment constantly because of their nonexistent pathing. It's a shame because the guns you're given all look and sound like something you'd see in an actual FPS like Doom. The puzzles are enjoyable but extremely simple and conventional, a harmless distraction and nothing more.\n\n-Writing overall was meh: some of the poems found in the game felt rushed, especially when some of the rhymes were very clearly forced (Good prose beats Poor verse any day of the week). Some of the dialogue also read like something you'd see in an online chatroom rather than in a narrative focused video game but i suppose some people might prefer that style of writing that's more relatable and closer to how people talk IRL, i personally didn't. Some characters are also remarkably dumb, such as a lady that tasks you with jumping into a black hole for dubious reasons before confessing that she's afraid of being abandoned, even though you're the only other person present in the level she's in.\n\n-This game is insanely preachy: every piece of dialogue feels like the developers are trying to shove life lessons down your throat. I have no problem with some philosophy in video games, but not when nearly every piece of dialogue is trying to send a life changing message my way. I tried to run with it at first, but it became so persistent that it made me develop that \"you can't tell me what to do\" attitude you get when a game tries way too hard to tell you what's right and what's wrong.\nThis is more personal but i also found some of the depictions of mental health issues immensely misleading and naive: during a specific level you play as a character who has very obvious social anxiety and self esteem issues, but halfway through the stage you meet another character that, as stated earlier, throws a life lesson your way and suddenly fixes both of those issues instantly. I could brush this off as a joke or a small misstep, but not when This Realm Of Mine takes itself as seriously as it does. Some self awareness would've gone a long way in making these small problems more palatable.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506631952, "timestamp_created": 1506631952, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "steamid": "76561198032150922", "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 544, "last_played": 1506695904, "playtime_forever": 125}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
