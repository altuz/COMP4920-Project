After playing for 30 minutes, I refunded it. \n\n+ The game play was interesting (You can either become a fly or a waiter and your responsibility for each role is different)\n- Hard to control\n- Not a very balanced game of versus\n- HOW DOES ONE USE THE BUCKET TO CARRY WATER\n- Low replay value\n\nAdvice to developers: The customers die way too easily, just because you accidentally touched them while they are having their pizza, they just collapse on the ground. The spawning rate of customers is too fast too, maybe you can start slow with a tutorial or something before constantly spamming the birth of customers. The ratio of man to flies is just does not make sense as the man has to hold on to so many responsibilities while the fly simply has to just... fly around? But yet there are so many flies. Could be a funny and interactive game if the game play is a whole lot smoother with the developers putting themselves in the shoes of gamers.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500519804, "timestamp_created": 1500519804, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198134093090", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 36, "last_played": 1500385572, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33888329", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "not very well made.
