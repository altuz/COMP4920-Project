But this... This is a setback. I remember what was it like before the Enchanced Edition: a truely unplayable game due to model crashes, flickering graphics, buggy quests... And here's the EE version... which is nich\u00e9 compared to the original edition, but still a shitty game. A lot of buggy quests that can make you stuck and force to use discussions, walkthroughs. Model collisions are still a problem, idiotic pathfinding makes escort missions hateable... The graphics are almost the same if not worse than the 3rd episode. And the story... oh, the story... banal, clich\u00e9d, uninteresting, oversimplified and if you played a lot the earlier installments, you already know who are the bad guys and what they want. And also, do not forget the lot of mismatched voices to the characters, and the badly and poorly written forced lines, dialogues. Like a kid from kindergarten wrote these.\n\nThe only good point: the music is the same as the 3rd."}]}
