Me and my kids enjoy having figured out what the \"correct\" option is for a given outcome, and there are enough options that the game doesn't get boring.\n\nI think perhaps some randomized variety in the text for the various sites would be good. E.g., if you visit the restaurant every day of the week, you get different events and choices (good), but the \"intro\" restaurant text is the same each time, so soon you just click straight through it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505127901, "timestamp_created": 1505127901, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198414728015", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "last_played": 1505750842, "playtime_forever": 479}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
