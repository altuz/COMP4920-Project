It is obvious when u played the original game. Everything else does not make sense to me for this short \"game\". Guess Spellborn needed more time to \"finish\" the complete Arcania game back then but you know, when you have a publisher in the back who makes pressure and show you the business plan, it goes quick. So cut something from the original game out and make another game from that cut. Some extra money in this case. Better for the publisher, more bad for us the customers. \n\nThe whole standalone \"game\" is not worth it. I am glad I only paid a penny for that back then. At normal level you are extremely op. I only needed 3h to finish it. One of the worst endings (also in the original game)\n\nAt least I have finished 2 games from my huge game list. lol"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1492979177, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503027", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31327918", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198047384882", "num_reviews": 97, "last_played": 1492979086, "num_games_owned": 2318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 393}, "timestamp_updated": 1492979177, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Recommended if you own Arcania and get it on sale.
