An on-rails shooter *kinda* you go through scripted events shooting ground units and ships that all use the same 3 assets. Running off Unreal of all things, this looks polished for a game ran through Unreal but what it offers in content falls very short. \n\n4 stages I think, Fight on earth, fight above earth, kill a mothership and a boss back on earth. When I say boss, I mean click a lot on the person to win. Nothing of any actual threat can be thrown at the player, besides the hurling astroids section, that can be tedious, but with the option to enable auto-fire this aim and squeeze is a breeze. Same sounds for pretty much every action, same explosion used for small and large gets. \n\nI think It had a story, but the crackling of the audio and poor voicework made me mute it. A lot of still or idled animations. Much waiting for the actual 6 minutes of scroll shooting. \n\nNo badges but a simple achievement pool. Its not good, but for the price and what you are getting from it, ive seen far worse.
