After playing 'Vault of Honor' for a couple of hours I cannot wrap my head around the fact that this game is worth $5.49 -- that's a steal! Not in the common sense of the meaning... you're being robbed, darling. \n\nWhat is wrong with this game:\n1. There is absolutely no sense of accomplishment with this game; there are no achievements, milestones or goals to reach. \n2. The lack of a UI becomes an annoyance; there is no button to 'Pick' locks or 'Disarm' traps, instead you simply click anywhere on the screen; unlike Attack/Defend animations. \n3. The most obvious problem with this game is the price; this plays similar to that of a 2004 browser game.\n\nHow to improve this game:\n1. Add achievements (reach x floor, kill x monsters, x in game hours, etc); create a lore/atmosphere that is PRESENT. Give us something to think about in-game rather than having us wonder why we spent whatever we did on this game. \n2. Create a UI; make the weapon/armor drops viewable at the least -- like a gallery to see what they do. It could be tied into the first improvement point if used in a */100 sense. \n3. Reduce the price. If you add achievements and lower the price down to a more reasonable price of, say, $0.99 then people would definitely purchase it.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503231030, "timestamp_created": 1503185283, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052724304", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 81, "last_played": 1503183413, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33569058", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489303", "review": "Not bad if you just want a casual  relaxO game....I beat it in 3 hours,  it does have a bug though..when you are moving along  occassionlly all the action selections are blanked out,  and you are unable to select any of them... My work around was to hit the menu button then hit main menu button...It refreshes your game to where you left off stat wise and level of dungeon, but starts you out at a diffrent spot.
