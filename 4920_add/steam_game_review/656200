Best of it's kind in my opinion. Could do with possible new maps with the FPS game modes instead of just Dust II. English isn't be best and their are a few bugs. Overall though it has a very good base and start to a promising game. Would love to possibly help with the community in the future. Definately would recommend though.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506951045, "timestamp_created": 1506951045, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1228, "steamid": "76561198311200838", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 34, "last_played": 1506891958, "playtime_forever": 1333}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
