Infuriating in the fact that it is only luck to get past the levels due to having no knowledge of what colour or placement the AI is going to do next and since this is two thirds of the game; the odds are already against you. Addictive due to that one more try syndrome, just hoping you will do it. I got this for something like 90% off so I don't regret it but at full price; there are games which do this type of gameplay far better.
