Each line takes re-reading several times and guesswork to find its meaning, and as such I'm lost before I even finish the prologue.\n\nThe story, from what I have read, seems a little cheesy, which isn't a problem, BAD END certainly wasn't literary excellence, however when coupled with the poor translation, makes it feel like you're reading a young child's story.\n\nThe developers have previously managed to release solid titles, despite their cheesiness, however with the game in its current state, I would recommend you leave this one on your follow list and wait for an update on the translation so that you can start to make sense of it. Until that time, I do suggest going and checking out their other game, BAD END, to get a feel for what this developer can release when on form.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500226196, "timestamp_created": 1500226196, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082579084", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 288, "last_played": 1500225789, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
