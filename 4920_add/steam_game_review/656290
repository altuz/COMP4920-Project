And you are like invicible, you're in the outer space with some asteroids for the whole game.\nMenus too are confusing, you don't even know what you are supposed to do. There is no tutorial of sort, you only \"know\" that WASD keys and left mouse button should do something..\nNeedless to say, graphics are extremely bad. Be wary to headaches, since the ship would flip and go where it wants without doing anything.\nGot this game with a 90% discount, anyways, but it's really bad.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504873045, "timestamp_created": 1504873045, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "num_reviews": 115, "num_games_owned": 225, "last_played": 1504873035, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34875047", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512845", "review": "Achievement-Spam", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505096018, "timestamp_created": 1505096018, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046642155", "num_reviews": 192, "num_games_owned": 7062, "last_played": 1504087347, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34948602", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511245", "review": "Trash.
