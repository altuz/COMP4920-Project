Synthwave is one of my favourite genres of music and the music in this game is quite reminiscent of that genre. Very nice.\n\nThe sound effects are very satisfying too. If you reveal a card a sound will be played and it seems to come from slightly to the left. If you move a pile from the right to the left, you'll hear it get picked up in your right ear, and placed down in the left. A nice feature that is quite immersive. For solitaire at least.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Can't move cards from the foundation\n[*]Cards can be hard to read\n[*]No double click to auto-move \n[/list]\n\nI'm going to be honest, these things annoyed me quite a lot when I was playing. \n\nYou can't move cards down from the foundation, a fundamental feature that actually made me lose a game because I hadn't arranged the cards correctly from the start. I'm not that great at solitaire, so this is a feature that I would like to see implemented. Whether it be a toggle or just a standalone feature that is always there.\n\n(Devs have said they intentionally removed this)\n\n[quote=Thorium]Though we realize this is a hotly-debated topic amongst Solitaire players, we've decided to disallow \"takebacks\" from the Foundation. If you want a temporary storage place for your cards, play Freecell! >:D[/quote]\n\n\nThe cards can also be quite hard to read at times. Although the neon effect is nice, It doesn't help that the glow can make cards difficult to read. I have to concentrate for a short while because I can read the card I am looking at. Maybe skins could be added, weather it is creating your own and putting them into the game, or they are unlocked by playing. Something to make the cards easier to read would be nice. \n\nThere is also no double click to move cards. If I reveal an ace, I have to manually drag it into the foundations, same with all the other cards that need to be moved there too. I don't think a double click to move feature should be global (moving cards without thought) but just something simple to make the game more relaxing rather than having to waste time doing things I shouldn't have to.\n\nAuto solve. Simple. I don't want to have to drag the cards into their respective piles. They're hard enough to read as it it.\n\n[h1]Bugs:[/h1]\nOnce a combo starts, if you constantly rearrange your piles with kings on them your combo multiplier will rise. I got to about x57 by doing this.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nOverall I think Solitaire Ultra is a fun game, it's solitare. The things I pointed out were things that instantly caught my eye and because of this I can't rate it higher than a 5/10. This game lacks features that can be found for free in other variations of the solitare genre. With bug fixes and some skin redesign it could become better than the competition.\n\nBack to Windows Solitaire it is.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505636541, "timestamp_created": 1504432676, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041597545", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 176, "last_played": 1504431888, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
