There was no previews of any kind for this game and nobody talked about this game before it came out. \n\nI really enjoy this game. The graphics are pretty good in this game and the maps you play on are hex based maps on different terrains. The game is turned based and each turn you control military units to move and fire against enemy units. The game has great sounds effects when you fire different weopons against the enemy..\n\nI've only played the Single Player Campaign so far but I really like wihat I have seen so far in this game. The game has a good tutorial during the beginning of the Single Player Campaign and I recommend going trrough the tutorial to learn the basics. I don't think trying to learn the game is all that hard to learn. \n\nYou have alot of different untis to play with in the game. You have sniper units, infantry units, cavalry units, tanks, mortar units, artillery units, etc. There are alot of units in the game with special abilities and I enjoy using there ablilites. So far I think the AI is preety good in the game to play against. \n\nThis game might be in Early Access. but I feel it already has alot ot offer. I highly recommend this game.

It scratches that itch for a fairly short length, turn-based strategy game.\n\nReplay value is good because you can create your own maps and I think that is the best feature of the game. I do feel there needs to be a bit more AI skirmish features such as, more generated map size variations, different point variations for setup not just twenty points, and maybe a score talley dialog at the end of all skirmish matches.\n\nAdditionally, the AI could be improved some. All I really have to do to beat the AI every time is to group my units so that they support each other. Maybe different AI selections like offensive, defensive could help fill that void too.\n\nRight now as it stands I give the game 3.5 stars out of 5. That's pretty good for early access. Keep up the good work Devs!\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503972380, "timestamp_created": 1503972380, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "steamid": "76561198032627477", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 256, "last_played": 1506234382, "playtime_forever": 2508}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33553353", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480053", "review": "I like this so far!", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500103328, "timestamp_created": 1500103328, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018230241", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 8, "last_played": 1503110998, "playtime_forever": 476}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
