Its a fun little incremental game about watching number grow as you explore the galaxy and build up production buildings on the planets you find. You fly around in a ship which you can upgrade as you fight a never ending onslaught of enemies.\n\nWhile the core game play loop is great this game has a SEVERE case of console port going on. \n* There are no graphics options.\n* You can't change resoltion (all you can do is ALT+Enter to enable windowed)\n* You can't use multiple saves\n* The menues are a mess\n* The controls are nonsenseical and can't be rebound.\n\nIt's painfully obvious that the entire game has been made to be played with a controller and ZERO thought went into porting it over to keyboard. Playing dual joystick shooters on mouse/keyboard was never great, but it has never been this bad either.\n\nThere is no mouse support, swapping weapons can only be done with IJKL, forcing you to move your hands to a random place on the keyboard, boost is set to RIGHT shift; a button I haven't clicked for a game ever before. Swapping between tabs in the menus uses Shift and Control, something I had to ask the forums to find out.\n\nThe game also have some issues with turning on and off controllers while the game is on, so if you run into that I recommend restarting the game.\n\nAll of these problems should be trivial to fix with a patch, but until that happens I recommend getting this game ONLY if you play with a controller and you don't mind the lack of a proper options menu.\n\nIt's a real shame that developers treat the PC platform like this. If you really have no clue how a PC game should be designed, why not consult someone who does before you release the game?", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "8", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501260444, "timestamp_created": 1501260345, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197974727383", "num_reviews": 72, "num_games_owned": 685, "last_played": 1501448436, "playtime_forever": 1007}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33909641", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504297", "review": "I found the game addictive and fun although there a few non-game breaking bugs:\n - Incorrect text used to achieve certain goalsd\n - Doesn't count your build numbers properly if using the Build Max option \n\nI also managed to break it after building up Earth's income beyond  the game limit giving me infinite cash and taking my level over 9000.\n\nAs a tip, just leave the game running whilst you're busy doing something else and let the money build up.\n\nFor the number of hours I suink in the game it's good value too", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501435195, "timestamp_created": 1501435195, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976255427", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 108, "last_played": 1501433494, "playtime_forever": 2672}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33876750", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504850", "review": "A surprising mix of an incremental game (clicker without the clicking) and twin-stick shooter.

While Vostoc Inc. could be described as a hybrid between an idle game and a twin-stick shooter, it comes together as something more. \n\nAs far as idling goes: there is none. The game always gives you something to do, from mini-games to just roving through the galaxy picking fights, blowing up meteors, rescueing cast-aways or participating in races. The different star systems you can reach all have their own unique atmosphere and the writing (as charmingly aweful as the puns can be) is usually quite interesting. It's always fun to see how the diverse cast of natives react to your attempts to turn their homeworlds into a capatalist paradise. It's not invasion when you're an entrepeneur!\n\nThis causes the game to have a real sense of progression. While the buildings you place slowly rake in the cash, there's always the feeling there's something tangible you can do to help speed things along, rather than go through a mind-numing numbers grind. \nThe weapons and items you can buy in return, have a really nice feel to them too, with enough customization to keep things interesting. Several types can be combined to have different effects and with 19 sorts, there's genuine thought and strategy involved.
