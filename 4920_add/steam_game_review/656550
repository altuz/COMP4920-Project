I wasn't expecting very much given that it is an indie game for 5 dollars from a new studio, but Shadow Bug delivered everything I wanted and more. The unique movement mechanics of the game play extremely smoothly, and the levels are designed to be difficult despite the fact that a large portion of your movement is in straight lines between enemies. There is a secret collectible in every level, and a reasonable amount of flexibility in how you move through the game. \n\nAdditionally, the art and sound design is beautiful, and really adds to the intensity of the game's many tense platforming sequences. \n\nMuro Studios has managed to take a very simple concept and execute it perfectly, creating an intense and challenging experience. With 37 levels, my only real complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504961668, "timestamp_created": 1504961668, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029971723", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 37, "last_played": 1505499105, "playtime_forever": 1379}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
