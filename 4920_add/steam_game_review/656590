I played the analog version and I have to say that the digitized brother is more enjoyable. Things like glows, and victory point sum-ups are pretty obvious.. but now I can see how much this stuff works and it really does!  Now I can tell who is winning and why - when playing board game it was always kind of mystery ;-)\n\nDue to factions' leaders characters, soldiers, and soundtracks it's much more climatic than board version (I have never supposed I can tell such a thing).\n\nI wonder if the developer will release as the expansion or new game the sequel of the original board game \"Eight-Minute Empire: Legends\". I found it as the better board game (and more climatic), so probably should be better here as well ;-)\n\nAI players (BTW: Hard is really challenging) are fast thinkers (no surprise I guess) and I can literally play the game in eight minutes :D I write about it because despite the name, the original board game is 15-30 min game.\n\nHere on Steam 8ME is a great game in the same way like the original board game - as the \"filler\". When you would like to play some nice turn-based strategy, but you do NOT want to play all night (yup, I love Civ5 too ;-)), then Eight-Minute Empire is just perfect! I strongly recommend it for this purpose!\n\nLove the fact, that there is hot-seat mode (so not only on-line multiplayer is possible)!", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504774407, "timestamp_created": 1504774407, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "steamid": "76561198061623088", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 101, "last_played": 1506768288, "playtime_forever": 264}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34906647", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508254", "review": "I purchased this game and quickly realized you needed to pay for each additional map. Something like $3-4 each. I'm sorry, but that's insane for such a small and simple game. Also there should be options for longer games. I like the art. I like the gameplay, but even at a discount the game is $20 fully unlocked. I've played way more interesting games with way longer gameplay for less than $10 as the base price. I think Terraria was like $10-14 and I got over 100 hours of good gameplay from that. \n\nLuckily I was able to request a refund.\n\nCool idea. Again it was fun, but terrible, terrible value.

I've played the physical game and this is a nice digital version with the added bonus of an AI so I can play solo.  There's a multiplayer option but haven't tried it yet. \n\nThis doesn't feel like a crappy tablet port and seems to work well with a mouse.\n\nThe map packs are pricy considering the content but the Emperor Edition has a decent discount to offset the high cost.  Still, I think it would have been better to bundle the 4 maps into a single DLC.  I know its common on phone games to piece out the content in high cost little chunks, but PC users don't appreciate that.\n\nBesides the DLC issue, it's a cute little game that's a good lunchtime diversion.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504758034, "timestamp_created": 1504758034, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198008597223", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 547, "last_played": 1504949325, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35184279", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502952", "review": "Owned it and asked for a refund. The foremost reason I asked for a refund was because the game won't work in fullscreen on Linux Mint (known bug in an obsolete version of Unity) and that after waiting for 1.5 week, asking for a fix in three different ways (forum, email, in-game contact) the answer was to wait which would disable my ability to ask for a refund.\n\nBut I don't really regret the decision, because the game isn't worth the asking price. It's way too simple and I could code it on my own if I were a better graphical designer. The concept is simple, too simple, and might be fun for a board game for what-will-we-do-that-is-not-too-hard evenings with friends. But as a PC game, the simplicity makes it a bit boring.\n\nI read that the AI is very good. That is actually true, but with these simple game mechanics, creating such an AI isn't too much of a challenge either. The approach of just looping through all possible actions and selecting the best one is sufficient because within the limits of the game, this will never take more than a couple of milliseconds to calculate.\n\nAlso, the DLC is just some extra maps and I believe one DLC adds some extra rules. I bought all DLC's when I bought the game and it gave me 3 extra gameplay options that didn't seem to give that much extra spice to the game. I must admit though that only playing the game for about an hour may not have been enough to fully understand the implications of these extra's but my feeling tells me that it wasn't worth the big extra bucks charged for it.\n\nFor these reasons, I can't recommend the game for the asking price.\n\nMaybe, a big maybe, if the game is on sale some day for say 5.99 for the whole package, AND if the bug is fixed (it's as 'simple' as upgrading to a newer version of Unity which should not be a hard task if you are a good developer), then maybe I will buy it again and I would recommend buying it, because the game isn't bad.\n\nNo, the game isn't bad at all, it has been worked out quite good (except for the bug of course, I hate playing games in windowed mode), but it's way too simple and too boring for the asking price.\n\nYou might ask which games are cheaper and much more challenging (but less eye-candy)?
