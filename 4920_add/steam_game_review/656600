The point is that I consider myself pretty experienced in rhythm games.\n\nI don't really review games on Steam. About 5 or 6 years ago I wrote a few reviews for about 5 games or so on here, but I quickly decided to stop because I didn't feel like my word held any kind of importance. But after playing this game, I felt a strong urge to write down my thoughts and opinions on it so at least one other person would see it. The world needs to know.\n\n[h1]Slash It Ultimate is by far the worst rhythm game I have ever played.[/h1]\n\nI need to break this game down and explain what it does wrong piece by piece. Thinking about it now, the number of things that this game does wrong is honestly overwhelming, but I'm going to try anyway. This is important.\n\n[list]\n[*]There are only 15 songs in the game. That's it. And you can't play all of them from the beginning. You have to save up enough coins to purchase the next song.\n[*]There are 7 game modes, and if you want to play a certain song in a certain game mode, you have to purchase it. If you buy the game mode for one song, you have to buy it again for another song. And the other one, and the other one, all 15 of them.\n[*]All 7 of the game modes are terrible in their own special way. Most of them don't even feel like they're rhythmically connected to the songs at all! In fact, let me explain why each game mode is so bad. [i]This is important.[/i]\n[/list]\n\n[olist]\n[*]Arrows: Similar to DDR or Stepmania in that you use the 4 arrow keys to play along with the song. The thing that's wrong here is that the arrows don't stay in their own column. There are 4 columns, and in DDR for example, the left arrow stays on the far left column for the whole game. Not here. There is no rhyme or reason why an arrow will be placed at whatever column- there is no sense of flow, no sense of order, it's just random. It's beyond frustrating.\n[*]Words: You type out words. That's it. You ever play a typing game? Typing of The Dead? Then you've played this. The best part is, there is no connection to the rhythm at [i]all.[/i] And if you have two words on the screen, like \"Introduction\" and \"Creation\" then if you try typing \"Introduction\" first, when you press the \"c\" that is in \"Introduction\" then it will start typing the other word, \"Creation\". This becomes severely frustrating once you have 5 words on the screen at once.\n[*]Alphabet: Literally just like the words game mode, no connection to the rhythm playing in the background, and this game mode has a delightful habit of having the letters cut off off screen so you lose your combo because you can't see the letters. Why this was never noticed or fixed, I don't know. Again, [b]there is no reason that this needs to be a rhythm game at all, it adds nothing to the songs playing in the background.[/b]\n[*]Spacebar: Press the spacebar when something goes to the center of the screen. Like Arrows, but this time you have one button instead of 4. These are so poorly designed that honestly all you have to do is tap the spacebar to the rhythm of the song and that's it, nothing else.\n[*]Mouse: Move the mouse to a circle as notes come to it. Ugh, this is the closest to a rhythm game on here, but it's so sensitive and janky and feels so unsatisfying that it still fails miserably.\n[*]Numbers: It's just the Alphabet game mode but with the number pad instead. It's terrible. I can't describe how poorly designed this thing is.\n[*]Cube: Move a cube around. Again, as like most of these game modes, this rhythm game has a disturbing habit of feeling like there is little to no connection between the gameplay and the music being played. Every time you jump as the cube, the camera changes from 2-D sidescroller like a standard Mario platformer, to behind the cube similar to Crash Bandicoot games. [b]Every. Time. You. Jump.[/b] It's the most disorienting and unsatisfying experiences I've felt in a rhythm game.\n[/olist]\n\nThis game has over 500 achievements. Why? WHY?? You spend the whole game just getting flooded with countless achievement notifications every waking second you're playing. You can turn off the achievements in settings, but why would anyone ever include this many achievements? 500? There are only 15 songs! It's insane. Simply insane. I can't stand it.\n\nThe game didn't save multiple times. I played the game for about 40 minutes, closed it, then opened it again and all the progress I made, all the songs and game modes I purchased and unlocked, all my high scores in each song were just wiped. I played a couple songs and closed the game and re-opened it to see if it saved, and it did. I shrugged it off, assuming it was a glitch, then when I opened it a third time I saw that yet again everything was wiped. It's like the game is trying to anger me.\n\n15 songs, none of which are that good in all honesty, 7 game modes, all of them failing in the worst ways, practically 80% of the game not even feeling like it has any connection to being a rhythm game, just typing games with music in the background, all for $5.00.\n\nDon't buy this game. It's terrible. It's a waste of time and money and even if it was free I'd implore you to not get it. It's a slap in the face to rhythm gaming as a whole. It's worse than some free flash rhythm games online. It's the worst rhythm game I've ever played. I don't know what else to say.\n\nThe graphics look pretty alright though, I guess.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503457742, "timestamp_created": 1503456642, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198069606279", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 95, "last_played": 1503457252, "playtime_forever": 61}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33883718", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496313", "review": " \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u0631\u0641 \u0648\u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0636\u0628\u0637 \u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0621\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0635\u0648\u062a \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0626 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0625\u0644\u0639\u0628\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u062c\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u064a \u064a\u062d\u0628 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u064a \u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0632\u0647", "votes_down": 11, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501343278, "timestamp_created": 1501343278, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "steamid": "76561198062469442", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 1368, "last_played": 1506446928, "playtime_forever": 78}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33580935", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494041", "review": "Nice Game!", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500198670, "timestamp_created": 1500198670, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198206089535", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 151, "last_played": 1500203248, "playtime_forever": 75}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
