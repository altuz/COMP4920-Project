Gameplay can be vaguely described as exploration game with elements of surviving and stealth. You have to look for items hidden around the map and match them to correct puzzles. Although I think it relies too much on nostalgia to a point where it feels unintuitive. So far I am enjoying it but I might wait for developer to adjust some of the features so I can experience it better. \n\nYou play as a vampire who can roam at night but must hide during a day. There is a day/night system which you will need to pay attention to. If you get killed by any means other than Sun you simply respawn next to your castle where you can regain your strength. However, if you killed by Sun the game is over. You can also turn into a human for a limited time which allows you to move undetected.\n\nAt the time of this review, there is no Save feature ( which seems to be intentional design ) Hopefully the developer will do the right thing and change it.There is some forced backtracking especially if you get killed by the sun which is permadeath. Even though I like the funny cutscenes and dialogue I have already seen some of it 20 times. It seems that developer sees it as some kind of high score oriented game but I just want to see all the jokes.\n\nPixel art is decent in regards to what this game is going for. Still, I think some of the areas are too generic and there should be more variety. The swamp area looks really dull for example and those immortal animals that attack you are so annoying. Also, the music is appropriately fitting but there is not enough of it. Like more areas need unique soundtrack instead of one song in 80% of the game.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the game is the sense of humor. Just the idea of you being a vampire running in and out of your castle is fun. Refreshing concept but not very well executed. \n\n[h1] Score: 5.5/10 [/h1] ( 6/10 if developer adds a save feature or multiple modes )\n\nYes, I recommend it BARELY. It seems like it might be a fun game to explore but some of the features right now hold it back. It is funny enough not to refund it but it is also extremely tedious without saving files. I just want to play it for the \"story\". It has a lot of little issues that bother me but for the price, I appreciate what is there.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500338881, "timestamp_created": 1500267895, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "last_played": 1500943123, "playtime_forever": 343}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33726931", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499544", "review": "My Video Review for Dead Of Night:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4m1dIUyXai8", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500748317, "timestamp_created": 1500748317, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198200221299", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 19, "last_played": 1500807836, "playtime_forever": 295}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
