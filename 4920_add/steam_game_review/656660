I know that because I've added the whole series on Neoseeker. That's why when I saw it on Greenlight, I voted yes, despite the fact that it's just puzzles after puzzles.\n\nThe thing is that the 15th opus isn't so much different from the 14th. The only difference is that I wasn't bored at firt, as I've grown fond of the series. Also, the number of hours passed in Ancient Land has decreased by half, as I've acquired some thinking patterns, allowing me to go faster and with less errors.\n\nBut the question is: what's a griddler or a nonogram? You must reveal a drawing by \"blackening\" a certain number of tiles in the row or in the line. However, each number represent tiles being next to each other: if you see 3, you know that you have three tiles without any space. The difficulty can vary: between full lines or columns or only tiles possibles at the end, you have to think when you have a line or a column of 1-1-1-2-1-3. But like I've said, some tricks can help: when there is a space between two tiles, you know that this space can't be used at all.\n\nThe plot isn't really important: a family of penguins travelling around, discovering more colors or unlocking new items for the \"garden\". What's really keeping me is to make no errors to have three stars or a golden cup (no hint, no mistake). Like in the 14th, the drawings aren't really interesting for me. \n\nAnd if it's the challenge which is keeping me in the game, it means that you need to be interested to challenge your brain and more if you want to play without the numbers being crossed (which I'm not even doing as I find the casual difficulty hard enough).\n\nThe real negative point is a price I find a little too high for what's provided, however, with a discount, it may be interesting to buy. However, the 14th and the 15th games are really similar, it could be only one game if the PC/Mac version wasn't following how they were released on iOS and Android - because, yeah, it's a port of a mobile game.\n\nThe 16th game, just released on Steam, is providing more change as the palette of colors is now extended to six, just for your information. But I'm still curious about the earlier works and how the series evolved.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499871366, "timestamp_created": 1499871366, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971532357", "num_reviews": 352, "num_games_owned": 2214, "last_played": 1499716456, "playtime_forever": 844}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
