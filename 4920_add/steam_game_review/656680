It does have a couple of gun turrets that can be placed in the level, but It is more of a a puzzle/defense game.  \n\nIt's different than most games of it's genre. It is a thinking man's game with different ways to pass a level.  You first select a level, then decide what kind of traps, blockades, guns, bombs and other devices you want to bring into the level to beat it.  You do have a budget, so you must choose wisely from a list and cannot take too much into the levels with you. You can change the difficulty settings in the Options menu and it will give you more starting cash.\n\nBasically, enemies will try to kill your kitten!  You must stop them at all costs!!!  This is a serious trial and error type of game.  The maps get more difficult and placement of things sometimes requires A LOT of trial and error!!!  You will most likely fail your first few (or more) attempts on each map.  You don't seem to get penalized for failing though. \n\nTIP: To look at the map before playing it, close your inventory screen by clicking the minus button at the top right corner of the inventory screen.  The whole map will be revieled.  Then reopen the inventory screen by clicking the \"Inventory\" button at the bottom of the screen.\n\nIt is an average game done well.  Seems polished and works great on my 2015 MacBook Pro! Like I said, it's fun, but it's not really your \"traditional\" Tower Defense game. I do like it so far!  I recommend it to fans of puzzle games and kitten lovers! :-) Get it on sale now!\n\nHardware Overview: \n\nModel Name: MacBookPro 11,5 (Mid 2015)\nProcessor Name: Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed: 2.8 GHz\nNumber of Processors: 1\nTotal Number of Cores: 4\nL2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\nL3 Cache: 6 MB\nMemory: 16 GB Type: DDR3 Speed: 1600 MHz\nVideo Card: AMD Radeon R9 M370X, VRAM 2048 MB\n\nOperating System: OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (64 bit OS)", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499289031, "timestamp_created": 1499286370, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198073648775", "num_reviews": 119, "num_games_owned": 790, "last_played": 1499290144, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
