Temple Run looked better when it came out than this garbage.\nOptions are pretty much non-existant. Aside from the launcher where you can choose your resolution and your standard graphics settings from fast to fantastic, there are only sound options in the actual game.\nControls are not terrible but what you can expect from a runner game.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by the singleplayer tag. Everytime i start a race it tells me that it looks for other players but as you can maybe guess, so far i had no luck and was running against bots with a rubberbanding AI that's just not fair. They can always come back even when you got all the boosts while they got none of them.\n\nAs it says in the description you get some gems which i  guess is the microtransaction thing they got for mobile. It's enough to buy all the costumes for the available chars. But they are only a different color scheme.\n\nBest thing is that they actually think someones gonna play this in the future cause there are still 4 chars locked with a coming soon banner.\n\nAll in all i really can't recommend this game. It is too high priced for what it offers.\nI don't understand why some companys still think that license games like this one are acceptable.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502388148, "timestamp_created": 1502388087, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197990912078", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 6451, "last_played": 1502387706, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 17, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
