The most important part about this game are the puzzles. The graphic design is a bit outdated, but it has its own charme. The puzzles are great though. I think it fits to compare this game to the Myst Games. The puzzles in Rhem are - in my opinion - a bit more technical than in Myst; really, most of the time you are working with machines. \nThe puzzles can be solved with logic. I haven`t seen any puzzle in there that must be solved by try & error. Some of the puzzles are really difficult though. And by that I mean... incredibly difficult. \n\nThe only thing i dislike about this game (but well, it`s typical for many point & click games) is the walking distance the player has to travel: 'Ouh - i have forgotten something in another part of Rhem, let`s walk like 3 minutes by spamming the mouse button'. It`s kinda nice that the developer added a Skip Mode where you can skip some long passages of walking, so it`s not that exasperating anymore. That helped me keep my sanity there... thank you for that ^^\n\nDefinitely a game i would reccommend for expert puzzle fans. Really, just try it. It`s great ;)\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501578728, "timestamp_created": 1501578728, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198161727032", "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 580, "last_played": 1501577902, "playtime_forever": 750}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34325114", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517541", "review": "To say RHEM I SE: The Mysterious Land is dated is like saying Mozart and Rembrandt are dated.  This is an extremely well crafted set of puzzles and searches built around a story of sorts, but that's not what's important.  What is important is that you are given, apparently, no directions on what to do next.  The story tells you that you are looking for something, and as soon as you start you are apparently trapped in this mysterious world of machines, passages, elevators, trams, trapdoors, pumps, levers, possibly significant artworks and some books.  At first everything seems irrelevant, but every time I've played the original I've filled a half inch of 3x5 cards with notes.\n\nI bought this game when it first came out long, long ago, back when graphics were primitive, and I've played it at least five times - each time learning something new about how to tackle a certain puzzle.  You can't solve them by trial and error.  You have to look elsewhere for clues and (if you recognize them as such) outright answers.  The usual workflow is: What does that machine do?  It doesn't work.  Wait a minute; it needs to be powered on.  Where did I see some electrical cables strung around?  If I look outside, will I be able to follow the cable back to where it gets power?  How does this system of pipes and valves get me some power?  Damn! How do I get back to where I needed the power?  There's a book full of symbols; better take some notes.  That's nonsense - no - wait a minute; I saw something like that way back over there.  Trust me, you'll never remember it all without your notes.  I always threw out my notes after I'd finished, though.\n\nIf you have an urge to find a walkthrough, you are missing the whole point of this type of game.  As you work into a new game, be cognizant of your thought processes as you solve the puzzles and mysteries.  None of these puzzles are solved by copying an answer from some clue; you have to actually think, and studying how your multi-step thought processes work is an education in itself.\n\nAs a physics teacher, I am confronted by students who want to know which formula to use.  I never tell them.  I make them understand what little they can and then start again on the problem.  I've purchased used copies of the RHEM series over the years and given them to certain students whom I identified as not performing up to their problem solving potential.  In every case (and I played the game along with them at times) that student felt so empowered after solving a tough RHEM puzzle that tackling physics problems became a game rather than a dead end.  Now this game is available through Steam, so I am able to gift it directly.  School starts in three weeks!  RHEM IV: The Golden Fragments is also available through Steam.  I'm hoping for a RHEM V!\n\nThis game is the work on one man, Knut Muller, who created the visual world of RHEM with Bryce, the free 3D authoring tool, and put it all together with (then) Macromedia Director.  Some complain that it's a long way from one place to another, especially if you just found out you really needed that crazy symbol sheet.  I disagree: it's a pleasure building a representation of the RHEM world in your mind.  Every once in a while he gives you a map, but even the map is cryptic.  In this SE version he has added a new place.  The puzzle to get you there is devilishly complex but suddenly doable after several levels of thinking.  It's a pleasure to replay the whole series (I through IV) every few years.  It gives me a perspective on just how simple and senseless most other computer games are.  Knut Muller is a genius - just like Mozart or Rembrandt.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503052853, "timestamp_created": 1503050609, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198149542773", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 10, "last_played": 1503057052, "playtime_forever": 1642}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
