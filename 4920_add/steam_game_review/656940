The goal of the game is to trade 100 coins per stage for gold ingot and when you have enough ingots, to buy the plane. \n\nLets begin with the positives and work our way down. Art wise, I feel the game is done well. To overcome flat looking stages in a 2D style, the stage backgrounds are drawn in layers, allowing for depth in in the levels that it would otherwise be missing. This detail can also be seen in the enemy types which vary in look and are in line with the level environment. They all move in set paths and are destroyed by jumping on them (except one type that cant be squashed), but this variety keep the stages interesting during the initial run through.\n\nThe music is an 8bit synth style and is fine to listen too while playing. There is no way lower the volume of the game music or turn it off that I have found, so hopefully you enjoy it if you buy the game. :)\n\nControl wise, it is a simple platformer, with left - right and a jump key. It can be controlled by either keyboard or a gamepad, but for some reason the game has been designed that you need to press a button to transfer control from a gamepad to keyboard or back again. I don't understand why it was designed in this way, and initially I did not have my controller connected so when I ran the game I could not actually start it. It wasn't until I reloaded the game with a controller attached that I found I needed to press the enter key to move controls to the keyboard. \n\nIn game physics is a bit off, on early stages if either foot is not on a platform you fall off, but as the game progresses you can stand with one foot off a platform and stay on it. Also enemy hit boxes are noticeably larger then they are drawn, so you can take damage if an enemy has not touched you or you can destroy an enemy sometimes by landing next to it. Inconsistencies like this don't make for an enjoyable playthrough.\n\nFinally is the game length. There are a total of 10 stages, each of which can be completed within 3 minutes provided you don't die and have to start over. This means you can see all the content in half an hour, but you get one gold bullion per level and need to buy the plane for 600 ingots. Going for this final goal would result in repeating each of the 10 stages at least 60 times, at 3 minutes a stage you would be looking at doing the same levels for 30 hours. I cannot understand why the plane is so expensive, or why anyone would play the same 10 stages for that long just to get it.\n\nAs it is on release, I cant recommend this game as I while feel it is an OK platformer in gameplay (putting aside the few game bugs) it comes across as unfinished in design.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500677767, "timestamp_created": 1500642250, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960286303", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "last_played": 1500637198, "playtime_forever": 94}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
