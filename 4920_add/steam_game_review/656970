A lot of the puzzles are to access the three red gems that are on each level. These are optional so you could probably skip a lot of the puzzles if you want. Personally, I cannot force myself to move to the next level until I have all three.\n\nSome of the bosses are deceptively tricky, a couple of them annoyingly so, but you have a limited number of revives you can use in the middle of a boss fight to keep going. I have not really figured out where the revives come from, but I always seem to have several. There is a checkpoint before each boss so you can quickly try again if out of revives.\n\nThere is an inventory screen that holds items that you can buy or maybe find. I've bought two items but not found any yet.\n\nI'll update the review once I've beaten it.\n\nEdit: I'm about 9 hours in now, and probably done playing it, at least for now. I'm on the 4th set of stages, and for me, it's getting more frustrating than fun. I still got my moneys worth of fun out of it, and it really is well done, just be aware that it gets very difficult a few hours in.\n\n2nd Edit: The recent updates have helped the frustration level a lot.

This not only explains why the games are so similar art-asset and mechanic-wise, but also means that MagiCat's developer is well within his rights to use these assets as he likes.\n\nI apologise for any confusion I may have caused.\n\nWith that cleared up, I can now happily recommend MagiCat as it is a cute and enjoyable 2D platformer with tight controls and smooth gameplay.\n\nI'd be hardpressed not to compare it to Miracle Fly even now, the two are very similar in many ways after all. MagiCat has the charm and puzzle elements from Miracle Fly but replaces the mouse controlled flying element with a control scheme more akin to Super Mario Bros 3. The game has some sort of story, delivered through cutscenes with meow-ish dialogue; a script sometimes difficult to follow, but with clear and concise acting to make up for it. Sound design and music could use some work at times, but the charming asthetic and slick gameplay more than makes up for it.\n\nIf you like cats and you like platformers, you will probably like this game!\n\n\n\n\nFor clarity's sake you can find my previous statements below. Just know that after having been informed that the developer behind MagiCat previously worked on Miracle Fly, my thoughts are no longer the same. \n\n------------------\n\nI don't like making assumptions, and so I won't. But I would very much like a response from the developer or publisher for MagiCat because there is something that has been bugging me about this game since the moment I laid eyes on it.\n\nAs much as I do genuinely enjoy MagiCat and I do believe it is a well designed and fun game, some of the artistic choices, and the Overworld map design in particular has me baffled. You see, when I picked this game up, I instantly thought of another game released 2 years ago called Miracle fly. The overworld map looked identical to me when I first saw screenshots of it in the store, and when I opened the game up even more so. You can see a comparison here: http://imgur.com/a/NjmlL For a video comparison of the two games click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4n-KhkQc7w\n\nAs the game seems to be heavily inspired by Miracle fly, to the point where I thought they shared assets, I believed this game to be from the same developer team or publisher. But it is not. I do not know much about videogame development laws and I won't pretend I do, nor do I believe this is enough to claim plagiarism, but in some areas I feel it does border on it and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nThe similarities do not end with the overworld map, they merely start there. The game's enemies and bosses are very similar as well, as are the 3 red gems you are tasked to find in each level, the coloured buttons and corrisponding walls you are to manipulate to traverse the areas among other things.\n\nAs previously stated, I do believe MagiCat is a fun game, and I can see some real effort was put into the game's coding as your character moves smoothly and platforming is satisfying. However, the art direction (although more retro inspired with pixelated graphics) does come far too close to Miracle fly without being made by the same team to worry me.\n\nIf I could get a response from MagiCat's dev or publishers clarifying the similarities (perhaps they're simply free assets in a program like unity), then that would do much to lighten my mood. As it stands though, I am not sure if I can recommend MagiCat due to my previously stated shakiness when it comes to its drastically similar assets to those used in the previously released game Miracle fly. Despite how much I enjoyed playing the game in the short while that I did before deciding to compare its art assets to those of Miracle fly, which thereby prompted me to write this review, I have decided to request a refund for MagiCat unless I get a response clarifying the similarities and assuring me that no plagiarism has taken place.\n\nSincerely, Sinful Sorcerer.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503518707, "timestamp_created": 1503502965, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006879453", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 894, "last_played": 1503504032, "playtime_forever": 59}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34459182", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480149", "review": "it deosnt work for me", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503578906, "timestamp_created": 1503578906, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198342565045", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 7, "last_played": 1503664802, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
