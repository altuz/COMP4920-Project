Much better story, and continuity is good.\nIf you like puzzles, try Parallels Cross.  It is a good puzzle game, but still mostly HOG. (or ASA: A space adventure, for serious puzzlers)\nIf you like exploration, ?\nIf you are sick of Artifex Mundi, and want something different except the same, try Frankenstein: Master of Death.  They made a good game.\n\nHonorable mention: Dark Arcana: The Carnival -- good plot, good mood, decent puzzles.\nHonorable mention: The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams, cohesive, good mood, decent puzzles.\nHonorable mention: Nightmares from the Deep series. imaginative and cohesive. OK puzzles, good mood.\n\nBut back to Myth Seekers: The Legacy of Vulcan.  The plot line got destroyed.  This seems like a production issue.  Big dreams, didn't spend enough time/money getting the narrative to fit the graphics and gameplay.  High resolution graphics is there, if that is a big thing for you.  It's pretty obvious when they added text to try to make the animated scenes make sense.  Hi-res graphics? check.  Puzzles? a bit above (Artifex Mundi) average, I think.  There were two puzzles that made me stop and think for a bit, so there's that.\n\nOne thing that Artifex Mundi does heads and shoulders above all the rest: I know the game will work.  No show-stopper bugs.\n\n*shrug* Doesn't really stand out otherwise.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502691890, "timestamp_created": 1502691890, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198253542477", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 133, "last_played": 1502575337, "playtime_forever": 1099}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34612293", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "review": "The Myth Seekers: The legacy of Vulcan\n\nOKay so I love HOGs, this was the newest in the store s i got it in hopes it runs better then the older ones.\n\nPros:\n Absolutley beautiful; has stnning scenes \nPuzzles are easy-medium in difficultly ( a pro if you do not like spemnding 30+ min on a single puzzle)\nHas an interesting story line\n\nCons:\nNo way to set the screen res. NOt that any other game like this does. Wold just be nice as i se a 48\" 4k TV as a monitor...\nSome steps and pzzles are super vague. \nStory line gets a bit gumbled and the ended was unsatisfactory. it literally just ended. no explaination on what happened afterwards. \n\nOver all a good HOG. ive played a few of AMs' games an have enjoyed them all. I would LOVE to see a much much longer game, ive been avereging about 3-4 hors per game. \n\n\nps. ignre the misspellings this keyboard sucks lol.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504110681, "timestamp_created": 1504110681, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198351220633", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 78, "last_played": 1504052221, "playtime_forever": 193}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
