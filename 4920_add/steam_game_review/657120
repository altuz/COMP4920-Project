Is it the greatest game/story ever?\n\nNo.\n\nIs it well worth the hour and the $0.99?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nNormally I'd say you get what you pay for, but the light humor and cute characters are well worth the entry fee. There isn't much to this game so the list of positives/negatives isn't very long, but the stories are short and sweet and the simple design actually leads to equally likeable characters. The one thing I didn't get was the extra characters didn't really fulfill what was expected of them. This is a small gripe though that could be interpreted another way for other people.\n\n[h1]Overall Score: 8/10\n\nSPOILERS:[/h1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[spoiler]Okay so I really do wish the background characters had a bigger role considering they give you the option to have your character accept offers. I don't really see the point of accepting or not since you don't see them actually go through with the options or anything like that.[/spoiler]", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502583326, "timestamp_created": 1502583326, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198087422220", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 181, "last_played": 1502582726, "playtime_forever": 70}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34002221", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509683", "review": "Simple, sweet game that could be categorized as the gaming world's equivalent genre to feel good movies.
