(with \"choose two\" it's the same mechanic as memory, click two/three pieces and make them go away - they're not hidden as in memory though)\n\nIn that game a pixel perfect mouse pointer is a must and this game is far from having that, I clicked on something - visible but not a lot of it - and the book in the center decided I clicked on it...very frustrating. (the hint system during this was completely useless as well, it did work well on the normal \"choose two\")\n\nI can not recommend it for that reason, it should either have the pieces more visible and obvious or the mouse pointer 100% exact. (the time I've played has been spent mostly in these as the normal puzzles have been normal puzzles and thereby easy to finish)", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500655868, "timestamp_created": 1500655868, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138101163", "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 152, "last_played": 1500655343, "playtime_forever": 98}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
