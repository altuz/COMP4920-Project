In total, there are 5 bosses (Not counting the post game content) that, to an extent, spice up their game which each enctounter. The game is played in 2D with very beautifully animated sprites, but tends to use some of the 3D Landscapes for boss attacks. You have 1000 HP by default, and In your kit you can do a 2-Combo Slash, a 500 HP heal which takes a few seconds to pull off, a block that halves the damage of any oncoming attack, and a quick dash from left to right. The controls feel a bit off and constricted at times, especially when you're in the middle of an attack combo and want to block an attack you failed to see but can't. It goes double for trying to dash left or right, I can never consistantly pull it off because you need to double tap the directional buttons in the direction you want to dash in (I'm using an Xbox 360 controller, for reference, and you move with the analog sticks. However, I believe you can use the D-Pad for movement as well.). While the controls may feel janky, the boss battles make up for it in that they aren't that difficult and don't take long (Except for the 3rd and Final Boss, those two can catch you off guard if you're not on your A game.). In terms of story, well, it can be best summarized in the store page of this game. You're a goat girl who's freeing souls that reside in these bosses, nothing deep but nothing confusing.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth the 5 bucks. It's short, but can offer some extra challenges if you so choose. Compared to other games of this quality of \"just throw something together quick\", it's alright. Compared to other games in it's genre, like Furi or Titan Souls, it's pretty weak. That being said, if you're a fan of boss rushes, you'll still have a good time.\n\nThis is a cool game, 3 Electric Sheep out of 5", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500346104, "timestamp_created": 1500346083, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037643164", "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 130, "last_played": 1500344912, "playtime_forever": 45}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34103124", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502653", "review": "The premise behind this game is basically the same of \"Shadow of Colossus\",the quality of the pixel graphics and animations is good and the game flows really well,the game is a little bit on the short side,but considering it's low price and overall quality, it's short lenght is negligible.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502197943, "timestamp_created": 1502197943, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160868511", "num_reviews": 265, "num_games_owned": 433, "last_played": 1502202760, "playtime_forever": 121}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34364512", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501586", "review": "It's a neat little game with good graphics, but it's pretty easy. I beat the normal game in about 50 minutes and only died once on the last boss.\n\nIt seems there is some kind of end game content. Something new appeared on the screen, but, like everything else in this game it doesn't explain what it is. At the start they give you the basic controls and that's it, although the rest isn't very hard to figure out.\n\nA few gripes I have is that each enemy only has a couple different attacks bar the last enemy. Once you learn their attacks, fights are a breeze, especially when you're packing a heal spell that heals you for 50% of your health. I think the heal should be lowered or maybe give you a limited amount, otherwise it's dodge and heal, swipe enemy a few times then dodge and heal again. Also, the monsters have a bad habit of landing on the outside of the screen where you can't attack and can't even see them or what move they are about to do.\n\nOne last thing, the last enemy is kind of a let down, it looks cool and moves cool but basically all it does is take the abilities of each other boss and use them against you.\n\nOverall it's fun enough for five bucks, just don't head in expecting the scope or strategy of Shadow of the Colossus.\n\nEdit: Apparently after you finish the main game, you unlock another few battles where you fight two of the bosses at once. Now this is incredibly hard. You hardly have anytime to attack because after you dodge one enemies attack, the other one comes at you. This seems like it was almost tacked on as an after thought. It's not about timing or reaction anymore, it's mainly luck. Just pray they don't happen to use certain moves that will lock you in place and not even give you a chance to block, just insta killing you.\n\nNot sure if there is anything else  unlocked after this, I died 2 minutes into the first fight. Also, the lack of a time trial mode seems like a massive oversight on the developer's part.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503202814, "timestamp_created": 1503200127, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010737305", "num_reviews": 65, "num_games_owned": 1057, "last_played": 1503202639, "playtime_forever": 100}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33584433", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498136", "review": "Fun short game with nice character designs.
