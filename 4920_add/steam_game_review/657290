I would recommend this game (^_^)/  by the way there isn't anything hot & heavy expect for kissing on the lips. The MC oh he was a riot xD & such a cutie and he got me laughing quite a bit.

The main character is an archvillain's protege who is trying to make it into the big League--the League of Villains.  It's a M/M visual novel with two love interests.\n\n:: Pros ::\nCute story.\nAttractive character design.  The characters look like adults.\nNifty soundtrack - I actually paused on pages to listen to the complete loops.\nFunny bits involving Henchmen whose names you can never remember and sharks. \n\n:: Cons ::\nStory is too short. All achievements can be gained in under 4 hours, if you use skip function.\nYou can't name the character or his alias.\nOnly five or six uncomplicated choices on each story path.\nTypos. \n\nI wouldn't mind seeing more games from this developer, preferably with more sharks.  \n\n\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502036594, "timestamp_created": 1502036594, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048479010", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 102, "last_played": 1502034211, "playtime_forever": 248}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34451967", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509838", "review": "hey uhhhh i love this. a pretty short experience, i got about 4 hours out of it, but the characters are fun and the writing was enough to keep me engaged... also, it's nice to have a queer game that isnt as mundane as others usually are... the game focuses mostly on the story rather than the romance aspect, and the story is very fun; supervillainy? spies?
