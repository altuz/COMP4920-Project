I can say nothing! Because it doesn't work. I can't play it and can't write any review. It just crashes at start.\n\n\"Take On Helicopters\" starting well and my first impressions are positive. I like it! I like that in this game it's possible to get out of helicopter after landing and take a walk around location (pilot can walk, sit, lay down on earth, also he can swim in rivers). \n\nIt's possible to turn to any direction and look at everything you want (inside and outside helicopter).\nControls for me looks unusual and little bit difficult, but I've tried and did small flight which ended with lucky landing. I did flight around beatiful location and did some maneuvers (like barrel roll etc.). I found it very interesting."}]}
