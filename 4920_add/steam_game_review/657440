I really don't know how to describe it. Burn It Down is a Puzzle/Horror/Platformer Game. It'll test your brain, Creep the hell out of you and test your platforming skills. The catch to that is. The game only uses two buttons. Left and Right. To be honest...That's all it needs. It uses those controls to absolute perfection. You only have one hour to beat the game. During while you have to build momentum to have your character automatically jump over gaps or slow yourself down so you don't jump head first into a wall of spikes and make sure to do it FAST. Otherwise something may catch up to you. Overall the game keeps you with a light chill down your spine most of the game and feels great to control with the few buttons it uses. For the price I'd say pick it up whenever you can. It's an experience you won't regret. Just a warning though. The game is hard as balls.\n\nFinal Score\n----------------\n7/10", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502203313, "timestamp_created": 1502203313, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051794117", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 363, "last_played": 1502202670, "playtime_forever": 54}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34028684", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501331", "review": "Neat platformer deffinatly worth the price, discount unneeded lol. the timer really puts you end edge 10/10 would say \"stfu im comming bitch!\" again . though i do not know if she is suppose to appear by chance or if it bugs out if you die and she might not show.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501900687, "timestamp_created": 1501900687, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198074943289", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 136, "last_played": 1501900012, "playtime_forever": 146}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33999154", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497338", "review": "I used to be #2 in the world back when this game was on mobile, but now there are quite a few new levels.
