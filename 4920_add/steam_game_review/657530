It wants you to feel out the mechanics but the mechanics are non-obvious enough and they're only ever introduced the moment you need them to solve a larger puzzle. Like, you get to the third area and everything is fine but unless you can work out what the mechanic introduced in that section is you will end up completely stuck; yet once you figure it out the solution is really easy. The game also mixes self-contained areas with the overall game map in ways that are kind of annoying - this is seen again primarily in the third and last areas, with all the other areas being completely self-contained, making it hard to figure out what the game intends when you're not sure if you're stuck because you don't understand the current puzzle or just because you need to do something in a different area. And as well, the final puzzle is... a super tedious and overly long fetch quest that requires no thinking, it's just \"find the specific painting you need out of about 10 and put it in the correct room out of 10\" about a dozen times. And the ending is very unsatisfying when you do reach it, as a result.\n\nGripes aside though the puzzles themselves are clever and the game does instill that \"aha\" moment all good puzzle games should strive to create. Seeing all the pieces fit in to place (when you understand how they work) makes solving puzzles actually feel like an accomplishment (well, again, except for that last one) and due to the non-euclidean nature of the game map it's hard to tell how much is left to explore until you get close to the end (at which point you have basically been everywhere except for the very final room). It's also kind of exhausting to play though, since it requires both logical thinking and working out the game mechanics at the same time. It's not a long game, took me under 5 hours to beat and knowing what you're doing perfectly I bet you could clear this in 10-15 minutes. And the mechanics themselves are kind of clever too, it certainly doesn't feel much like any other game I've played. Yes, it's very aesthetically similar to antichamber, and it's non-euclidean as well, but the games don't have any similarities beyond that.\n\nFor the price I'd say it's worth it, it's not a perfect game and can be a bit frustrating at points but it's still pretty enjoyable and doesn't overstay its welcome much. Again, though, that end section is really dumb, I have no clue what they were thinking there.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502435807, "timestamp_created": 1502435807, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198076721797", "num_reviews": 417, "num_games_owned": 670, "last_played": 1502435316, "playtime_forever": 262}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33862809", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499198", "review": "Graphics leave a little bit more to be desired but the unique mechanics make it worth your while.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501355202, "timestamp_created": 1501268282, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198209556341", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 21, "last_played": 1501278655, "playtime_forever": 79}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34000368", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498592", "review": "Very impressive little puzzle game from a lone developer.

Then for the next hour, it won't. And for the final remaining hour, it'll infuriate/bore you. It brought something new to the table, then it ruined itself with two annoying levels.\n\nPart of the fun of Impresja is discovering the mechanics, as the game only tells you that you can move around with WASD, interact with the mouse buttons, and that the game saves automatically; after that it chucks you straight into the puzzles and you have to figure out what to do with it all. So I won't spoil what the big mechanics of the game are. However, it's very much related to non-Euclidean levels (which we all love!), and does produce a few nice puzzles based around it. I'll say this much, though: you can take paintings and put them onto easels and walls, and this does certain things things.\n\nThe first two puzzles were challenging and enjoyable. They stuck to themselves and didn't try to mislead the player. They presented a situation involving the mechanics of the game, and required logical reasoning to get through. The mechanics themselves were also presented clearly and were fairly-introduced. This is good. The developer should read this and keep that in mind for the next game.\n\nThe bad level design starts to show in the next puzzle, however. This one's in two parts, and both have annoying red herrings that have no bearing on the puzzle whatsoever, but are instead put there for you to seemingly waste your time on. Let's just say this: in this game, pillars can be reconfigured in certain ways, but in both parts of this third puzzle, a great deal of these pillars *look* as though they should be configured in one way (involving point-of-interest A), whereas in fact point-of-interest A isn't part of the solution to the puzzle. At all. And the pillars that are *actually* used are a different set from the ones in the point-of-interest A configuration. Why not simply *remove* point-of-interest A, and the unnecessary pillars?! Red herrings in a game are almost always unfair! Even worse, the actual solution to the puzzle involves using something that *isn't* a pillar to connect the two parts, which is completely counter to one's expectations.\n\nFurther, at this point, the fact that you HAVE to place paintings onto specific points on the wall (and never on the floor) means that in this puzzle, you'll end up wandering around trying to find the one specific spot on the wall where you can place a painting so that you can free up your hands to shuffle paintings back and forth. Combined with the slow walking speed and long passageways, this becomes a bit of a chore. Oh, and you also have to backtrack all the way through the first and second levels to solve this one. I would *never* design a level that took this long to complete or which mislead the player this badly. While it's cool that the puzzle *does* use elements from the previous levels, the problem with backtracking is that it takes too long to get through those previous levels.\n\nEither way, supposing you do indeed manage to solve that level, you're then presented with a fairly easy puzzle next. A puzzle that in fact would have fit perfectly as the first puzzle in the game, were it not for the inter-level interplay. Though now that I say that, I'm not entirely convinced about it; it feels to me like restructuring the game to make that the next puzzle would actually be a lot easier than I initially thought. Either way, this puzzle was still enjoyable and I'll praise the developer for it.\n\nSo now you're at the fifth puzzle, which introduces its mechanic well and is fun. Again, praise to the developer for this one, huzzah!\n\nThen you get to the sixth puzzle. And this is where the level design goes straight out the window. This puzzle involves a circular corridor, with entrances on the inside of the corridor leading into rooms, and one-way drops on the outside coming from... well, that's one issue. Only one of those one-way drops can actually be accessed; the rest are all useless and probably shouldn't be there. But more pressingly, there are a total of 8 rooms on the inside of the corridor, and you have to move paintings between these rooms to complete the puzzle (and finish the game). The problem is that you can't see what's in these rooms until you're right in front of the entrance, and with the slow walking speed it takes ages to get from one room to another. Further, moving the wrong painting to the wrong room is a mistake and will likely need to be undone.\n\nThe way *I* would have designed this level is to instead have the circular corridor be a central room, with exits leading out to the 8 rooms. The one-way drop could be a drop from the ceiling, and the main exit out from the corridor could be marked differently. That way, the player can see all the rooms at once and can see what's in each room, so there's now no need to run around the corridor for literal minutes, trying to find the right painting and the right room.\n\nEven having done that, the puzzle itself is still pretty tedious and probably needs to be nerfed. Basically, moving the paintings allows you to move the statues in the rooms from one room to another. The problem is that they need to be moved in a specific order between rooms, and there's only ever one statue-less room to move a statue into.\n\nDespite all this ridiculousness, I was still hoping for more good quality puzzles after this one. But then the game ended straight after, leaving me unsatisfied and wanting more puzzles with good level design. Why couldn't you have had more puzzles based on the mechanics of the first two?! I really liked those puzzles; they showed such promise and got me to really think about them! Instead, you gave me puzzles that were overcomplicated and badly-presented. The difference between the good puzzles and the bad is quite truly night and day here.\n\nAt the time of writing, the other negative reviewer on this game thinks that the developer forgot to have their game playtested. I think it's definitely possible that the four levels I mentioned that were good WERE playtested, because they were honestly good levels; they were well-thought-out and were fun. But I can't help but feel that the other two puzzles *didn't* have playtesters test them, and so the game's suffered badly as a result. Had those two levels been cut out entirely, I wouldn't just give this a positive rating; I would wholeheartedly recommend this to my puzzler friends.\n\nIn short, Impresja is a good and ambitious game at heart, but 1/3 of its levels mar it with overcomplicated design, red herrings, and bad presentation. It has good mechanics and good introductions to the mechanics, but fails to follow through with enough good levels to match. Get it only if you have a lot of patience.\n\nIf the developer is willing to completely replace the offending levels, I'd be very happy to update this review as required, because I really really wish this game were better and did well as a result. But as it is now, it's a \"Not Recommended\" from me.\n\nEDIT: Also, shame on the developers of Flow Match (now known as Soko Match) and Rolling Shapes, because their games are literally Satan's diarrhoea.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504226229, "timestamp_created": 1504225279, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051304382", "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 468, "last_played": 1504217451, "playtime_forever": 178}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34044516", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494657", "review": "I think the dev forgot to have their game playtested is the thought I was left with after playing.\n\nYou're dropped in without any explanation of how the mechanics work. This leads to trial and error from the get-go and this trend continues upon progression.\n\nNow, I appreciate the surreal look of the game and the unique gamepaly, unfortunately it becomes too abstract for its own good. You're trying to grasp your head around pairing paintings in order to create paths so that you can get a guarded painting out in order to pair it with something else and create an exit, but certain combinations make loops and things can get convoluted. This can be especially seen when there are more than a couple branching paths leading to multiple rooms within a section (by section I mean an area with new music).\n\nThe first two sections aren't that bad, but upon entering the third section the difficulty spikes up and you're left to move around trying even more cominations over and over. \n\nTo add to injury you cannot run. While the character doesn't move that slow, the feature would of been nice to have. Also, do those hallways in the infinity room really need to be that long?\n\nIn essence, as said before, the abstract nature of the game (while nice to look at) ultimately seems to detract from the gameplay. The surreal mechanics along with their combinations can create a mental block which leads to alot of trial and error.\n\nAfter solving the first two areas I had a slight idea of what I was doing, but when the path opened up I still didn't know how it came to be.\n\nLastly, I don't know if the gameplay stays the same but it does get monotonous moving paintings over and over after a while with the fact that paintings can only be hung on an empty space. I can only assume the are more colors but that's about it...\n\n", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501960231, "timestamp_created": 1501960231, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198135955496", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 27, "last_played": 1501956295, "playtime_forever": 157}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
