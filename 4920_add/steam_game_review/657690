Well worth the wait, and the price.\n\nYou play captain, with a nameable crew who are setting sail for the caribbean island of Nassau. On the way you encounter reefs, storms and other ships which can make or break your voyage. Running Low on food? Stop for a bit of spear fishing. Need some supplies? Trade with other ships you encounter on the way. Pirates? Well, aim your cannons and click away in a firefight, to the victor go the spoils. All to an 8-Bit pirate shanty soundtrack. (Real Sea Shanties btw) \n\nAfter multiple playthoughs I have enjoyed a unique voyage each time. As you play you build XP, unlocking larger ships to use on your future voyages. Paired with that you have a choice of class, allowing you to trade some of your starting gold supply for score multiplier, and adding more challenge.\n\nAll in all Caribbean Sail is a fun pick up game when you just need to play something diffrent. And though it is most comparable to classic \"The Oregon Trail\" it is really an adventure all its own. I am very much looking forward to the updates planned for this game, and the future spots of bother that Cpt.Barbacoa and his crew will have to endure.\n\nAhoy,\nDuesFalchion", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505866855, "timestamp_created": 1505866525, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "steamid": "76561198072552706", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 120, "last_played": 1506043735, "playtime_forever": 165}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35077107", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505636", "review": "So what do you get when you take the Oregon Trail across the seas?\n\nYO HO HO AND A BOTTLE OF dysentery\n\nBut for real, you play a captain of a ship of people you can name after your friends.

The difficulty: I mastered the game in less than 30 minutes (adequate portions of food, harpoons to fish and fights every time you find a ship).\n2. The game is way too repetitive. After 2 or 3 playthroughs the joy and novelty are almost lost.
