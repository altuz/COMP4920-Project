Instead of giving you loose pieces like in the Incredible Machine, you're given complete tile sets each with several start and finish points that you have to piece together. It's a bit like the game 'the Mouse Trap'. The graphics are really well done and I genuinly like the look of the Whodos. You can also talk to the Whodos who will give you a tiny bit of back story about the mansion. You can pick up a limited number of items and use them to solve puzzles in the various rooms of the mansion. This gives the game some variety and prevents it from being just a string of puzzles.\n\n[b]Weak points[/b]\nHowever the story about what happened at the mansion as is promised on the storepage is merely mentioned once or twice instead of actually told. I still don't know what an automatician is, why Emma wants to be one, where the Whodos came from and what happened to the previous automatician. The game is also limited to the ground floor of the mansion and just as the puzzles where becoming slightly more difficult, I had solved them all. I had expected to do more puzzles in the rest of the mansion so hopefuly that will be added in DLC. The Rube Goldberg puzzles are fun but in the end I discovered they were actually easier than I thought. You're given a limited number of \"puzzle pieces\" at the start of the level. And you have to use those puzzle pieces to connect the start and end tile. In the beginning you need to use all puzzle pieces just to get from start to finish. But I managed to solve the final puzzle using only three of the five available pieces. I thought you were supposed to use all of them, so I spent a relative long time solving the previous three puzzles trying to fit all available pieces between start and finish. I probably could have solved them quicker by leaving out one or two pieces.\nThe game is played using keyboard and mouse and even though you can move Emma around using the gamepad, it's impossible to interact with anything. So gamepad isn't really supported and probably only responds because it's part of the Unity engine they've used. Also you can press the Tab key to open up your inventory and notes. I thought I'd mention it here since you won't find that piece of information in the game itself. \n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Short, feels like a demo to a full game\n[*]Not much story\n[*]Relatively simple puzzles\n[*]No support for gamepad\n[*]No big secret at the end\n[/list]\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Smooth graphics\n[*]Whodos have lots of character\n[*]Puzzles are fun to play\n[*]Cheap\n[/list]\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nWhile it doesn't feel like an early access game, since it runs smoothly and I've found no bugs or glitches, it feels incomplete. The game doesn't deliver on the promises done on the store page. The story is only partly told and there is no big reveal at the end. [spoiler]After finishing the final puzzle the Whodos tell you that you are worthy to do more puzzles and maybe even become the next automatician.[/spoiler] I hope they end up adding more puzzles to the rest of the mansion and actually tell the whole story.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500964437, "timestamp_created": 1500964437, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017392185", "num_reviews": 117, "num_games_owned": 3097, "last_played": 1500962312, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33779572", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "review": "So I was able to beat the game pretty fast, I'll keep it around for any posible extending to the story.
