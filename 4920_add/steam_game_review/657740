I enjoyed my time with [i]Ballistic Attack[/i]. Yet I was bored at the same time. Why is that? And could I really recommend the game after that?\n\n[i]Ballistic Attack[/i] is a really basic tower defense. There is a single lane, and monsters charge towards a penthouse that looks like there might be a Halloween party in there.\n\n[h1]You put guns in their way, because they are not invited[/h1]\n\n(Actually there's no story at all, but I liked to imagine that reason.)\n\nThere's a diverse set of towers: single-shot, double-shot, heavy-shot, fast heavy-shot, super-fast heavy-shot... Actually they looked more diverse on the screen. There's over ten towers with increasing prices. Each one can be upgraded for increased fire rate, damage and range. No buff- nor debuff-towers exist.\n\nOne thing that stroke funny was that there's no gradual unlocking of towers as the campaign progresses. Everything is there from the beginning.\n\nIf you can afford it, that is. [i]First you can't[/i], because early mobs don't give enough cash for that. So, the progression is kind of emergent as later you get more cash.\n\nI was expecting air units at some point, because there is an anti-air cannon. But they never appeared, so I never built one. I think that cannon had a confusing name.\n\nInstead, once in the later levels (like halfway through the game's 10 levels) I could buy my first plasma turret.\n\n[h1]It was awesome.[/h1]\n\nPlasma turret simply mows through everything. Nothing could get past it; not weak mobs, not heavily armoured giants - not even the fast slithering alligator things, because it simply shoots so fast.\n\n[h1]...too awesome.[/h1]\n\nPlasma turret is OP as hell. Every level would be won after you got the funds to build one. Then it became boring waiting until the level ended. Unfortunately, it basically ruined the game for me.\n\n[h1]End of line[/h1]\n\nAfterwards, I feel that because of the overpowered cannons, the game was just too easy, as well as short. Its ten levels lasted a mere hour.\n\nWhat could have saved it? Maybe additional challenges, e.g. through interesting achievements. The current achievements are basically earned by completing levels. Perhaps adding something like \"Beat the level X without building plasma turrets\" or \"Beat the level Y without turret upgrades\" could have helped it.\n\nBtw, it does not have Trading cards, despite Store page claiming so, at least not yet.\n\nIt's a fine game for its price for an achievement hunter/completionist. It just isn't much anything else.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502922243, "timestamp_created": 1502921802, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001046455", "num_reviews": 135, "num_games_owned": 7088, "last_played": 1502840037, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33644852", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508626", "review": "Ballistic Attack doesn't really seem like much from the trailer, but it's a genuinely fun, casual little tower defense game.
