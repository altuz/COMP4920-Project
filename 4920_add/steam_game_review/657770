If you don't want to spoil the intense gameplay and story you should definitely not hover over the text below. /s (< means sarcasm, because there's no story or gameplay, the spoiler is just here because I don't want to ruin your experience of this top quality indie game.)\n\n[spoiler]There's not much to say about this game, it's exactly what it claims to be, a casual indie game with action.\nThe gameplay, of course, is simple. You start the game with only one available special attack, you kill enemies in the game to collect RNA, then RNA goes towards unlocking the rest of the special attacks, and that's about it.\n\nI'd assume every NPC in this game has 2 health, it takes 2 hits with a melee attack to kill an enemy, 1 hit with a gun, and 1 hit with your special attack, you use your special attack with RNA you collect from NPC's you kill, each R that is dropped from an NPC gives you 10 RNA, using your special attack requires 1 RNA, weapons do run out of ammo (which is fine when you practically have infinite special attack (I mean come on game, a random drop of 10 RNA from NPC's you kill and only 1 RNA to use your special attack?)).\n\nIf you kill an NPC, any NPC that notices the dead body will do probably nothing, I haven't really paid attention to what happens. If they feel as though something is wrong a question mark will appear above their head, if they see a dead body, the question mark will be replaced with an exclamation mark, I have no idea what that does. If a gun wielding guard spots a body, you will be shot on sight.\n\nYou have 16 health when you spawn, enemy attacks deal 1 hitpoint worth of damage, you pick up health packs (little squares with a + symbol in them) to get one health bar back.\n\nThe achievements are self explanatory, except for the ones that aren't self explanatory, but the ones that aren't you will end up getting by accident anyways so it's not a big deal. Though, 5 of the achievements are just severely tedious and not worth getting. You will know exactly which ones I'm talking about.\n\nThe gun you carry I can only assume is being held up and fired by your nipples, as your hands don't even touch it. The art style is, uh... Yeah.[/spoiler]\n\nThis is basically just a game to play when you want to kill some time, though it's only $0.99, it's not really worth that amount considering I've seen more free games with a significantly larger amount of content and gameplay, but whatever it's your money, go ahead and buy whatever 99 cent indie game you want buddy.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500436000, "timestamp_created": 1500436000, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139026997", "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 568, "last_played": 1500434217, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34511520", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486087", "review": "I don't understand this game.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503772392, "timestamp_created": 1503772392, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197966690836", "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 197, "last_played": 1503772373, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
