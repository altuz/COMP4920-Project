This game is no joke and gets extremely hard really quickly. The levels have the same spawns (time and location) every time so there is a slight element of memorization like an Ikaruga, but mostly this is just a reaction and dodging game. When an enemy gets close there is a very annoying noise. When playing using a Vive, the ship is aimed parallel to the control, meaning you have to aim the controller down like a magic wand. I wish they gave the option to aim the ship more like the angle of the head of Vive controller. To get the best score you need to kill enemies in groups of 4 which is interesting and does create a good meta challenge on top of just completing the levels without dying. The various enemies have made it very challenging and require significant movement just by level 12 of 40. I'm still enjoying the game and will likely keep playing on and off They made a pretty big improvement but there still seems to be some performance issues as shown at https://youtu.be/Zxfk8KVXJWI?t=2347.

Spartaga is a neat arcade game of the bullet hell genre, a nice change from first person shooters. The combo system adds another layer of gameplay that really makes it interesting and engaging, especially when you're trying to shoot a specific enemy while dodging the lasers, bullets, and chasers. It definitely keeps you moving around and reacting to enemies.\nThe enemies are easily recognizable by their colors and shapes, and so are the projectiles, making it so that you know what went wrong.  What goes on in the background also fills the atmosphere nicely as you're listening to the music. The ability to change how your ship, your shots, and the background looks is also great, but it's lacking variety unlike the enemies. \nThe 27 enemies really do feel like they're all different from each other, unlike some other VR games where enemies are just reskins of each other. Shooters,shotgunners, chasers,bombs(sorta), lasers, turrets, tanks,etc., all make the levels quite a lot more exciting.\nI haven't tried the marathon yet, but I really love the game(heck yeah 20+ hours and counting). Somewhat of a completionist, I try to complete the challenges(speedy,pacifist, and elite) that the game provides, and I don't find it repetitive. The challenges never feel impossible, but they can be quite daunting.\nSpartaga 1.02", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506237821, "timestamp_created": 1506237821, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 623, "steamid": "76561198082725740", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 17, "last_played": 1506850649, "playtime_forever": 2364}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
