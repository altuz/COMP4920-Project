Great\nYou like Shooting? Perfect\nYou wanna Hack and Slash? We have that too\n\nDungeon Defenders is a strategy 3D tower defense. I personally love the tower defense genre, but to make a game that add classes and stats to change the way the game is played was outstandingly amazing to me. I first played this game on the xbox and was instantly captured by the game. Later on the game released on steam and along with it DLC I had never seen before. I remember when the jester first came out, you could place only presents, that was it. Every strategy almost always ends up having either the monk, the summoner, or both. For the auras the monk gives and the extra towers the summoner uses, who wouldnt use them?\n\nI don't play it a whole lot anymore but this game is one of my all time favorite games to play. \n\n10/10 will defend again and again"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505328915, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502500", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34925263", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197992725068", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1507048553, "num_games_owned": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2848, "playtime_forever": 7842}, "timestamp_updated": 1505328915, "received_for_free": false, "review": "fun co-op games with plenty of challenges"}, {"votes_down": 31, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504737008, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438865", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "34784294", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961664814", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1386916958, "num_games_owned": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 110}, "timestamp_updated": 1504737008, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Within 30 minutes of getting the game a random stranger gave me the best gear in the game and ruined the grind for me."}]}
