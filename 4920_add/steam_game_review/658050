For a first effort and for the price, Dragons' Twilight is a definitely a game worth checking out.\n\nThe maps are a bit sparse and there are a few grammatical/capitalization errors. However, what the developer does do with the more limited game map is fairly impressive. Never did I feel like there wasn't enough to explore.  The story also  is quite engaging with some rather decent character development. This development does fall away a bit toward the latter part of the game, particularly with the introduction of more characters. I actually found myself wanting to know more about certain characters and their connections to one another.\n\nI think one area where the game does shine is in the \"no grinding.\" Grinding, in these games, is often a gratuitous way to extend the game. Sprawling, maze-like dungeons are common and commonly detract from the overall game and story. That is not the case with Dragons' Twilight. Each dungeon area serves its purpose with none of the dreaded \"when will this end\" feeling you get in many games where, as the game goes on, dungeons become longer and more tedious. This lack of massive dungeons and lack of a need for grinding is incredibly refreshing.\n\nAnother area where this game shines is in the skills and magic features. Magic is attained not by leveling up, but by equipping different tomes. The same goes for skills, which are only attained based on the type of weapon and the gear that characters can equip. This makes the choices for what gear to equip, along with what party members to include far more interesting and flexible. Where one character might work wonderfully in one dungeon area, he/she might be a detriment in the next.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. It's by no means perfect, but it is quite engaging.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505534216, "timestamp_created": 1504697300, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2671, "steamid": "76561198045895911", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 530, "last_played": 1506504935, "playtime_forever": 11047}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35141399", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505225", "review": "I am a fan of RPG Maker games, but I normally played those that have steam achievements.\nAlthough this game does not have steam achievements, I bought it due to the low price of under $2, but did not have high expectations. I just thought that it was another average, low price game to spend a boring evening.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised!!! This game is beautifully made, with a very interesting storyline that keep you guessing who the bad guys were. Furthermore, when you follow the initial storyline, you get to play and see events through the eyes of different heroes, and also learn their specific strengths and abilities. This particular game also have an interesting twist in term of spells and special abilities. You need to find and equip yourself with different spell books (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light and Dark) of different levels (ranging from Level 1 Spellbooks to Master level Spellbooks). The spells that a player can cast is not attached to a particular team member, but they are attached to spellbooks. This means that you can strategize and trade these books to various team members. Similarly, special abilities are attached to weapons instead of being learn by party members. So wielding different weapons will enable the same party member to have different sets of special abilities. Hence, spells and abilities are novel in that they are attached to objects instead of people. I love it.\n\nI have played about 15 hours but am still not close to the end. I am at the point where I can enter the final battle. However, I am a completionist, and would like to get all the best tomes (spells), legendary weapons and best armors in the entire game. Interestingly enough there is an NPC that is close to the final battle to tell you what BEST items you are missing, the quests that are involved, and the location where these items can be found. Currently none of my items (spellbooks, weapons and armors) are among the BEST, and I realised that I have another 10-20 interesting sidequests to do instead of jumping into the final battle. Well, I might not even survive the final battle if I do not do all these sidequests. In retrospect, I enjoyed these game very much because there are many interesting things to do still.\n\nI wrote this review because I only see 1 review for this game, and would like to recommend this game to other RPG gamers. I will also update my review when I finished getting all the top tier items, and finished the game.\n\nFor under $2, such an interesting and high quality game is definitely worth it.!!!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506130502, "timestamp_created": 1506130148, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1209, "steamid": "76561198011891156", "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 758, "last_played": 1506162906, "playtime_forever": 1209}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35220416", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Just a little classic RPG with an interesting story, charming characters, lovely art and at least a good 12 hours of fun. \n\nGlad I purchased it and hoping to see more from this developer!", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506439983, "timestamp_created": 1506426607, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 877, "steamid": "76561198079501054", "num_reviews": 32, "num_games_owned": 831, "last_played": 1506426347, "playtime_forever": 877}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35232071", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "This game is remarkably good. The art is clean and well-drawn, the music is catchy and the sound effects are unobtrusive. The turn-based gameplay and puzzles are forgiving (death isn't permanent unless you make some really bad dialogue choices). If you grind enough, the difficulty is manageable.
