While I wasn't insanely impressed with the selection of levels set out for you in order to progress normally, all of the side content unlocked through collection really rewarded a player's dedication to finding secrets. The gameplay is smooth, and rewards skillful boomerang play; mastering mechanics is key to succeeding in this game. Aside from the gameplay itself, the music is enjoyable, and fits very well for the cartoon-y atmosphere. It's the same case for the SFX, with a heavy use of xylophones to truly give off the cartoon skeleton vibe. My only real gripe with the game is that I can't seem to find out what I'm supposed to be doing with the Bone Chips (I guess in a sense they're like coins if it were a Mario game, but there's no stored lives, so they seem kind of useless).\n\nOverall, the smaller components of this game stack up to make a much more fun experience, and I reccomend that if you were to play this game that you actively sought out all of the collectible items.

Also the music is freakin' AMAZING, It has truly captured the perfect sound for the game. The pixel graphics are great too, and while they are relatively simple the ooze style. Once you unlock a few new boomerangs and skills and start developing your own style, a rhythm emerges in the game, and you might find it difficult to stop.
