Granted, Clicker Heroes was never greedy about their micro transactions, but they were always there. \n\nClickRaid offers two things to pay for, the base game and a DLC that makes your cursor shiny, as well as supports the dev. I think it also increases the odds of encountering Raid Bosses, which is a good thing. \n\nPersonally, I hope the dev offers more DLC for the game, not micro transactions. More little knick-knacks to support the dev as well as pimp my cursor even further. Who knows. \n\nSo what's the biggest difference between this one and all the other clickers? \n\n[b]Hello? Is there anyone out there?[/b]\n\nMany clicker games are single player. Some of them do a little extra, Clicker Heroes has what is basically a message board that your guild can use, though it's extremely limited. Worse yet, messages are limited to one per 30 seconds or something like that. It makes having a conversation with the guildmates quite frustrating. \n\nClickRaid has guilds AND a live chat, which is a core focus of the game itself. You can chat to the whole world, or you can chat to the party you're in. \n\n[b]Did I forget to mention multiplayer is super important?[/b]\n\nThe party system is really a server system. One person hosts, 4 others can join their game. Each time you encounter a Raid Boss, other players all receive Raid Souls, which are one of the games' upgrade points. Additionally, in later levels, there are classes which provide speed and damage bonuses, increased experience, increased souls, faster hero damage, etc. If you have 5 different classes in the same room, you'll find your bonuses get buffed to high heaven. \n\nThis is awesome.\n\n[b]Should you buy the game, though?[/b]\n\nIf you're a clicker fan, as I am, then yes... yes you should. You should stop reading this and buy the game immediately. It's worth the very modest price of it and its \"Supporters\" DLC. You'll get thousands of hours out of it currently, and the dev is updating the game like [i]crazy[/i]. \n\n[b]Seriously, stop reading this and buy the game, you're wasting time.[/b]\n\nDon't read this review anymore, you could already be up a few hundred levels by now.\n\n\nSTOP READING THIS!!! GO PLAY!!!
