All fights take place on various different maps in a simulated environment and hence justify the abstract visuals (just blocks and simple shapes). However after you have qualified in the simulated environment a final \"real\" world level can be accessed (I try not to spoil it for you so I don't give more details).\n\nThe game follows a well thought-out plot and thus constructs a very plausible explaination for the offered gameplay, graphics and mechanics. I really enjoyed playing the arenas and getting better to prepare for the final level. There are many weapons which all have a different feel than other weapons in VR games (that aim to represent real world guns), but for me that is okay. Each weapon can have multiple attachments/upgrades which need to be unlocked by achiving kills with already unlocked attachments. This adds motivation to replaying already finished maps. There are many different maps and some of them you enjoy and want to play again while others can be forgotten once you finished them. But since all maps are nicely done I'm sure the ones I didn't like can be enjoyed by others with different taste and play style.\n\nIn summary I'm quite impressed how nicely all components of this game fit together and add up to a complete game! Given that the whole game was developed by a single person and it is sold at a very fair price with even a demo available (which I tried before purchase), I have to recommend it to everybody interested in this type of game!\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506460844, "timestamp_created": 1506460844, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 114, "steamid": "76561198013020097", "num_reviews": 35, "num_games_owned": 810, "last_played": 1506457178, "playtime_forever": 186}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
