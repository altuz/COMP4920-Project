Moreover, Gust, as usual, has delivered really good soundtracks.\n\nAnimation is fine, not at top-notch but stays acceptable as it is similar to other Gust games such as Atelier series or Nights of Azure.\n\nBattle system is classic turn-based system, with some enhancements such as using skills to \"knock-back\" your opponent's turn to 1 turn later.\n\nStory, as other Gust's games, is enjoyable and relaxing.\n\nTo conclude, BLUE REFLECTION is a good JRPG, and definitely not a bad port as from what were mentioned.

You have to like turn based RPGs\n2. You have to like the Mahou Shoujo/\"Magical Girl\" aesthetic (Sailor Moon, Madoka, etc.)\n3. You have to like gratuitous Yuri/Lesbian overtones\n\nThe game's strengths are its clean UI, its simple but strategic battle system, and its faithful adaptation of a tonal \"magical girl\" story. You can think of this game as a \"low budget Persona 3/4/\", essentially.\n\nWhere the game falters, and prevents itself from becoming truly \"great\", are in how its \"dungeons\" are very weakly designed with few motivations for exploration and continued combat, its poor in-game camera, and its lacking difficulty (playing the game on \"hard\" helps, barely).\n\nLet's also not forget the ridiculous $80 season pass this game has launched with. And the $53 price tag. The publisher clearly has no idea what it's doing with PC games, especially since I only heard about this game the day before launch.\n\nFor $15 to $20, this game is a \"steal\" - you aren't going to find a mahou shoujo RPG in English anywhere else, and if you are onboard with my three caveats above, you should love this game. \n\nI'd like to see more games like these brought into English, and the game genuinely looked unique, which is why I was comfortable paying close to full price for it. It's not Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, its battle system is trying to do something different, and I think it mostly works. Plus, the more personal narrative this game offers is something I prefer for a game to have, so I was able to justify paying way above what this game is honestly worth. This is a game to buy when it's really on sale.\n\nThis is a budget jRPG trying to do something different so it still deserves props for that.\n\nNow, with that all out of the way, I do have to admonish the game for...Well, it's to be expected, right? A young female character NOT being sexualized in any manner would surprise me more than anything. And the ridiculous amount of lesbian overtones in this game is borderline funny and not offensive. The fact you can go on DATES with your female classmates really takes the cake for me and bridges the comparison to Persona 3/4/5 further. \n\nBut was it really necessary to give us bath scenes? Scenes where our protagonist walks in the rain, so her bra can bleed through her blouse? Are details like that really necessary? It's a little creepy, or at least it hurts the serious tone the story tries to take in places. The story here is something you can take mildly seriously, at least for a mahou shoujo, and some of the oversexualization here really undermines that. I mean, mahou shoujo are sexual enough without the additional stuff here, just look at those costumes... I wish they'd exercised a little more restraint, and kept the fan service to a more sporadic level. Instead, it's literally everywhere. But this is an East vs West audience expectation thing. This game was clearly made for Japan, and I'm glad we got a localization of it. That nothing here was censored is great.\n\nIf you can handle everything I've described, I strongly reccomend this; it's a unique game.", "votes_down": 14, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506613330, "timestamp_created": 1506613330, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 525, "steamid": "76561197999487140", "num_reviews": 52, "num_games_owned": 143, "last_played": 1507088859, "playtime_forever": 525}, "votes_up": 48, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35225880", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523449", "review": "Magical Japanese school girl lesbians, what more could you want.", "votes_down": 24, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506739794, "timestamp_created": 1506445629, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 383, "steamid": "76561198018360268", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 132, "last_played": 1506831841, "playtime_forever": 383}, "votes_up": 45, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35234093", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525256", "review": "I thought KT were up to their old tricks again after hearing about the 720p fiasco shortly before release but as I gathered more information I became more interested in the details of what's going on. I'm going to try to focus on specifics here since other people have already mentioned stuff like editing the ini file (in My Documents, KoeiTecmo folder) to bump resolution and possibly enable AA though I haven't tried the latter through the ini yet.\n\nTo start off with a tl;dr: This is a decent port that is most definitely NOT the Vita version, which that version has much of its visual effects cut.\n\nIf you want to see screenshot comparisons between PC and PS4, there is a Steam Discussion thread made for this: \"PC vs PS4 comparison screenshots\"\n\nI played through the first hour or so on PC while directly referencing a video of the game running on PS4 (Youtube \"Blue Reflection Gameplay Longplay\", video ID: X4J4iZTf1-g) and will comment on graphics with timecodes below (this overlaps with where the screenshots comparisons mentioned above cover but a bit more):\n\n- Bloom is present on both (3:05, 4:33, 7:52 for some reason more visible on PS4)\n- Depth of Field is present (togglable option on PC)\n- Shadow bugs are present in both but are at times slightly to significantly more visible in PC (5:48 hallway walking, the shadows under the windows shifting as well as some aliasing on the windows to the classrooms which are much more visible on PC, 24:30)\n- Shadow LOD popping present on both\n- Stair railing shadow map aliasing much more visible on PS4 than PC (7:29)\n- In ONE case I saw shadows missing on PC that are present in PS4 (12:04 and visible in one of the discussion screenshot comparisons)\n  - It should be noted in that case there are some severe issues with shadow LOD on the PS4 anyway as they disappear in horizontal strips as the camera moves.\n  - Otherwise every shadow that I've noted match between the platforms, including character dynamic shadows (53:10), self shadows (13:00, subtle), and background dynamic shadows (17:10)\n- The small outline around characters looks worse with PS4 though I suspect this is something that looks better as rendering res scales (37:55)\n- Generally texture quality seems to be equal on both platforms\n\nThis game doesn't have Borderless Windowed though seemingly works flawlessly with BorderlessGaming. Note that if you launch as Windowed at full monitor res it may require some finagling to actually force the game to be visible as it launches in a strange non-display state. In my case with multiple monitors it appeared on my higher resolution monitor and I had to use BG to fullscreen it, then remove the fullscreen to make it visible. From there, I simply dragged it into the correct monitor and re-fullscreened it. Single monitor users can likely just immediately use BG to fullscreen.\n\nThe game runs smoothly at 60 fps, this seems to be higher than the PS4, though that may just be an issue of referencing from Youtube rather than the actual console. From what I can see it seems like the 720p 2D assets referenced were mostly pre-rendered video (to save download size on a purely digital platform I suspect), tutorial/encyclopedia screenshots, and possibly some of the UI icons.\n\nThat all said, other people are reporting the usual gamut of issues such as instability. While I have not experienced this myself it isn't an uncommon occurrence so I can't say definitively that this port doesn't have major issues for everyone, but so far as I am able to tell it seems above average for KT, especially if we can get a few patches for people who are experiencing stability issues.\n\nEdit: After just over 2 hours, I did run into a crash while transitioning areas right after completing a mission so holding for a patch does def seem prudent, save often", "votes_down": 10, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506492029, "timestamp_created": 1506479655, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "steamid": "76561197971592520", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 1125, "last_played": 1506492166, "playtime_forever": 150}, "votes_up": 23, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35233337", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517693", "review": "I used to wonder what \"bad PC port\" meant. Now I understand! It's like running a PS4 emulator on your PC. A really good one. But you can tell that it isn't quite doing things the native PC way, and if you're used to emulators, you know it means that you'll only run it about 40% as good as the source platform. I have a GTX1080 and I wouldn't have expected it to run well on anything slower if it was that kind of port, and I don't think it's necessarily the developers' fault, if they started making the game without knowing they'd port it someday then they might not have chosen a viable engine option from the get-go. (It runs fine around 70FPS at 8K for me though (Yes, 8K), plus a bunch of manual antialiasing options in the NVIDIA driver.)\n\nWith that nonsense out of the way, this is quite a unique game despite looking generic in the dungeon screenshots. I'm sure it looks like every other Atelier/Neptunia/etc game to you if you're a little jaded about these kinds of RPGs. But it has such a slow gentle pace that you might become surprsied. It's a pretty straight riff on the Persona series, except without all that jazz and rock and splashes of color making it extra cool and intense. Instead it's a very \"calm\" game, the other kind of cool - soft and low intensity and gently flowing. You glide between talking to your female classmates, getting to know them better, all to relaxing ambient music such as you might hear in Madoka, and every now and then you warp into a special area to battle demons and recover lost pieces of their souls.\n\nIt's a pretty standard anime plot, including the part about Madoka-esque demons taking over the world while everyone except a few girls scattered about the world are blissfully unaware. Instead of a demon fox handing out the contracts though, two of your classmates who look like twins and seem to know everything that's going on (and both look like they want to cuddle you to sleep), slowly dole out magic rings to you and your friends so that you can join forces and share magic and awareness of this alternate part of the world's events.\n\nThis game is CUTE. You have to know that and love that if anything is to seem extraordinary to you. The problems the characters face are just plain \"aww, shucks\" adorable, like someone who is afraid to be herself because she's too used to listening to what she's told to do. It feels good to her, but she wants to try expanding and feeling good about herself from the inside out, and you are the one to help her realize this. That's one of the least touching stories, really. I played the Japanese version before and it was definitely something that I couldn't wait to share with my English-speaking friends when/if it came out. (And it not only did, it did on PC! Sort of...)\n\nI still haven't gotten my controller working with this dumb butt of a port, but it was an opportunity to learn about Steam's built-in controller support and force the game to work with my controller anyway. There's lots of stupid things, like having to edit ini files to change your resolution reliably. But I think people are forgetting how amazing it is that just a year or two ago, PS3/PS4 ports were considered insane or impossible and everyone on forums and such insisted that the ones that weren't optimized for PC would be completely 100% unplayable. This is not unplayable. This is just... rough around the edges, early-alpha emulator style playable. If you really really want to play this game on PC and have one you spent more than $500 on in the last two years, it'll probably be fine, maybe not silky smooth but who cares.\n\nI definitely give this a recommend for the happy adorable thing it is. And anyone who wants it to be perfect, well I'm sorry for it not going well and I hope you can troubleshoot the game enough to be able to see what a fun time you could have anyway.

The overall plot follows a young girl named hinako who is dealing with the loss of her dream to be a ballet dancer due to a knee injury. After recovering from the injury she begins school where she encounters two sisters who give her the ability of a \"Reflector\" in order to fight demons in humanities collective unconscious. The game is somewhat similar in theme to persona, but rather than fight with the power of your \"other self\" you fight as a magical girl anime type character and become stronger through fragments of emotion you receive. Now then, onto gameplay, at its core is a fairly basic turn based rpg with a distinct leveling system. Rather than level up through fights you level by gaining fragments of emotion from \"Common\" and using them to increase stats, which in turn unlocks skills. You get these by resolving issues for other characters and through crafting them. Its a simple system, but it works well and deciding which stst to up can be difficult. Exploration is bare bones and doesn't feel wholly necessary outside of gathering crafting items. Overall tje gameplay falls into the average jrpg tier, nothing top notch but solid enough to stay interesting. The story is where the game truly shines, the plot is melancholic yet uplifting and the light, almost watercolor, color scheme really helps set the feeling of it all.
