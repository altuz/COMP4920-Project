It's an endless runner.  You have to collect little white balls and you have to avoid fallling down through the open floors of the tunnel by moving right or left quickly.  As time goes by and as you collect points, you move faster, thus increasing difficulty the longer you play.  I played this with an Xbox Controller and you either hit left or right on directional pad or the right or left shoulder buttons.  \n\nThere are 6 different environments, each with their own visuals, avatar, and music.  The visuals were adequate as was the music.  I was not expecting much and this game delivered.  The game ran smoothly.  It does keep track of your high scores, but I didn't see online leaderboards.\n\nSo do I recommend this game?  Ugh, I wish steam had a neutral option.  Personally, I didn't have fun.  However, this game delivered on exactly what it promised.  I have a real hard time knocking a game down when it does that.  \n\nI do disagree with the price point, especially since this same game is listed as $1.99 on the Oculus Store.  Even on sale, I can't recommend as it's definitely a .99 game given the content being offered.  \n\nRating 4.5/10 ... buy if you like this type of game, would change score if more features added or price lowered", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506055523, "timestamp_created": 1506055523, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1506054993, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
