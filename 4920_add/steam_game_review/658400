This game does not have many reviews yet nor many discussion which is quite surprising b/c it is actually a very good baseball simulation. I find it more accessible than OOTP and the menus are much simpler. OOTP is very complex and is a very good simulator but I give this a better rating due to its UI design. This game is a ton of fun. You build your team and sit back and watch it unfold. Very satisfying. There is a player mode in the game which allows you to select the pitch you want to hit or think the pitcher will throw (when batting) or it allows you to set location and type of pitch when pitching. I found this to be against the spirit of the management portion of the game. The idea is to become the manager not the player. Other games do player simulation quite well and this is no exception but this game is about management of a team or franchise not playing the game of baseball.\n\nThe managing side of the game is very good and the stats portion is immense and detailed. The batting averages of my players are just about matching real life stats with a few exceptions. The management option are numerous from setting ticket prices to concession prices to trading players and managing your own budget. Very good sim of the business side of baseball. Also love the headlines section that highlight things that have happened in various games and in various trades. Very cool feature.\n\nI do think some games have too many hits and the game favors hitting over pitching for sure probably to keep you engaged. Some of the games get out of control quickly and I find few of them are pitching battles.\n\nOverall this is a great baseball management simulator. I was pleasantly surprised and have no issues with recommending it to anyone who is even remotely interested in baseball.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent baseball simulator\n- Detailed management options\n- Trades / budget balance is excellent. You can't just get all of the best players and stay solvent.\n- Game are fun to watch unfold\n- Fast paced if you want, slower if you want\n- Good sound environment while the games are being played\n\nCons\n- Games appear to favor the hitter more than the pitcher\n- Far too many hits in games\n- Very few pitcher battle type games\n- Game tends to favor pitchers with velocity over pitchers with finesse and movement. Guess I can't fault the game for that since the modern MLB pitching focus seems to be more about velocity than hitting your spots.\n- Appears to be a pure Windows Forms based game. It does not go fullscreen and I don't think it is using any kind of hardware acceleration. Not really required for this type of game though so this is a very minor thing.\n- Crowds appear to cheer for both sides regardless of which staidum you are at", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506914033, "timestamp_created": 1506913513, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 634, "steamid": "76561197989410470", "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 586, "last_played": 1507195631, "playtime_forever": 634}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
