Speaking of those two, they get into some shenanigans of their own while the rest of the main cast goes off on another crazy adventure that ends in shooting alot of people and bringing a new character to join the academy. Overall, it is very much what I'm coming to expect from this series.\n\nAnd that... may be a problem. It isn't one yet, but I am wondering where exactly this series is headed. Just how many of these super-short, overpriced, but well-made, VN's are there going to be? Is there a \"main plot\" at work here, or is it going to stick to these short stories that are largely contained to each individual episode? How many more of these sorts of games can I play before I start to get bored? These are the sorts of questions that I am starting to ask. Paying $45 for 6-7 hours of gameplay is bad. Really bad. If this keeps up for too long, it may sour me on a series that, for now, remains one that I enjoy.\n\nStill, it was a neat short story that I don't regret playing. I'm just wondering... where is this plot going? Hopefully Vol 4 can provide some answers and shake things up a bit. Also I hope it is more than 2 hours long.\n\nYeargh...", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501925656, "timestamp_created": 1501925656, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197965049785", "num_reviews": 368, "num_games_owned": 594, "last_played": 1501927963, "playtime_forever": 184}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
