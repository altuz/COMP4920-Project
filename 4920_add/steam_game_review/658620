Subahibi kept me hooked in from the very beginning, and I only got more and more interested as I read on. The first episode starts slow, but is crucial to the story and has a fair bit of foreshadowing. \n\n\"It's My Own Invention\" and \"Looking-Glass Insects\" is where a lot of controversy about the game seems to come from, but every last disturbing detail services the plot. The story really shines in its narration style, in my opinion. I loved looking into the same timeframe and events from different perspectives, revealing more and more as I advanced. \n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic as well. Each song fits each scene perfectly, adding to the emotion whether it's fear, unease, melancholy, or happiness. A few of my personal favorites are \"Yoru no Himawari\" and \"Denpa Relay no Shousha.\"\n\nAll in all, out of the 40+ visual novels I've read, Subahibi comes out somewhere near the top. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants something more than light reading, that will require them to think, and is fine with the more disturbing areas of the story (which weren't actually as bad as I had been expecting).", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506105078, "timestamp_created": 1506105078, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037814488", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 180, "last_played": 1505987974, "playtime_forever": 2230}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34752094", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506212", "review": "I would like to add that this would be a review of the prolouge (Chapter 1) of the game. Nothing Spoilerly will be mentioned here. This is solely made in order to attract others who aren't sure if they want to pick this game up.\nLets go down the Basics, breaking it down into - Art, Sounds, characters, Interface, Story, Personal Enjoyment, Overall.\n\nArt - 7/10\nThis game came out in japan in 2010. The art, for the most part, is pleasent to look at. Anime fans will noticed the dynamic of the art is an older style. The in-game sprites are highly detailed, however, some may find it a little off given the art direction of the characters. It is a very colorful game with a darker lighting tone. Most of the CG's of the game are a bit weird. While the color, art and scenery comes to life, I wouldn't say the same for the perspectives. (This could be given off as artistic, but who knows). The backgrounds are also off putting. You can noticed some of the backgrounds characters aren't well designed or detailed. This is the same for the buildings and other details. They stand out alot compare to the main characters sprites. (Besides the sky, I like the Sky).\nOverall, not bad art, not perfect, but it gets the job done here.\n\nSounds 6/10\nThey are various soundeffects in this game that are out of placed. Might be because of the default settings, but the sound effects used in many of the scenes almost feels like they were taken from an older RPG game or RPG Maker. While not bad, I wouldn't call it proffesional. The music so far is a little forgettable. There were 2 tracks that gave me a great feel during the first chapter of the game and besides those original works. They did provided us with some Classicals! However, you can't skip them (far as I know) and it got annoying the first time around -.-\nOh and no Tittle music...why?\nOverall, Meh.\n\nCharacters - 7/10\nAll characters are going to fall into a \"Generic\" Trope. However, having this tropes is not bad writing, what is if they were generic or boring without much categorazation among their tropes. Having said this, I do belive they are all around that edge. I consider most of the characters to be that of a \"Generic\" Tsundere, \"Generic\" Mystery girl ETC. They do have that little spice in them but I think it doesn't warrants them any defining \"Personalities\". The only one that I found myself really enjoying is the Protagonist Yuki. I think she is a cool character. Her inner monologue and her reactions are great!\nOverall - Not bad. Yuki is awesome.\n\nInterface 4/10\nThe game has a neet interface. On the options menu you can see all of the important features. Nothing special about this window. The save and load feature are as standard as you can go. The overall Text window is basic enough with a cool feather as a decoration and to bring up the game's shortcuts, is as simple as slidding your mouse to the bottom. I do have TWO HUGE complains about the game for this category. 1. The voices do tend to cut off weirdly when transitioning between dialoge. I am the kind of VN reader that likes to have my voices on and have the freedom to move on whenever I am done reading the text, even if the voices aren't finish. Most visual novels I have played don't tend to lag up the game a bit when doing this or suddenly stopping it with a \"grain\" or \"Thub\" sound. 2. Never try to skip with the CTRL Key. I haven't tried with the space button, but unless you press the SKIP button to move forward on \"Already-Read-Text\" the game will skip all \"Unread-Text\". I found this out as i went back to choose from other choices and noticed something didn't add up at one point. This is a major minus for me but as long as you skip with the in-game Skip button, you should be fine.\nOverall - Generic, Poor.\n\nStory 10/10\nHere is the REASON why you want to play this game. The overall story can be confusing since they do quote back on older writers and have an interesting way of telling their ideas. It feels almost as if you were repeating your self or making sense of the unreasnable. But that is OK with this game. This game will get deep with you very fast I promised. The beginning and the ending of CH.1 have a great amount of story writing. Lots of Mysteries to go around! The middle part is mostly fluff. Really funny stuff and while I thought it got a little annoying, it was WAY worth it.\nOverall - I wish I could say more here, but sadly that would be getting into spoilers territory. Just belive me in this one.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment 9/10\nThe game itself for me was once of my highly anticipated game for a long time now. Once I found out it got released on steam I couldn't wait to play it! Had to wait for my paycheck of course but it was well worth every penny so far. I sat down and basically played it until I was finish with the first chapter. I love the characters in the game. While they are very \"Generic\" characters, the situation they were in were very funny. The interactions between the characters is explosive. It kept me giggling and laughing all throughout the middle sections of the story. The mysteries revealed were also a huge plus in my book here! Lots of great story telling! Nothing much i could say here.\n\nOverall - 10/10\nWOW hold on...10/10? This is actually crazy. The game Honesty does it best at the story. Art, Music, Interface and even the characters are all Subpar - Average level. But you don't pick this game up for any of those. You pick this game up simply because the story telling is GOOD. I haven't seen any game that shocked me as hard as it did during it's opening sequences. I've played many visual novels and this one nailed the beginning. It gives GREAT hopes for what's to come. If I were you, I would immediately pick this game up and play through Chapter 1. Give it a go. I know these kind of games aren't for everyone and some will disliked it or give it poor ratings. However one thing that we can't denied.\nIt has GREAT story Writing. And this always outweights any category.\n\nEDIT: On a Final note, I suggest choosing \"1\" or \"2\" instead of \"3\" for your first playthrough of CH1. I honesty think this gives people who read under the lines a better experience.
