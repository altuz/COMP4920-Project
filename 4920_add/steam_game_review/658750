The first time it restarted the language changed to Russian. The second time it stopped taking input at all. I had to keep clicking escape and going back to the main menu.\n\nThe beginning is not really challenging or fun, yet I had to play through it all after making small mistakes on the later parts. What's more, not all the update modules you get are good or make sense. There's an update for 'falling', an update for a death timer, and an update to break thin blocks, when there are only two thin blocks on the level and they conceal the update to break larger blocks, and nothing else.\n\nAll in all, it's the sort of game quality I'd expect to see from a good game jam result; sort of playable, you can appreciate the idea and get a sense what the devs are going for, yet still needing some elbow grease to be a finished product.
