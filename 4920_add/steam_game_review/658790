I wouldn't say it's similar, but it definitely reminded me of playing games like Double Dragon or Battletoads back in the day, just with better controls, nice artwork, etc.  If you like \"Beat 'em ups\" this one is worth the $15 IMHO and if it's on sale consider it a steal!\n\nBeing most games usually give an intro/tutorial on the controls (this one doesn't currently), I feel it's worth mentioning the PAUSE menu is your friend in this game.  It'll show you all sorts of combos (similar to newer Mortal Kombat games and their pause menu).", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505355461, "timestamp_created": 1505355461, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198204558367", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 352, "last_played": 1505514874, "playtime_forever": 119}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34972645", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505187", "review": "Loving this game so far! The music especially. It perfectly suits the vibe of the story and the pace of the gameplay. The controls are easy to grasp (though I know some people are still gonna say a tutorial would have been nice, and I was a little surprised there wasnt one, I found myself not missing it all that much). The art style is quite good, the sound effects are competent, and you can tell the devs really care about this labor of love. If you like beat em ups, youll love this game. If you like Samurai, youll love this game. If you like breakable set pieces with raccoons hiding in them, Youll ADORE this game. Highly recommended!", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505484345, "timestamp_created": 1505484345, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197991944157", "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 436, "last_played": 1505359290, "playtime_forever": 185}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
