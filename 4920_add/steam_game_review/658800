Is 6 colors a good news or not? Will it facilitate the game or will it complicate it?\n\nJust for reminder, this is how my review for the 14th game began.\n\n\"Fantasy Mosaics is a series of nonograms (also known as griddlers) games released for iOS and Android before being ported on PC and Mac. I know that because I've added the whole series on Neoseeker. That's why when I saw it on Greenlight, I voted yes, despite the fact that it's just puzzles after puzzles.\"\n\nAnd while it was the first game released on Steam, the 14th was coming from a long way, as it was introducting a fourth color. I don't know how it was before, so, the change of numbers was really experimented with the 16th game.\n\nAnd it's not really making the game easy unless two or three colors are just plain to place. However, I found myself to choose more often which tile is colored at the end, when the rest of the colors were placed correctly and don't give a clue to where to place the last tiles. It has worsened with the 17th game but before reviewing it, let's just speak about Six Colors in Wonderland.\n\nNothing really changed. In fact, it's just two colors added at once but the mechanisms aren't changing:  you have a series of numbers indicating how many tiles are used for a drawing in the column or in the line. Sometimes, it's easy as the whole line or column is concerned but at other times, it's really a matter of making your brain work: if for example, three tiles are needed and known, you know that the tiles just next to the beginning and the end can't be used for the column or the rest of the line.\n\nAnd that's it. 20 levels of 5 drawings, which means that I've solved 400 nonograms (yeah, I finished the 17th game and I've just bought the 18th), which I didn't realise until now. As usual, the plot isn't really developed for the penguin family. Besides, the 15 hours in the game is just showing that I've taken my sweet time... or reset puzzles because I'm challenging myself to have no mistake (and no use of hints). That challenge made me forget that bonus can be found under a colored tile: allowing more mistakes, hints and well, I didn't really pay much more attention. Besides, as far as I've seen, your \"garden\" or \"landscape\" is developing without needing a perfect score. Each level is rewarding you with an object, an animal, a structure or anything else. Sometimes, it's not even making sense but as we're clearly in a fantasy world, I suppose that it's making sense in that universe.\n\nThe drawings aren't really connected to each other but it's still great to discover them and to see if you managed to guess them or not.\n\nI can honestly say that Fantasy Mosaics 16 is a challenge for people who loves using their brains, however, as usual, the full price is for me too high. Let's be honest here: 10 bucks for no real innovation is too high and while I've spent my money with the launch discount (-30%), I suggest you to wait for a better price.\n\nAnd in the end, yeah, adding two colors can complicate some drawings.
