They are a mix of alot of jumping, perfectly timing events and well basically trying not to die.\n-Challenging puzzles. Each level feels unique so far.\n-Weird but amusing game mechanics. It gets some time to get used to it but the mechanics are logical and interesting to experiment with.\n-Cute characters.\n-Level editor. It has all the tools needed to put your ideas in one level.\nCons:\n-Althought there is some story implemented, the focus seems not to be on it.\n-The controls feel a bit weird at the begining.\n-I dont really understand how does one get cosmetic items and can you aim for a specific one.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502386986, "timestamp_created": 1502386986, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198049589771", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 26, "last_played": 1502386270, "playtime_forever": 350}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34333798", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Pros\n+ Very addictive - frustrating and entertaining\n+ Beautifully put-together\n+ Well-programmed\n+ Great visuals\n+ Great voice acting (discount Cave Johnson <3 )\n+ Brilliant music and SFX\n+ Keeps you on your toes\n+ Dat level editor, doe!\n\nCons\n- Controls are a little counterintuitive at times\n- Start cutscene is a bit glitchy\n- Doesn't play so well on a sub-optimal computer - needs optimising\n- The difficulty curve is pretty steep (not a con, just means the player has to learn quickly)\n\nOverall, a fantastic, entertaining game which has clearly had a lot of time and effort put into it, and one I imagine I will play a heck of a lot more in the future,\n\nMy score: 7/10", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503080118, "timestamp_created": 1503080118, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045908127", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 26, "last_played": 1503076087, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
