All the negative reviews I've seen have been either opinions or complaints about bugs (from an early access game the first week after it is released out of closed *alpha*.)\n\nOf course this game definitely has its share of bugs. Sometimes you can't place things on spots where the object is green (this is usually fixed for me by pressing E and then clicking.), sometimes animals just stand there while you're attacking them. Sometimes something in your inventory will bug and you can't remove it for a bit. \n\nBut to me, these are all minor bugs. They are not gamebreaking. Combat is not difficult. Combat requires patience, it requires you to block, to wait for your enemy to make a  move and strike when they are vunerable. You cannot just slash willy nilly at something and expect it to die (well, you can, but you will very likely die!) in the 10 hours I played the game, I was attacked by plenty wolves, yet I have not died once. The closest I came to dying was when I ate a Snowberry and it poisoned me and I couldn't figure out the recipe for medicine!\n\nThe graphics to me are absolutely stunning, I have 8GB of ram and play on the max settings and I occassionally do stutter in the large cities (which is understandable, considering I'm running at the recommended amount). I love seeing the sun shine through the trees. \n\nBuilding is very rust like and very easy to use and understand. You can make all sorts of structures! I urge people to be creative with building shapes (rather than making just squares!) Decorating the insides of the houses is very cute as well.\n\nIf you get bored of gathering, there are NPC quests you can do! If you get bored of questing, go explore the world! \n\nAll in all, this is a great game with amazing potential. The developers are friendly and will happily answer questions. They appreciate constructive feedback. It definitely is worth a try - especially if you enjoy viking culture, if you enjoy Rust, or any game similar. At the moment, there is plenty to do - and I'm so excited to be able to be here for the journey! I'm very, very excited to see what is to come.

And, the potential of this game is undeniable, whether the devs will fulfill the desires of myself or the community has yet to be seen. \n\nWhat it already does great is a straight forward crafting system that exponentially hastens as you unlock better tools and unravel the mechanics of the game.\n\nBase building has proven to be quite exciting in itself, especially when teamed up with others. While what you can build is limited at this point, being able to build wherever you like and zone off areas as your own is quite an interesting prospect.\n\nToday, my clan and I explored a few marked towns on the map. Most of these towns at this point only serve as eye candy, however, to our surprise, the last town we visited was a ruin filled with skeleton warriors. As a party of vikings  we had no other choice than to avenge our murdered ancestors. We were unable to clear the area as the skeletons were numerous and some exceptionally powerful. In the process we found some good loot and one of our party members died before we had to retreat. If this type of scenario can be recreated throughout the open world or in \"dungeons/raids\" it would be tremendous for the game.\n\nI have yet to delve into pvp, or substantial questing - thus i cannot comment on these elements. \n\nAs for bugs, I have encountered nothing game breaking. In fact, the ONLY bug I have encountered is an issue surrounding the placement of pallisade gate frames (in certain places they would be unable to build and would instead jump a few yards in a different direction where they could be placed).

The premise is that you're a viking that's survived a bandit raid and you've woken up ashore from your shipwreck on the island of Valnir.  The rest is an open book. Early on, you take a few basic quests that teach you about crafting clothes and basic weapons.  After exhausting a few quest lines I decided to find a place to build a home after seeing some really neat screenshots and builds from other players on my server.  The crafting is intuitive.

I am looking forward to the future updates for this game.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506964944, "timestamp_created": 1506964944, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2094, "steamid": "76561198061288014", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 36, "last_played": 1507161868, "playtime_forever": 2094}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35252869", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499449", "review": "[h1]I fell in love with this game and im addicted[/h1]\n\nOk can i please just start with this [b]This is an Early Access Game!!! You will encounter bugs, you will find glitches and problems, There will be server restarts, updates and hotfixes. Stuff is still in development. But you have signed up for that if you buy this or any other EA game. So please remember that when playing & reading/Writing a review.[/b] \n\nNow thats out the way i can actually start on my review :) \n\nIts a survival builder. One of my Favourite kind of games. And this one ticks my boxes. It is fun. It is engaging. It has quests. Its a pretty big map to explore i havnt explored it all yet and i look forward to doing so. Theres places to loot. Relics to find. Build your base. Can even make decorations to decortae your home, if you want to make it feel homely. And thats just the PvE side. \n\nNow PvP. Its a viking game and it can be as brutal as they were. If you choose a PvP server you can expect to be raided at any moment, Walk into passers by while hunting and farming for materials.. Not everyone is going to be friendly. Need to keep your guard up and keep your friends close by. You may need them. You dont need to play with friends either as there are plenty of clans recruiting too, that you can join up with or play solo. (But i dont recommend that) xD \n\nAs mentioned above there are official servers PvP and PvE so both play styles are covered. You can also buy your own Private server. But which will you choose? The choice is yours on that one xD \n\nFor me it runs pretty smooth, there as some laggy patches but thats to be expected. Restarting game can fix it as well as when they need to restart server. I can easily play and stream with hardly any problems :) (My PC is an i5 7th Gen overclocked, GTX 1070, 16GB Ram) Graphics are decent. Looks beautiful. Combat can be abit clunky, but still enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Now the Devs & GM's[/h1]\n\nUnlike alot of games, The devs and GMs are very hands on. They talk to you and they communicate with you. GM's Will spend time with you talking when not busy and they are there when they can be to solve your problems and answer your questions. If they cant they ask a Dev or pass it on. \n\nDevs are very fast at working on the problems that are presant. They listen to you, ask questions and then do their best to sort it out and get a patch/hot fix out. They are very responsive and some of the best Devs i have had the pleasure of speaking with.\n\nI played in the Alpha last weekend, Bought the game as soon as it released. I did then receive 2 Free codes which i gave to friends :) We now play together. <3 \n\nAll in all. Its up to you if you buy the game or not. But i recommend it 100%", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506564067, "timestamp_created": 1506563863, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2883, "steamid": "76561198306451940", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 190, "last_played": 1507163974, "playtime_forever": 2883}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35294058", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500416", "review": "This game is exactly what i have been looking for! Amazing crafting system , npcs , quests, clans, factions, building...etc . i can go on . The game is very laggy and glitchy but its pre alpha its going to be expected..it even tells you that its expected . So dont waste your money if you just dont have the patience to deal with that , other than that its a great game very well thought of and put together! I seen alot of bad reviews on the combat but i think its fine..there is a way to block and dodge which i dont think many know about :P", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506691426, "timestamp_created": 1506691426, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1497, "steamid": "76561198195006289", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 18, "last_played": 1506889809, "playtime_forever": 1497}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
