Press \"i\" for inventory and \"c\" for the crafting menu. But to open the crafting menu the inventory has to be open. In the crafting menu you will find the plant fiber there as well. More rocks can be gathered at different stone deposits around the map. You should mine more rock so you have enough stone and don't run out. I hope this helps.
