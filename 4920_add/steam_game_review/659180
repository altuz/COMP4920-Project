It's a match 3, 4, 5 game, and there are powerups available to buy with the gold accumulated.  Also, matching 4 or 5 will unlock powerups that are upgradable at the store as well.  The symbols will vary, so it doesn't get tiring.  There are clovers that need to be dropped to the bottom of the screen, but (my favorite part) is that they can be destroyed and collected by anything that would normally destroy a symbol.\n\nI finished the game and it was a fun ride.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505435557, "timestamp_created": 1505435557, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970480620", "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 2287, "last_played": 1505354038, "playtime_forever": 600}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
