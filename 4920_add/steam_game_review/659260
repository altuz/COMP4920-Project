For only 2-3 dollars you could really have some fun with this game. I'd recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys RPGs or something like that. The game isn't to hard and there is very little lag, and when there is it's probably just my computer anyway. I'd like it a little more if there is WASD controls but that's just me. So a very enjoyable game and I've only gotten up to about chapter one and can't wait to play the rest of the game. :D\n\nFor a game that has been made by only 1 person (I think) this game is great. I think it also has a lot of potential, and I personally can't wait to see what the game turns into. Some may think that this game was made lazily, but that's not true. The game has once again a great story and some people don't like the way the game looks, but how I see it that doesn't change the gameplay and the gameplay is really what I desire most in a game. I can see that Chao (the creator of Canvas Quest) put effort in this game and I respect that. Not to mention the game has been frequently updated and that's exiting too.", "votes_down": 12, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500928995, "timestamp_created": 1500245306, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198201651785", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 12, "last_played": 1500408435, "playtime_forever": 650}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
