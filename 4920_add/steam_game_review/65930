If that's not enough to get you excited, then, well...throw in some XCOM!\n\nWhich actually seems to be the source the problem. The initial reviews were overly harsh and critical, and the main source of angst I can find is whiny fanboys decrying the fact that this game isn't XCOM [i]enough[/i] for their tastes. Simply put: it's not a strategy game.\n\nI think overall that they're mostly wrong and it's a great game, but its potential was even more than it turned out to be. And I think we can also blame part of that on the XCOM name. It limited them in terms of setting and enemies and weapons and story. A fresh IP would've eliminated the fanboy backlash [i]and[/i] given them more flexibility to create something truly creative. But I get it. An unknown name is harder to market.\n\nThere's not much meta-management here, which is fine, but it's yet another point against using the XCOM name. Although I will say that getting to walk around a base and talk to people with a zoomed-in perspective after spending 200 hours or so removed from them in the other XCOM games was a fun and refreshing change.\n\nThe Bureau has the same problem Mass Effect and a lot of other games where you unlock abilities as you progress do: at some point you become totally overpowerd and the difficulty significantly ramps down as time goes on, even as tougher enemies in greater numbers are thrown at you.\n\nThe weapons were ok, but I felt myself coming back to the same few ones over and over again. I think the single biggest improvement to gameplay they could've made would've been to allow for gun customization. Let me add or remove a scope or a stock or a barrel and then change some properties based on that. My second choice would be simply adding higher levels and more abilities for my characters to acquire.\n\nThe story was good, but again, I felt it was hamstrung by having to follow all the typical XCOM tropes, which I've seen too many times at this point to be surprising.\n\nThe DLC was by far the worst part. Endless waves in a small arcade is not how I want to spend my time. Story DLC would've been a much better choice. But again, I get it. The devs are making the most of limited resources.\n\nIf you like third person shooters, sci-fi, and/or having to manage a squad and their abilities, then you should absolutely give The Bureau a try. Just don't expect a strategy game to be hiding inside it somewhere."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504853048, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494873", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34809095", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198119242396", "num_reviews": 30, "last_played": 1495962584, "num_games_owned": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 327}, "timestamp_updated": 1504853048, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I've lost interest after finishing the third mission.
