Enemies got perfect aim and 3 health, and I myself only got 1 health. Like... how the heck am I supposed to win this game. And you can not save, you must start all over on the level each time, and sometimes enemies can not be seen so you have to chance that they just wont hit you while you are jumping around and try to hit them 3 to 6 times!! before you receive 1 hit. It is crazy frustrating hard!\n\nIt almost can not recommend it, but it is cheap and maybe some like it who like these 2D type of games. But keep in mind it is superhard in some parts, some other parts they wont be able to attack you at all because they are to far away. But many situations where you have to face them later on in the game. These 10 achivements will be hard-earned.
