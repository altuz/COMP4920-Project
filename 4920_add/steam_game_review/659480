Many involve collecting items or clues hidden in random locations around the house. Items tend to blend into the environment & you might have to sweep a room several times just to catch everything. I guess you could call this \"being observant\" but it was frustrating to have 6 of 7 items you need to solve a puzzle & no idea where the last one is. I had a lot of \"ugh I have to sweep the entire house AGAIN\" moments.\n\nBut I honestly really liked the game. A lot of the puzzles were familiar but still fun. The setting was fantastic - I was totally creeped out walking around the house, even though it quickly becomes clear nothing's going to pop out at you. There's an especially awesome moment of world building that I won't spoil, but it felt worth of a Valve game. Unfortunately the ending I saw explained very little & was a let down.\n\nI'd call it a perfect game for a rainy afternoon.

I'd say about 6 hours. Maybe 4-5 on the high end for the first playthrough, then another hour or so for the \"under 2 hours\" achievement (i was going to use a spoiler tag but... its a visible achievement so i didnt think it was necessary. I have no clue how some reviewers have 15+ hours played... unless they sat in menu or are awful at...well...anything\n\nTHe puzzles are... okay. Its more of a \"look around to find the answers\" as opposed to a \"how smart are you?\" type of puzzle but thats not necessarily a bad thing. They were still enjoyable and they definitely add some things to throw you for a loop. I liked it.\n\nTheres one portion where the controls became difficult/ annoying as the floor was poorly designed and i had to jump over things i couldve just walked over. Also... and this is just a pet-peeve... I hate when they add a \"controls prompt\" (example \"press A to jump!\" at a rando point late in the game... in this instance its crouching and you need to figure out how to do it before you even get to that point... poorly done there.\n\nOverall its a fun game and I'd recomend playing it... if you can get it on sale... at full price... its just short of worth the value IMO.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505002787, "timestamp_created": 1505001103, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038743484", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 268, "last_played": 1505000623, "playtime_forever": 413}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35269727", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "I recommend this game for those who enjoyed The Witness or Myst-style games.

You will not be wading through the beauty of otherworldly landscapes as far as the eye can see. Your environment is limited, cramped; You are constrained by an unseen oppressor, and your only way to expand your borders is to use ever detail of your environment to solve the puzzles and find your way out.\n\nNow that I wrote the above, it sounds very much like the experience of an escape room, but the analogy was not overt during gameplay. The \"horror\" descriptor they chose reflects elements of suspense, anxiety, pressure, and oppressive situation, but not of blood and gore.\n\nThe puzzle elements are enough to keep you thinking, trying to tie your earlier observations with the new things you encounter; These puzzles require your attention to details, and to \"find the right thing\", but they do not challenge your intellect.
