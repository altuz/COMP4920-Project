However be aware that you are  buying an investment and not a complete game.\n\nRight now the most important mechanic (warfare) is an astoundingly one dimensional pure stat battle, aka whoever has a bigger troop score almost always wins. So thus the game is decided by how much gold you can spend to spam troops. However the gold generating mechanics of this game are also woefully under designed, the most obvious gold generator being peasents  take far too much investment to make worthwhile. Bandits seem to be far superior in generating gold, as they seem to not require building upgrades to make gold, but they generate less gold as you defeat more enemies. There are other methods of generating gold you can discover exploring the wild however most of them require such huge investments of gold and resources you can legit just start winning the game by spamming troops then killing every faction. I experimented with acquiring various buildings and almost of all them give reallly low returns for the huge investments required to acquire, I would say just spending all your gold on peasents would almost always be a better return. Execpt of course in the north where there seems to be two buildings which give a big return on the investment ( thickblood tavern and slavers)\n\nIf you are hoping that this game is going to be some complex kingdom warfare game as I did, do not expect much at the current state of the game. The diplomacy is almost nonexistant, with me only ever using diplomacy on foreign kingdoms to ask for trade routes on the first turn of the game. You can also of course pay minor bandit factions for truces and to attack other kingdoms. However these actions cost way too much for the returns. Paying 3k gold for a group of 50 bandits to stop raiding you, then pay another 3k gold for them to focus on raiding someone else.\n\nLate game is a unbearable grind of repetiviely passing your turn then selecting an enemy faction, then selecting the invade option, then select each troop category you wish to bring on this battle, which of course asks if you want to bring # of peasent or not, then the screen asks if you want to bring # of solider, then the next screen asks if you want to bring # of knights or not, then the next screen asks if you want to bring # of tier one faction A unit 1, then the next screen asks if you want to bring # of faction A unit tier 2, then the next screen asks if you want to bring..... Which you can see my point, this is one of the only games where I feel as the game gets progressively worse as you acquire various types of units accross factions. Having to type in a number to tell the game how many troops you want to bring is extremely mind numbingly boring especially when you do this ten+ times for one battle. Then after you invade you get 1 land, and due to the fact you have snowballed, every single turn is you passing then invading your neighbors. So you have to select a faction, select type of invasion, select every single troop 50+ times depending on the number of the lands in your game.\n\n\nUltimately i can see this game being a great one if the dev follows up on his promises. Right now the rpg mechanics are nonexistant, as well as the strategeic elements. The only thing to do in this game is generate gold, which is one dimensional, and only a few avenus are worthwhile. However while it may seem that this is a negative review, I don't regret the five dollars I spent on this game. I don't think i will be playing again anytime soon, but will come back in a year. I will either be pleasentingly surpised, or heavily dissapointed at the state of the game then.\n\nI would give the game a 6/10", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500069519, "timestamp_created": 1500068415, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198043518746", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 204, "last_played": 1499478640, "playtime_forever": 331}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33693349", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502311", "review": "Bought it yesterday, already played over 5 hours.

Those will be created by your own stats, so consider that carefully if you wanna kill of the bandits etc. first before finding new enemies.\nAnd one wierd thing: There is a demon army.
