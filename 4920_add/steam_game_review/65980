This is not Alpha Centauri 2, it's not a remake, and I wouldn't even call it a spiritual successor. It's a sci-fi 4x that takes place on a hostile alien planet, and that's as far as the simularities go. Beyond Earth is a game built on the foundation of Civ5, with everything that makes that game great, but with religion replaced with a much deeper and more interesting affinity system, creating a game with three distinct factions with their own gameplay and the ability to hybridize between them.\n\nIt's an amazing game that did very poorly because too many people bashed on it and complained about the fact it wasn't a different game or was somehow too similar to Civ5 (as if that would be a bad thing). Developers dropped support after a single expansion, and never truly added Windows 10 compatibility, meaning the game is highly unstable today and playing it leaves you wondering how much better it would have been with another expansion or two. Still the occasional crashes are worth dealing with for a game this enjoyable, especially with some of the great mods on the workshop."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505097300, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494799", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34875331", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198063920595", "num_reviews": 102, "last_played": 1473631016, "num_games_owned": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2962}, "timestamp_updated": 1505097300, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Eh\u2026. Honestly just play Civ 5 again. This is not a bad game, but Civ 5 is better. I appreciate the fact that they tried different things since it was set on an alien planet, but it just doesn't have the same magic that Civ 5 has. It doesn't help that the win conditions that aren't domination are essentially the same (build object 1, 2 or 3). I did appreciate that discovering items on the planet essentially led to intriguing story/quest line. But yeah, not the best Civ game. \n"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505048529, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495484", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34861441", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197992565269", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1505153311, "num_games_owned": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6946}, "timestamp_updated": 1505048529, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a great strategy game.
