This fact alone should've made me wary, since Steam isn't generous, when it comes to coupons for good games. However it looked nice enough and since I only had to pay 25 Cents, I was stupid  and didn't even bother to look at  the reviews. You're already smarter than me in this regard.\n\nFirst let's take a look at the description written by the dev:\n\n[quote=Electric Root]ABOUT THIS GAME\n\nThe age of machines ruling the world happened long ago. The remaining human resistance is spread around the world in small colonies barely hanging on to survival. With the end of an age in sight, a recon team has captured one of the droid foot soldiers and provided valuable research materials for their scientists. This discovery could change the fate of mankind, a program that enables the control of one of the machines top foot soldiers.[/quote]\n\nThis is the only lore you'll find for this game and it's not even in it. You start the game and begin shooting stuff. That's it. Also it's a rather weird design choice to make all enemies robots, but let them fight with their bare fists or sword and shield. At first I thought I was fighting undead hordes.\n\n[quote=Electric Root]It's up to you to use this opportunity to destroy the enemy facilities from the inside one by one.[/quote]\n\nThis is what you do in every level. There are 10 respawn points for enemies and you win the level once you've destroyed them all. \n\n[quote=Electric Root]Explore unknown enemy facilities, destroy their power cores, collect droid enhancing power ups, and secure the future for the human race.[/quote]\n\nIt's always the same map, so these first few words are a slap in the face. And don't get too excited for those power ups. There's only health, speed boost and shield charge.\nOh and it's a game with unlimited levels (I think), so don't count on you seeing how you save humanity.\n\nBut now to the really important part: the gameplay (since there's nothing else) and its flaws:\n\n[list]\n[*]Like the other reviewers stated, you don't shoot where your cursor points to (about 10-20 degree error) and once you're cursor leaves the map, your character spins into a default position.\n[*]There's a reason why the trailer is sped up, since you walk as fast as a knight in metal armor. \n[*]Theoretically there's a jump command, but I never managed to jump over any kind of obstacle. A yellow bar appears in the upper left part of the screen and changes position each time I try to jump, but nothing else. But then again I'm stupid, as stated in my first paragraph.\n[*]Enemies get stuck behind walls, since they beeline for you. However they can glitch across once you're near and can hit you, if you stand too close on the other side.\n[*]Some enemies have a long windup on their sword attack, but you take damage as soon as you're near them.\n[*]I don't know why, but once you stand near a power up, it blocks your bullets like a solid object. Rather obnoxious when you get swarmed.\n[*]There's supposedly a third attack, but I never got it working.\n[/list]\n\nAnd now to my biggest complaint about the whole game:\n\n[b]It's just too damn easy![/b]\n\nI played 22 levels to see, if it gets more difficult at one point, but it doesn't. There's no learning curve, no increased challenge over time. You always have the same goal, on the same map, with the same enemies and the same stats. The only thing that changes is your highscore, but in a game, where you can spawn enemies indefinitely each level, it doesn't have any meaning. I even tried if they could overwhelm me, once I give them enough time to spawn by the hundred. But nope. They just get stuck behind some walls until I come to kill them.\n\n[i]Symbiotic Overload[/i] is boring, repetitive, offers no challenge and is sloppy, when you look at it from a technical standpoint, so I can't recommend it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505422587, "timestamp_created": 1505422587, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198348999904", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 82, "last_played": 1505420344, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
