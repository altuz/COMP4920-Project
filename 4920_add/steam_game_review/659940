Hello to a match puzzle games + mini jigsaw breaks (which I look forward to eagerly).  It starts off nice and easy, teaching you and giving you facts about France - which are a nice read.  Then it gets really hard.  Good for training your match skills if you aren't as good in these games.  I also like the power ups and hate (only in a challenging way) the vine that takes over the board.  I will keep coming back to this game to sharpen my skills and maybe make it past the levels you can easily get stuck on.  Ah, the world of exciting gaming challenges.  Thank you for making this game. :)))!", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500844662, "timestamp_created": 1500844662, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198207083779", "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 125, "last_played": 1502156585, "playtime_forever": 1711}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33590835", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498206", "review": "I rarely buy casual games.
