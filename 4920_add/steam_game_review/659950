Another game!  Much harder than the first one, which either way is appreciated.  I do enjoy seeing the pictures and what is commonly found in Italy and originated there.  The Lasagna is spelled as \"lasagne\", but now that is my favorite way of pronouncing it!  And of course this game helps you take your mind off things and just enjoy the challenges.  Thank you for making this game! :)))\n\n~I just really wish the achievements worked.  I miss them as they pop up and feeling good about getting 'em!~", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503010679, "timestamp_created": 1503010679, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198207083779", "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 125, "last_played": 1503022111, "playtime_forever": 1112}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
