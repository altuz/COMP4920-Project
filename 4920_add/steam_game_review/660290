I've played more than 900 titles and this one still is crazy.\nDungeons & Geese is hard, buggy and messy, sometimes I wanted to give up even on first levels. Pleaz, creators, fix difficulty.\nBut there are still some good parts in Dungeons & Geese. It\\s pretty unique for indie-project, music is great, I liked dialogs and characters. It looks like a child worked on drawings, but I liked visualization too, it's better than pixel art. That's for sure.\nGame is good, but not for everyone.

But after 20 minutes of playing I liked that. It is obvious that non professionals made this game, it is sometimes buggy, but it definately has it's own spirit. \nAnd it is goddamn hard. Though, I started the game on hard difficulty and never tried easiest ones the picture may be not fool, but it requires, skill, timing and all lotta nerves for sure. \nMusic is awesome. If you have any opportunity, buy soundtrack. This piano is great, congrats to Vladimir Mitin, whoever he is. \nI haven't seen much of the game yet, but two first locations are pretty nice. It looks like a child drew it, but it is still warm and it creates unique atmosphere. Roof Levels are great, nice clouds.\nI haven't seen all the storyline yet, it's the weakest point of the game, as for me (because of english localisation mostly, russian is definately better), but charecters are funny and unique, as for me.\n\nTo sum up:\n\n+ Game actually works, it is a surprise for indie project\n+ Hardcore difficulty (game is challenging) may be - for some gamers\n+ Characters (Matthew Delaney, main character is sweet old gay, liked him)\n+ Soundtrack\n+ Design\n\n- Bugs. Some dialogs lead nowere\n- Menu is not excellent for sure\n- Dialogs are messed up sometimes, english version sucks ass\n\nFor a total 7/10, this game definately is not the worst indie-platformer I have ever tried, quite a surprise.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501960863, "timestamp_created": 1501960863, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198009849597", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 93, "last_played": 1501870277, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34100691", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499343", "review": "Thought this game would be much worse and less interesting than it turned out to be. From the very beginning the soundtrack and the atmposhere of it thoroughly won my heart - as if Cupid hit me with the love dildo arrow.
