There needs to be a rehaul in terms of difficulty for this to be even playable. Make an attempt at balancing waves and towers and then we can talk.\n\n70 levels of this is tragic.\n\n\nCase in point:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6ZkfSnC.png Wave 14 -> Wave 45. No towers added, no upgrades added. Surely this is a fluke? yes? Let's try the next map, oh look now there are 50 waves: http://i.imgur.com/Ems8csI.png Build towers up to wave 11. Stare at the screen for 8 minutes doing nothing (at 4x speed non the less!). Same thing map after map.\n\nI edited my erlier review because I thought maybe I was too mean, but playing the game again got the better of me. Seriously what is this? \n\n100% achievement took me 16 hours but that includes time you just let the game run in the background and then forget about it. If you apply yourself I'd estimate 10min per level (x70).  But you'll hate every second of it and start to hate yourself to boot.\n\nIf you are looking for fun, just avoid.
