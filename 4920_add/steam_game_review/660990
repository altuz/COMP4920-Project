Bigger Maps: Instead of running in circles so you don't get cornered/ run the same path over and over (gets old fast)\n2. Multiplayer: to keep it interesting\n3. More Zombie Types\n4. Objective Mode?\n\nNice graphics! Grenades are like tactical nukes  which you have to throw just under you while the horde is near, then flee before detination to get the most out of it (quite nice). Runs smooth, no FPS drops that I've noticed.\n\nWas excited to see a shotgun drop, but was disappointed with its output, must have been shooting rubber bullets :D.\nBushes snag 'you shall not pass', which are ankle/shin high.\nKinda like killing floor 2 in a much smaller scale.\n\nProbably forgot some other things but this game has potential and is fun (played 2.3 hours straight, very much enjoyed) but it's not one of those games that keeps its momentum toward the fun factor without adding some of the 4 content suggestions in my opinion.
