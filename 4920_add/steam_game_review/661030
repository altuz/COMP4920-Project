All the mechanics of the game and pickups also feel well thought out and not like this is someone's game maker game they just copied out of a \"how to code book.\"\nIt seems like it has a growing, albeit small, player-base but just hasn't received any coverage which is a shame. \n\nI'll continue to play and check in frequently after updates. It has potential. Hope someone else reads this and finds they want to drop a dollar and support a little guy. \n", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504707022, "timestamp_created": 1504707022, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001876420", "num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 552, "last_played": 1504528554, "playtime_forever": 58}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
