The presentation has a lot to be desired, and the writing could certainly use some polishing up by an English speaking proof reader.  But the story isn't why I'm here.  Despite the abundance of HOPAs on Steam, there's a dearth of pure hidden object games on the platform.  And sometimes I just want to load up a game and shut my brain down while I search for objects on my screen.\n\nAnd search for objects I did.  Actually, if you're working towards 100%-ing the game, you'll be playing each scene over and over until you've successfully collected all of the items and scored 3 stars.  While this admittedly can be a bit of a grind, I found it quite enjoyable.  Learning all of the objects' placements and quickly picking them out was satisfying in a way that's hard to describe.  Using the HINT button for those particularly difficult to find items doesn't feel like much of a penalty either, but it's actually nice to have a HOG that doesn't enforce no-hint playthroughs for achievements.  For those looking for even more challenge, there are leader boards for each HOS.  This was something I wasn't particularly interested in myself, but it adds replay for those who are so inclined.\n\nReally, there's not much more I can say.  If you're looking for a HOG without the adventure-lite elements, you might want to check this one out.  Even at full price, I feel like I've gotten my money's worth.  It may not be the perfect game, but if you just want something to whittle away your time without having to put much thought into it, you can do much worse.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505873107, "timestamp_created": 1505836723, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 189, "steamid": "76561197999732661", "num_reviews": 67, "num_games_owned": 2214, "last_played": 1506051204, "playtime_forever": 371}, "votes_up": 50, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35207982", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Good classic hidden objects quest.
