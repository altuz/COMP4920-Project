I seem to miss a lot of our hits but that could be because it takes getting used to the controls. Interesting concept as far as combat goes, I don't think I've played a game like it. I believe it will pick up speed with time, but I was a bit confused with the tutorial but I also am not the most attentive player. Check some gameplay for it and make your own decision. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnLb3QI-yM", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1498706212, "timestamp_created": 1498706212, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058864107", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 138, "last_played": 1498706144, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "32936708", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487890", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbcOTwpqAqI&feature=youtu.be\n\nI can tell there is a lot of love poured into this game.\nI can see a bunch of fairly interesting ideas stitched together.\nI can also see a bunch of issues just in the first area.\nTutorial is intrusive and not intuitive.\nCombat controls are strange, and poorly explained, especially the spell casting.\nSeveral CTD's on entering fighting space.\nLevel design makes little sense.
