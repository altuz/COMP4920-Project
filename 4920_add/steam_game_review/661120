One night changed it all. After experiencing a traumatic event at the hands of a terrible gang, Michelle's mental state begins to slip and she soon reemerges as Mercury, a vigilante determined to seek revenge upon the thugs that harmed her and exact vengeance upon any other villains that would try to hurt others in her city. As Mercury you will take to the streets nightly to track down leads, gather evidence and dish out justice to low-life scum as you attempt to complete your mission of vengeance and whether or not you become a dispatcher of justice giving hope to the downtrodden or just a ruthless killer inspiring terror on the streets is completely up to you.\n\nThe gameplay consists of strategic turn-based combat which offers you and your party a chance to make attacks before then allowing your enemies to retaliate. The victor, of course, is the group who emerges from battle before losing all of their hit points. Who to attack, what skills or buffs to use, which weapon will be more effective, all of this comes into play as you strategically try to take out your opponents. As Mercury wins fights and completes various tasks she is awarded skill points which can then be used to upgrade a variety of abilities or passive bonuses that can affect gameplay or combat in a number of different ways. Being a street vigilante, there is alot of weapons, armor and items that you can accquire or purchase in order to better outfit Mercury as she takes to the streets fighting crime. It would also be in your best interest to explore the environment, talk to everyone that you encounter or boost certain skillsets or abilities as the gameplay can be non-linear and there is often more than one way of completing a task if you are properly prepared and able to do so. Choice matters because as the story progresses you will have to make a number of decisions that could have far reaching consequences so choose wisely. To summarize, this title retains the core elements that make a great R.P.G. which is exciting combat, excellent character development and a intriguing narrative. \n\nGraphically, Mercury: Cascade Into Madness looks just as good as it's predecessor \"City Of Chains\". In  my opinion, this title easily stands out visually in the RPGMaker category mainly due to it's lack of usage of the \"anime\" or \"manga\" inspired artstyle that is so typical of the genre and it looks fantastic doing so. The characters in the cutscenes look phenomenal and the environments in-game look terrific and are well detailed...at least as detailed as an RPGMaker title can be. Also, the color palette is dark and dreary which compliments the bleak narrative quite well. Aurally, the sound is very effective both in combat and during normal gameplay but the stand out here is definitely the wonderful soundtrack.\n\nThis titles story is excellent and it was very interesting to witness this young woman's descent into madness. At various points throughout the narrative she would literally curl up into a ball as her fleeting sanity would cause her to have the strangest visions and to hear things that no person in their right state of mind would experience. Seeing spirits, talking to herself, etc...it was all really weird and inriguing yet quite disturbing at the same time but it truly added a wonderful dynamic to the story. The turn-based strategic combat is very fun as well. Also, with a variety of skills to choose from and many decisions to make in addition to two difficulty modes, Mercury: Cascade Into Madness has a high amount of replayability. Option-wise, there are a number of Steam Achievements to accquire but sadly no Steam Trading Cards to collect. However, the terrific soundtrack can be located within the game files so that is indeed a welcome addition. If you enjoyed \"City Of Chains\", another of Astronomic Games cyberpunk R.P.G.'s, then you will undoubtedly love Mercury: Cascade Into Madness. This title is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to R.P.G., turn-based combat and cyberpunk fans.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505206735, "timestamp_created": 1505022500, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004313984", "num_reviews": 52, "num_games_owned": 407, "last_played": 1503244287, "playtime_forever": 602}, "votes_up": 35, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34761522", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496145", "review": "Tags: Topdown - RPGMaker & Party RPG\n\nTLDR: Enjoyable experience with several shortcomings\n\nPros:\n+Good itemization with thematic consumables, weapons armor and skills\n+Progression involves a balance of passive and active skills\n+Decent to good music and half decent realistic approach to the RPGMaker presentation\n+Writing did not seem to suffer much typos or lack of logic, or grammar issues\n+Xbox360 pad support, fullscreened correctly, standard UI for RPGMaker\n+You get health/shop stations peppered around for convenience\n\nCons:\n+Char does not start virgin and it would had been nice to have less prepurchased abilities and more freedom in making the char more custom\n+Factions is boring Cops VS Gangsters with you as some kind of freelance agent kinda thing\n+Few interactable environments, encounter design is on the trashmob/repetitive side at least on normal\n+Soulless 3D models as portraits for everyone\n+Story, dialogue, faction politics, it is all very superficial, canned and hurts immersion\n+There seem to be some design issues when it comes to the charge point/abilities in combat, and how useful or necessary they are and how they fit into the action cycle.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504671948, "timestamp_created": 1504634236, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_reviews": 1973, "num_games_owned": 4956, "last_played": 1504633808, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
