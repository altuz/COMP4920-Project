I bought this game yesterday to make a video, since it seemed like nobody had ever did this game. I wasn't expecting much, thought it might be some jumpscares and so on. \n\n>After 40 mins playing>\n\nHere,if you wanna watch it: http://www.bilibili.com/video/av12451351/\n\nI have to say, this game surprised me really much, in the good ways. \nIn this game, while waiting for the moon to set, all you have to do is fishing, burning ghosts up using the spotlight, repairing portholes, and pushing aliens (why aliens??) back using a fire extinguisher. But you will be totally wrong if you think it's a easy thing to do. \n\n\nHere is basically what happends during the game:\n\n\n>Rolling the fishing lines\n\n>Hear the porthole breaking\n\n>Go downstairs to repair it\n\n>See a weird light coming from above\n\n>Aliens come to steal your fish\n\n>Take the extinguisher to drive them away\n\n>They took one or two fishes anyway\n\n>Turn around and find dozens of ghosts REALLY close to you\n\n>Run upstairs to get the spotlight\n\n>It's too late, a ghost bite you (Or should I say \"touch you\"?)\n\n>Hear the porthole breaking\n\n>.......\n\nA sense of rhythm is very important, and when you get used to it, you will definetally enjoy the trill it brings you. \n\n\n\nAnd to the developer, here is what more I want to see in your future updates:\n\n>>A better performance on Graphics and Audios. (Ghosts in this game seem somehow CUTE to me, at least. And the sound effects have A LOT OF space to improve. )\n\n>>Maybe some impressive Musics? In order to increase the tense. \n\n>>CO-OP Mode. It can be an Endless Mode where you defend the boat with your friends, and try to survive as long as you can! Has to be fun!\n\n>>A longer story mode and some more boat upgrades. I'm pretty sure it's already in your plan, just in case. \n\nHighly recommended.", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500712232, "timestamp_created": 1500668686, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198078320985", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 71, "last_played": 1500665778, "playtime_forever": 54}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33528475", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403200", "review": "its a pretty neat game. basically you need to run around a boat keeping ghosts at bay, fixing leaks, fishing, and stopping aliens from stealing your fish. you use the fish you catch to buy upgrades in preperation for the blood moon which i imagine is a very extreme version of the normal days. it's pretty unique and if you like those kind of games you will find the price for this pretty fair.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWXhZNrCbWw", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500007832, "timestamp_created": 1500007832, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036777325", "num_reviews": 103, "num_games_owned": 152, "last_played": 1499985315, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33779140", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479087", "review": "this game is ok it is fair for the amount of money you pay them it is kind of fun.
