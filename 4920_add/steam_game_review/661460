The 'goal' of this game I guess is to collect enough paper people so that you can have play with them in experiments, while making sure you don't forget to pick up gold bars and defuse detonating paper people so that you don't die.\n\nI have quite a few criticisms to say:\n\n1. The mouse controls makes this game difficult. You keep trying to click on the gold bars but the game thinks you're clicking on another item next to it. I feel like it's a problem that's with the Unity engine however, so not sure what more can be done.\n\n2. Instructions are fairly bare bones and there is no real sense of reward or goal. I was hoping I might be able to see the paper people I had collected frolicking about in some storage space, but instead, they just become numbers and figures on a data screen. \n\n3. There is not enough content here at all to warrant $5. There are far more games on steam which have greater value for money.
