The game is riddled with glaring spelling and grammar mistakes as well as overly simplified dialog.  I have already spotted no less than 7 of them and I am in the first area with monsters.  The UI is poorly designed as well.  Some buttons require you push only a small area of it (or outside it).  Their attempt to be more unique put them on the wrong path with their UI.  I will continue to play the game since I bought it.  If I see improvements I will update, but until then I do not recommend this game.  You can get better quality games for free.\n\nThere don't even have an option to close the program...", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500861889, "timestamp_created": 1500861726, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198042557807", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 35, "last_played": 1500861912, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33773510", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507503", "review": "Played a little on this before work, just to take a look, because I am one of those folks who enjoys RPG Maker games.  \n\n-The 'hand made' soundtrack uses tracks from the MV cover characters bundle but yes, it is all still stock RPG Maker music.\n\n-English is very clearly not the first language of anyone making this game, which is fine, but it was also very clearly not checked by anyone for spelling, grammar, etc for the translation, which is not fine.  Dialogue is very simple but still manages to look fairly incoherent at times.  Mostly this is the bad translation, but the sometimes nonsensical story pitches in as well. \n\n-The UI is pretty terrible.  Also, I noticed that when you try to use the keyboard in the in-game menu you can only open the 'missions' tab.  You cannot open your items or check your character status; you can only open 'missions'.  Mouse or tap is completely necessary to doing anything.  This is far from the only problem with the UI; in battle and out, it is a mess.\n\n-Leveling is in no way satisfying, as the enemies level with you and things seem pretty disproportionate.  For example, if you choose the 'mage' class the hornets in the area will die with one Fire spell at level 2, but require 2 casts and a basic attack at level 5.  Weirdly, after the first zone enemies appeared to drop back to level 1-2.\n\n-Related: it is easy to accidentally choose a class.  The mage will waylay you during the 'get a weapon' message and if you opt to learn anything from her, bam, that's it, you're a mage.  No confirmation or warning.  This is especially unfortunate as you will get exactly 1 MP recovery item in this early part of the game and as noted, the number of casts required doubles once you level a little.  Though MP and HP are restored on leveling, you will spend a lot of time with an empty MP bar.\n\n-Boss fights are a joke.  Killed the first archangel and took 0 damage.\n\nIt's a fairly absurd little game that I wanted to enjoy (whee, angels and demons at war) but am finding I really can't.  It feels more like an untested beta or a first project that a new developer is looking for feedback on than an actual finished product, and I certainly wish I hadn't put money down on it.    Going to agree that far better games are available free.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500928896, "timestamp_created": 1500928794, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025421300", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 161, "last_played": 1500927858, "playtime_forever": 61}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33816178", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498990", "review": "there is a lot of mistakes in this game. its sad because I got into the game, and the sotry line aint to bad; until you start seeing spanish pop out of nowhere which absolutely makes no sense.\n\nthere isnt much effort on this game from the developer.
