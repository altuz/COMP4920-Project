The trailer is like nails to a chalkboard, the description is written as incomprehensibly as the visuals. However, the game itself is actually quite fun. The controls the dev may claim is hard to grasp, however it seemed fine to me. The issue you will be having however is figuring out what any of your powers are actually doing, which actually adds to the fun of this game. I will be redoing this review later after i comprehend more of what is going on in this madness.\n\nBut for now, this is a surprisingly solid game.
