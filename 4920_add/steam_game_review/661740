Not quite.\n\nIn this review a want to adress 2 different subjects, one is the game as itself, and the other is the title \"NMS done right\" as put by many other reviewers... i have been too long chasing this fabled \"NMS done right\" and i have always come out empty handed... this is no exception, this is NOT like No Man's Sky AT ALL. (to read about this, skip to the bottom of my review)\n\nMorphite is an exploration/platformer/puzzle game. It has many common elements with the Metroid Prime series, down the female character, we have then some dungeon crawling with passive and agressive wildlife, we shoot things to get health/ammo/etc, and we scan different creatures. We can get different upgrades for our scanners/suit/weapon, upgrades that will allow us to resist new enviroments, open new paths and such, standard metroid content here.\n-Graphics are all made of big polygons and bright colors, i'm not going to complain here as it's only an artistic choice, you may like it or not, but it's not the game's fault.\nMusic feels aproppiated, no complains here either.\n-Controls are a little \"off\" specially when trying to guess where are you going to land as we have many small platforms sections that might get a little frustrating, but a little practice you will get better. The scanner range (at least the initial one) is so small that you have to be face to face with your target, making scanning hostile animals a little dangerous.\n-The story seems alright if something generic, and i didn't care much for the \"young and reckless\" protagonist... the cat it's kind of funny i guess as he seems to voice my own thought many times.\nAll in all, Morphite it's ok. Maybe a bit \"poor man's Metroid Prime\" i guess.\nAn 8/10 seems an alright rating for me.\n\nNow, as a NMS killer...\nThe opening of the game hints a lot about NMS... the ships, the space stations, the space traveling setting, even the drop pods look the same, and this about as similar as they get.\n-You can't fly your ship, just pick a solar system, and then planets/space stations from a menu, the ship will get you there and drop you off in a escape pod.\n-The planets are not planets, they are just walled and closed areas, with platforms, switches to press, creatures to kill, and loot to get, it's all pretty linear and completely different from the planets from NMS\n\nThose might be only two points, but by themselves they destroy any hope to compare both games, except to people blinded for their hate for NMS, who will end up claiming that Super Mario Galaxy was NMS done right. Morphite is not a bad game but it's nothing like No Man's Sky and i wasted more money on my quest to find my holy grail...\nJust played Morphite for an hour, but i'm not petty enough to refund it, even if i won't touch it ever again. Morphite is a good game, but if you are looking for \"NMS done right\" keep looking as this is not.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506099285, "timestamp_created": 1506099285, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "steamid": "76561197979965672", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 138, "last_played": 1506097086, "playtime_forever": 58}, "votes_up": 36, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35110071", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519034", "review": "This is a fun game.

Also, since the game is still quite new I'll try to omit any bugs from this review and rather focus on the points that I enjoy or dislike about this game.\n\nFirst, The Cons:\n- Resources seem a bit low to obtain for the potential upgrades needed, the game is already quite casual and the pace of gathering resources is already low so expect it to take a while to upgrade your ship, suit, and weapons.\n- There\u2019s no run button\u2026 You don\u2019t move that slow and you can later upgrade your movement speed with resources, but there\u2019s no run button.\n- Not enough interaction within space stations. It would be nice if I could destroy computers or plants for resources. Or have some kind of consequence like hostile station visors if you shoot them or take the resources from that room. I don\u2019t have any sense of \u2018new\u2019 or unexpected when visiting them unlike planets.\n- I noticed the same 'pattern' for a few planets, the same slopes, the same layout segments. It's not overwhelming but noticeable enough for some maps to feel 'visited'\n- Scanning things can get annoying for being a major aspect of the game. Tiny bugs are sometimes almost impossible regardless of scanner upgrades.\n\nPro's\n- Simple graphics that doesn't look ugly\n- Plenty of content, mineral harvesting, exploration, missions, storyline, side quests, space interactions, player, ship, weapons, etc upgrades.\n- There are plenty of planets to explore and each new visit leaves me enjoying the visit with a 'new' enough experience.\n- Additional weapons are unlocked with a 'Metroid' feel behind it which kicked up some nice nostalgia for me.\n- Creatures and AI interactions are nice in that anything could be hostile, fearful, or careless with the players presence.\n- There's nothing to ruin my playing experience. No hunger bars, no nagging messages, no stamina  meters, no small inventory space, no survival gauges, just a nice Casual / Exploration game that was designed with the intent of being ENJOYED.\n- Why couldn't NNS be more like this game.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game for the price, but there is plenty of rrom for improvement & bug fixes.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506573291, "timestamp_created": 1506573291, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1214, "steamid": "76561197991631174", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 92, "last_played": 1506888151, "playtime_forever": 1214}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35104982", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503979", "review": "So far this game has been fun.

Some people compare it to No Man\u2019s Sky (to the point that Youtube sticks a NMS icon on all Morphite Let\u2019s Play), and to Metroid.\n\nI can\u2019t say anything about Metroid because I have no clue what it is. Maybe because there\u2019s platforming?\n\nMorphite has a fun, cute and effective main story that\u2019s voice acted. I\u2019m about 35% through the main quest (the game tells you that). It spans 15 hand-crafted planets, allowing for interesting puzzles. You can\u2019t really rush through the main quest because your gear will be totally underpowered.\n\nYou need money to upgrade your ship, minerals to upgrade your tools and weapons, and scans (plants, minerals, fossils, tech, animals) to upgrade your suit. A bit like in Zelda games, upgrading your suit and acquiring new tools opens new areas, so take notes of where you\u2019ve found locked or unreachable things.\n\nThere\u2019s no free flight in Morphite. Click on a solar system, click Go, watch the two seconds warp animation and you\u2019re there. Click on a specific planet or station, click Go, and watch the two seconds landing animation. We live in the future, autopilot exists.\n\nThere are however minigames in the form of space encounters. Sometimes you\u2019ll man a turret to shoot at hostiles, sometimes you\u2019ll navigate through a ridiculously dense asteroid field, but that\u2019s the closest to flying you\u2019ll get. There\u2019s only one ship but you can (need to) upgrade it.\n\nThere are thousands of procedural planets, which you\u2019ll want to visit for their resources, weird life forms, landscapes, villages, shops, and (usually silly) side quests. You won\u2019t get a bajillion square miles of perlin height maps. Instead you\u2019ll visit a couple of caves, fight in a tiny but dense forest, jump over one toxic river, find your way to the top of one platformingly nasty rock, etc.. Quality and variety before quantity. I\u2019ve landed on 50 planets and I\u2019m still discovering new things (first lava river last night!).\n\nOh, and there\u2019s no inventory! Well, you do carry tools, weapons, scans, minerals, quest items, but they all show in their own list and stack infinitely. No weight, no slots, no encumbrance.\n\nI haven\u2019t finished the game so maybe I\u2019ll get bored, maybe the end will suck, maybe I\u2019ll encounter a game-breaking bug.

The voice acting is decent, for the most part, but let down by one or two scenes. The main reason I can't recommend this game is that minor issues pile up after a while. \n\nAfter finding the third key to open a gate on one of the story missions, waiting for the gate to open and using a grappling hook to get through the gate, I managed to fall through the world and die. After this the gate already had three keys in it, but my checkpoint had been at a location where the gate was still closed. So there was no way for me to progress short of replaying a whole level (planet?). \n\nAlso, I don't know how late in the game the spaceflight and ground vehicles shown in the trailer appear, but I didn't reach them. Also, while you can scan plants and animals for upgrades, this is not what you need for weapon or suit upgrades. I had a boatload of currency by the time I gave up, but not enough \"Quantium\" or \"Lumite\" to upgrade anything other than my ship. \n\nThe useless nature of ship upgrades is another thing. In my 5-ish hours I had two instaces of ship combat, which lasted maybe 20 seconds each. As a result I never felt the need to upgrade my weapons for my ship and instead save my money hoping for a random trader to sell me minerals so I could get useful upgrades for my guns which never seemed to have enough ammo. \n", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506360450, "timestamp_created": 1506360450, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 308, "steamid": "76561198041934096", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 388, "last_played": 1506359617, "playtime_forever": 308}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35160516", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500491", "review": "This game is an \"indie\" version of an alredy indie game, i love the low poly art style i love the colorful diverse worlds i think that this game has potential to be indie game of the year, the only problem i have with the game is that it does not let you have a free roam mode like ( dare i say it) no mans sky, i have not played no mans sky... yet i have it for both ps4 and xbox one but the only diffrence is that this game is also going to be on android and ios once it comes out for android then ill pick it up on my phone and ill pick it up on ios once i get another ios device, i have heard other people call this game no mans sky done right but i have yet to see if that is true because like i said i have not played NMS and i want to be able to play it first before i can give it an honest comparison. and if your looking to play it on a cheap device weather its an android or a ios device biut also on budget/ entry level macs and pcs for example this game runs pretty good on a late 2009 macbook im honestly supprised, and immpressed that this game runs at all on my 2009 macbook", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506190640, "timestamp_created": 1506190640, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "steamid": "76561198067987631", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 73, "last_played": 1507065205, "playtime_forever": 132}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35105489", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499509", "review": "not too far in, but its a fun game with some bugs that need fixing, definatly has potential though", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506003118, "timestamp_created": 1506003118, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 264, "steamid": "76561198013096139", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 331, "last_played": 1506428963, "playtime_forever": 264}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35218412", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495445", "review": "A playable version of No Man's Sky.\n\nThe core Gameplay is the same but this only costs 15$ and it has a lot more content in the game at the same time.
