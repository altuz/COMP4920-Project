The controls are simple with the ability to either turn left or right. If you press both keys at the same time you get a speed boost.\n\nYou start with a basic machine gun, which can be upgraded by collecting the aliens that drop from the spaceships you destroy. The more you collect, the more your level will increase - up to a maximum of level 3. With each level the speed of your shots increase (the game shoots for you), while at max level your weapon gets an additional boost. There is a time limit on upgrades, so you need to keep collecting aliens or you go back to level 0 power.\n\nThe weapons themselves range from the machine gun, to a laser, homing missiles and a drill. So far I have seen 9 different weapon types or varying effectiveness. For me the homing missile is best as its fire and forget, so I can concentrate on not dying. These are chosen by collecting animals that are carryed by alien ships. On the side of either a Cow or Sheep there is a letter (or number) that represents what gun you will switch too when you save them.\n\nYou get 3 lives to begin with, which can be replenished by saving an cow or sheep. Lives are lost if you are hit by an enemy shot, or if you accidentally run into an alien ship.\n\nThe art style is attractive (IMO), and is reminiscent of Game & Watch handhelds. The enemy's remind me of the sprites you would find on these systems. There is also an option (left mouse click or A on the xbox controller) to have the screen clear or more of an \"aged\" look. This helps bring a little more authenticity to the look of the game. The rest of the screen also matches Game & Watch handhelds with the button and screen layout.\n\nI am happy recommend I.F.O, the gameplay is simple but I feel it does it well. Turns can be quick and even a good run may only last a few minutes. The only negative I feel is the price might be a bit steep for some if they dont have Game & Watch nostalgia - a 2.99 price point would have been more accurate and help garner more sales. If price is an issue, perhaps add it to a wishlist and wait for a sale.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502460487, "timestamp_created": 1502460487, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960286303", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "last_played": 1502456473, "playtime_forever": 99}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
