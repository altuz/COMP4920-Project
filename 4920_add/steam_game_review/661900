It has some drawbacks, like how upgrading anything but weapons at the beginning leads to instant death, and the default settings being weird, but it also has some fun gameplay, oodles of replayability, and bunch of weapons and enemies. Furthermore, this game looks great and I have yet to encounter any bugs in it. \n\nIn short: Worth the two dollars you should get it.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500799682, "timestamp_created": 1500799682, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198077771679", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 65, "last_played": 1506719780, "playtime_forever": 389}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
