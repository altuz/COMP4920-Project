There is a new addition ability Sara can use now to help her through the journey to find a 'cure'. The story wasn't bad or boring like the previous ones but the puzzles are still the same, and I wonder when AM will stop recycling those puzzles, I'm glad there wasn't any sliding puzzle which they spammed us with it in the previous game. But still, most of those mini games are always the same in each and every Artifex mundi games.\n\nThe voice acting was ok, but Sarah didn't say a single word during the adventure other than screaming and gasping which was quite annoying.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1138121415\n\nI got confused with one of the mini games but I eventually was able to find a solution. I also liked that the little helper doesn't stick around till the end of the game and in this one we got a help from two different helpers.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1138088001\n\nPros:\n+Very beautiful and amazing graphics as usual.\n+Fast traveling map.\n+Easy hidden objects scenes.\n+Good music.\n+OK voice acting (Except for the main character).\n+Collectibles \n+Easy achievements.\n+Steam achievements.\n\nCons:\n-Same puzzles as previous games.\n-Useless journal, showing only the objectives, I like the journal to have entries about the characters and a brief summary of the events.\n-Very short game (Took me four hours to finish the main game and the bonus chapter)\n\nI didn't like the ending of the main chapter, it felt incomplete, and the bonus chapter wasn't very satisfying but the ending was OK. I'm not sure if there will be plans for a new secret order but I suggest they should stop it here.\n\nI'm so glad there wasn't a 'complete the game in Expert difficultly' achievement this time. The other achievements are nice and casual.\n\nI recommend this game if you've been following Sara's adventure and want to enjoy the graphics, music and the new story. Its not the best, but it is not bad either. I enjoyed it but I can't see myself playing it again.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506164420, "timestamp_created": 1506164420, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071375554", "num_reviews": 64, "num_games_owned": 1062, "last_played": 1505740640, "playtime_forever": 285}, "votes_up": 20, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34833172", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524802", "review": "[h1]Short version: 73%[/h1]\nThe Secret Order 6 is a well-made and fun hidden object game with great visuals and enjoyable gameplay elements, but one that is also almost completely unremarkable. \n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nThe Secret Order 6: Bloodlines is the kind of hidden object game that cannot really stand out of the crowd, yet it has no real weaknesses. The graphics are nice. The hidden object scenes are nice\u2014especially those that try to add some light puzzle elements. The conventional puzzles, including the amount and intensity of the point \u2018n\u2019 click elements are nice. The pacing is nice. Everything is nice, but nothing ever elevates beyond being nice. Granted, it is more than enough to make Secret Order 6 a fun enough HOG.\n\nSince the series removed the original time-travel concept in the last instalment, the plot here is more of a conventional adventure, where our heroine, Sarah, follows her mother on an expedition, only to foil yet another plan of the Dragon Clan (who at this point could rename themselves Generic Villain Corp.). On the plus side, the story is a lot more grounded in reality, with no fairies, princesses, or any sort of thing, just a simple adventure to the jungle and back.
