This p.huking game is P.HUKING AWESOME AS P.HUK!  :-)\n\nIt is very cleverly written and made me burst into laugher two or three times in just my first hour of play as well as a few chuckles too.  The last time I played an old school RPG game of this style was way back in like 1996 or so when I bought \"Chrono Trigger\" for the Super Nintendo!  \n\nWatch this P.huking game P.HUK me up!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq9W3jt6kvQ\n\nAll I gotta say is two things...\n\n1) You're already reading the reviews for this game, so you are thinking about it.. STOP.  ..Just BUY it!  ..It's a really good indie RPG maker game for sure.  \n\n2) When you buy it and play it your first time, Remember to SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN.  LOL.. I just lost a battle an hour into it and forgot to save my game before my fight like a doofus.  I'm so used to current gen games auto-saving that I completely forgot about how important saving these kinda games is!    Oh well, no biggie because this game is really enjoyable and starting over will just mean more enjoyment!\n\nI'll be back to review this game once I finish it, but so far, loving it.. looks like it's gonna score a minimum of an 8 out of 10. That's not bad at all for a game at this price, especially an RPG.  :-)", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506244482, "timestamp_created": 1506211574, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "last_played": 1506510034, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35196077", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504384", "review": "First let me say I'm a bit bias.  Any game that takes on the Metal genre is already a great game.  But now can that great game become something I really love.  I could name a few examples where I expected this to happen but didn't.  I could also name a few that barely where even a bit better than my expectations simply cause it's claims to be a metal type game.  So in this case I'll grade this game in two ways.  One, how it compares to other games in general and two, how it compares in the Metal genre of games.\n\nI did not go into this game with very high expectations.  As stated previously it can't be all that bad after all it's got Metal as a backdrop.  So comparing it against other games in general I'd say it met or overcame my expectations.  The only negative in general thing I have to say about the game overal is the lack of graphical settings but I soon found myself forgetting about that and enjoying the story/gameplay/music/fights/explorations just to name a few things that helped me forget.  I'll mention the others below when comparing it against Metal games.  Seriously, great, funny story telling even if you don't get the Metal references that are a plenty.  The turn based combat is simple to pick up and easy to plan your attacks.  The art work isn't perfect but it sure as hell isn't any where close to the worse I've seen.  Overal I'd leave you with this.  I have a major gaming ADD problem and using a first time out in a game I'm lucky to play an hour.  Next thing I new I was at 2 1/2 hours in this game and it was past my bedtime.\n\nNow to compare it against other Metal games this is one of my top 2 or 3 games.  Hands down the most fun, less stressful, great metal riffs (although I wish it had a bit more to begin with), and helped me totally escape reality.  OH and I laughed so hard at this game.  Any metal head will love the metal references.  They are in your face.\n\nThanks Crankage Games for a fun game.  I think sometimes developers forget the fun part in gaming but you sure didn't.  I look forward to your next project and hope you keep puting out the fun.\n\n\\m/ Peace \\m/", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506312958, "timestamp_created": 1506312958, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "steamid": "76561198064261649", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 440, "last_played": 1506210468, "playtime_forever": 154}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34826755", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Well done to the creators of this game!
