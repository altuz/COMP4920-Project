Then Im walking to the rager station and as im going up the stairs I get stuck and im unable to get free. Had to restart the game and that fixed that. But I did get stuck on other object in this game. This game is full of glitches. This is more like Project glitch. I don't recommend this game as it is now unless the the gliches are fixed. \n\nSee game play and me getting stuck on the stairs: https://youtu.be/DY6Q-vq9yKQ", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506289085, "timestamp_created": 1506289085, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "steamid": "76561198024791846", "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 220, "last_played": 1506273172, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
