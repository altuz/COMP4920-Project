While it doesn't have a major studio behind it, it's clear that the team has emphasized quality of simulation as well as functional yet endearing graphics that help bring your colony alive. \n\nFrom humble beginnings (aka two beetles), you grow your colony over time, tackle challenges from a variety of different ideas, and attempt to control a neighborhood. \n\nThe game mixes a few elements (part SimBeetle, part Command and Conquer (Lite), part Petrie Sim), but the big draw is evolving your bugs over time to your specifications. \n\nThis is the kind of game you can pick up and play for awhile, in small doses or longer sessions.\n\nHighy recommended!", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506128206, "timestamp_created": 1506128206, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976792482", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 412, "last_played": 1505934640, "playtime_forever": 76}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
