I particularly liked the \"pocket sand\" ability, that lets you blind enemies within a certain cone.\n\nOn normal difficulty the game is not particularly difficult, I ended up completing the campaign losing only 2 gang members, while using the same 4 gang members to complete most missions. That said I did make thorough use of the \"tactics mode\" which lets you pause time and plan out your actions carefully.\n\nCompleting the enjoyable campaign on normal difficulty took me a good 6 hours, I feel it's worth the price.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504985365, "timestamp_created": 1504985365, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025306252", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 59, "last_played": 1504984443, "playtime_forever": 381}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34863822", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1505085939, "review": "I enjoyed this game however and it might just be for me but the last lvl freezes everytime, anyone having the same issue?\neither all i hope to see more updates this games fun as hell", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505055248, "timestamp_created": 1505055248, "developer_response": "The issue is fixed in version 1.1.1 when you update.

At first I died, and then... I died a little more. However, like a lot of good tactics games, I kept getting that urge to come back and try again. Now it's one of my favorites when I need a quick break.\n\nSome tips I found, use the tactics mode to pause and make a plan. This is great for holstering, drawing, and coordinating a simultaneous raid when you have a bigger posse. Speaking of which, start recruiting from the Lineup on the main menu as soon as you get some cash. Once you have a few people in your posse it gets a lot more fun to plan out a strategy.\n\nIt still often takes me a few lives to really map out a mission, but the later missions have a lot more going on and are fun to try and get perfect. In the end, I am glad I picked it up. It has a cool charm to it, some really great moments, and like I said it is great for when you want something fun and quick.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505715477, "timestamp_created": 1505715477, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970979543", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 305, "last_played": 1505803869, "playtime_forever": 1391}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34793839", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491790", "review": "Very fun game.
