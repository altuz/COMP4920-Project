This game has a lot of potential and im excited for it, but as of right now I wouldnt reccomend it till some bugs are fixed.

As well as some of the buildings didnt have details so that i could tell the purpose so the city (mainly service buildings) and sometimes my building would fling off the map and just be gone (Bye bye family of six T.T).

Felt like an early access release.\n\nHere's the issues I had:\n\n\u2022 Nothing seemed to simulate. I followed the tutorial (which I kept unintentionally reseting by touching a strange plot of land next to my starting position), but nothing happened; no people spawned, no change in stats. It was broken for me.\n\n\u2022 UI and tutorial are poorly thought out. I didn't find it intuitive at all, text was hard to read, pacing of tutorial didn't seem tied to the actions I was taking, and response time on menus and touchpad controls are finicky. I tried to just accept it and see what I could figure out, but it's a recipe for frustration.\n\nI'd love a VR city builder (even a simple one), but I'm strongly considering returning this unless the issues I had are resolved.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500147225, "timestamp_created": 1500147225, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970561757", "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 279, "last_played": 1500142857, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33704807", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "Game has a lot of potential in the next update or two, but for now I can't recommend it since the bugs/issues are game breaking. To list some of my bugs/complaints so maybe they can be looked into:\n\n- No real menu to change any sort of settings, audio, restart, save, etc. Would be very helpful.\n\n- Tutorial moves too fast and isn't detailed enough. I don't like sitting through a 30 minute tutorial but it needs to have enough to that all the controls and all the aspects of the game and how it works are touched upon. I felt like I was told half of what I needed to know and had to figure out the other half.\n\n- Can't figure out (if it even exists) how to delete roads? Accidently clicking somewhere can place a bunch and it ruins things.\n\n- As for bugs I've had a few. For one, snapping to the street is sometimes a little buggy.\n\n- Switching between builder view and the first-person city view sometimes just doesn't work.\n\n- If you're holding a building to place down in city view then switch to builder view while holding it, the building becomes gigantic.\n\n- Buildings can rather easily fall through the map before being snapped to the street.\n\n- First game I tried, after placing some roads and buildings, cars/people started to generate. After restarting, no matter what I did, no cars or people ever showed up.\n\n- Tutorial sometimes bugged out and wouldn't start properly.\n\n- Able to place roads directly under placed buildings, which isn't good.\n\nNone of these are \"major\" game breaking bugs on their own, but all put together I really can't enjoy, let alone even play the game in this condition. Again, this game has a ton of potential and I hope the devs are working hard to fix and address some/all of the issues people are having. For now, I'd recommend not picking this game up, however if most of the bugs are addressed, it can definetly be a great VR game.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500668485, "timestamp_created": 1500668058, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066054641", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 99, "last_played": 1500602942, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33690599", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "I really wanted this game to work.\n\nTutorial never completed, and I ran into every single bug the other reviews mention (no ground level, simulation not running, tutorial not advancing, buildings flying off the map on spawn, buildings fly off on grab, crash on load, crash on pause).\n\nIt feels like a pre-early access title and I'll be refunding it unless these issues are fixed in the next few days.
