It's a visual novel, there is one button and that's to click next for the next bit of text and there are a couple of spots where there are 2 choices, although I don't know if those choices make any difference.\n\nI expect this game plays a lot better if you can read Russian but I found it hard reading through the poor (but not terrible) translation to English. There were several bits of text that were obviously Russian maxims that didn't make sense when tranlated to English. The poor transaltion was enough to break the 4th wall and too much energy is spent working out what the characters are saying.\n\nThe text outputted too slow, it should have been instant or a lot faster by default, having text appear slower than can be read is unpleaseant. There is an option to speed up the text.\n\nI think the game should autosave before the options.\n\nOptions are a mess - it's hard to know what's going on here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1131173969\n\nSo, I got my hands on a 90% off coupon, at \u00a32.79 it is overpriced, for \u00a30.28 it's ok.\n\nI'd buy the 2nd chapter only if it had the same discount or for a bit more if the gameplay was longer.\n\nIf bad translations bother you then avoid this game, otherwise the story is interesting but doesn't go far, this feels like one  tenth of a game.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504948435, "timestamp_created": 1504948435, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198034530531", "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 1639, "last_played": 1504947090, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
