Almost immediately after logging in, I was relentlessly killed by other players.  The big glaring issue with this, is that new players start with a fully loaded AK47, but you lose it after you die.  So, players who have been there a while are farming ammo and guns off people who just spawn in, then those players are left high and dry.\n\nThere is no teaming up in this game, unless you load in with a friend. Also, the player base appears to be entirely made up of Russian speakers (not an issue, just beware if you're looking to voice chat in English).\n\nThe graphics feel old and muddy, while the sound seems pretty decent.  For the little amount of shooting I did get to do, the hit detection seemed to work okay.  Although I did unload 5 shots from a shotgun point blank into some kind of swamp monster who seemed unaffected.\n\nFor the actual meat of the game, you spend most of your time wandering around and looking for supplies to patch together weapons and survive off food you find in random locations.  The game world feels large, and fairly sparse between locations.  There are random areas that have this electric looking blue glow which will kill you if you go near.  I'm not sure if that is supposed to be a visual representation of radiation, as that is also something you are supposed to avoid.\n\nAll in all, this game is playable and the online servers were actually very responsible.  I did get bored quickly though and feel there are better options out there.  I'm going to say the game has some potential, but I can't recommend at this time.\n", "votes_down": 10, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501828759, "timestamp_created": 1501828759, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984712587", "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 168, "last_played": 1501838268, "playtime_forever": 195}, "votes_up": 32, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34003291", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524595", "review": "This game is like a knockoff multiplayer stalker wannabe that also has pay to win aspects such as buying weapons and ammo for real money.
