There's a few reasons for this.  \n\n1) Price - .99 cents is the right price for the content (very short ride)\n2) Improvements - game runs much smoother now, still stuttered a bit on high, but on low and medium settings ran very well, dragon's fire breathing looks pretty cool now\n3) Responsive dev - fixed the description, updated game, etc., \n\nThis is one of the best looking VR roller coaster games out there, but it's just extremely short.  Still a must buy for roller coaster fans.\n\n----\nThe reason I do NOT recommend this game is because this developer is lying on the store page.  \"Crazy tracks\", plural.  This implies there is more than one track to experience.  There is not.  There is only one track.  One track which you can exprience in High, Medium, or Low Settings.  It's still one track.  And I couldn't tell the difference between high, medium, or low settings (past the home page where you can see the effects on the shadows) other than the frame rates really stuttered on high (I have Oculus Rift with GTX 1060 and i7, 16 gb ram)\n\nThe track is nice, but it's way too short.  There's free demos that last longer.  IF the dev was just honest, I could recommend this game because it delivers a nice setting for a roller coaster VR ride even if it's too short.\n\n3/10 DO NOT BUY\n\n[spoiler] They even messed up the dragon, doesn't breathe fire at you, WTF [/spoiler]", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503216228, "timestamp_created": 1502405662, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1503215764, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34156299", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497023", "review": "Single best VR coaster available.\n\nMake sure your seated posititon is in the exact center of your playspace, otherwise the virtual chair will be off and there is no way to pause it.\n\nPlease consider bundling your upcoming ride with this current one.
