As of this writing, it is $1.50, and it will take you quite a bit longer to beat/read this than it does a normal $2.99+ comic book you may pull from your comic shop of choice.  So, honestly, even though it is quite short for a video game, it's not necessarily a bad value, given the medium it is trying to emulate.  So, with that out of the way, I actually want to talk about the game.\n\nI loved it.  I thought it was witty and fun.  Nothing dour or somber to be found.  Every character has a really distinct personality, and each one is enjoyable to see and interact with.  The plot is very simple, but it moves along nicely, and I enjoyed the story overall.  There's no major themes here that will leave you scratching your head.  It's a simple story of a guy trying to save his all you can eat buffet from closing down.  It's very charming.\n\nThe art is simple, clean, and easy on the eyes.  It looks exactly like a Sunday comic, and I love that.  As with dialog, each character has a unique design that is very expressive.  There isn't a lot to say about the game's style, but I enjoyed it.\n\nAs for playing the game, it's straightforward point-and-click.  Talking to characters, choosing all the possible conversation options, checking out your environment, using all the possible item combinations, and, ultimately, figuring out the correct combination of the above to move the story forward.  If you don't enjoy point and clicks, this won't change your mind; however, with the shorter format, you can easily check all those things within 30 minutes.  So even if this isn't a genre you traditionally enjoy, you can at least rest assured that the tedious part of those games isn't very prevelant here.  Brevity may just be this genre's friend.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I loved the game.  Is the best?  No, of course not.  But it's a charming, silly story, that you can experience over you lunch break, and I appreciate that.  It's got a fun cast of characters, witty dialog, and it's just engaging throughout it's short time on your screen.\n\nP.S.  Printing out your comic after your first playthrough is also a neat feature.  I don't think it is something to be swayed by, and as such, I didn't mention it in my review, but I do think it's pretty cool to have.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500065820, "timestamp_created": 1500065820, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198027019263", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 367, "last_played": 1500065182, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33533331", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504071", "review": "I saw this game and bought it for the unique art style and premise.\n \nThe story, characters, and dialogue were all as funny as the premise, and I found the comic book style to be a really great way of storytelling, big kudos to the developers for coming up with this!

But if you like old fashioned newspaper style comics and old fashioned point-and-click games it's worth your time. After you finish the game you'll be asked if you want to print your comic and if you do, the game will generate a pdf file containing all the panels of your play through. \nIt took me about half an hour for the first play through where I read every dialogue option and looked at every item description and then I spend another half hour or so in order to get all of the achievements. It was a short, but fun experience. My first play through resulted in a 320+ page pdf file because of all the dialogue options and item descriptions. But at heart it's a short game that can be finished within three minutes. \nOnce you've finished the game you can play a new game+ which features developer commentary. This is also worth listening to; I always find it fascinating to get an insight into the development process and you do indeed get an interesting look behind the scenes. The developers mention that they decided on a number of simple rules in order for the game to work well (like a simple interface and mostly three panel responses) and in my opinion they've succeeded. \nDespite it's short length I was impressed by the game. The art style isn't stellar, but it's well done and fits the story and narrative style. I actually like the fact that you can sometimes see the left over lines from the penciled sketches and there's a coffee stain on one of the panels. The plot is kinda thin and the puzzles are simple but the developers state in their commentary that this is mostly a proof of concept. If enough people buy and like their game, they might create more and longer games with the same concept. \nAs far as I'm aware this is indeed the first interactive comic ever created. There have been some games with a comic book like aesthatic, inspired by comics or with comic book style cut scenes (Comic Jumper, Comix zone, Noctropolis and Max Payne come to mind) but none of those games were interactive comic books quite like this game is. \nAnd as one of the other reviewers mentions it makes for a great (cheap) gift if you have friends that enjoy comics and/or point-and-click adventure games.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501086720, "timestamp_created": 1501086720, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017392185", "num_reviews": 117, "num_games_owned": 3097, "last_played": 1501081883, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33532842", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Very funny game.
