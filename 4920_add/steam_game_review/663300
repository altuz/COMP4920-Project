It has really smooth gameplay and the loop is really well done.\nYou go into the dungeon, make it as far as possible, find stuff and die. Then you get put back to the starting town where\nyou can get stuff from traders including guns and a pretty cool card system that gives you buffs and makes each run\ndifferent. So far i've only made it to level two. That is because the game is hard and you'll get killed over and over again. \nI want to go back and try different weapons and cards though and that is why the game works so well for me. \n", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505063586, "timestamp_created": 1505063586, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 152, "steamid": "76561198117442318", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 122, "last_played": 1506938365, "playtime_forever": 1160}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
