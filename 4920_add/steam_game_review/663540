Then this little logic grid puzzle game is for you. It offers exactly what it promises and has an infinite replay value since every case is randomly generated. The option to mod everything from the graphics to the clues is a neat feature - freshening up the visuals a bit actually does wonders after playing for some hours.\n\nThe only thing I miss is a greater variety of clues and difficulty levels, as the majority up until the very last one tends to be a bit on the easy side. Not that it's a big issue. The game still offers good fun for a good price.

Basically infinitely more. They are randomly generated, so it is not likely you get the same one on higher leveles. On the other hand the randomness might varies the cases difficulty (at least for me).\n\nUnfortunatelly the UI is not even near to what i would like to use. Even if the elmination part (someone couldn't be chef since the chef is British and he is French and so) is hard to implement now, a starting neutral stage for all traits would be nice. And especially that if the cluebook wouldn't cover out everything. I thought the higher level speedrun achievements would be almost impossible even with these changes, but since some people already got them... well, hats of to them if they have done it fairly.\n\nSo yeah, this games frustrates me a great deal, but i'm still coming back for more (which is a rare thing with my low tolarence for BS).
