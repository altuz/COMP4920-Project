So go find that on kongregate if you want to figure out if you want to spend money on this or not. At first the game feeIs slow and sluggish, and I got a bit disappointed with the length of the game since it ends very quickly. But I figured I'd try for the harder difficulty as well and and I found that much more interesting. Honestly it's quite the grind on the harder difficulty - but it's pretty interesting finding out that more than one strategy is viable. \n\nYou get less and less experience from monsters you have beaten earlier (monster have levels I guess, but nothing that is displayed to the player), so soon you'll run out of places to grind experience, which makes it possible to gimp yourself. So the progression feels a little bit diablo-esque: Try a build, mess it up, try something better. There is not an endless amount of strategies though, but I think it holds up pretty good for a few play throughs.\n\nSome less pretty things:\nThere are some entirely untranslated pages, and others that are almost incomprehensible because of the bad translation job.\n\nThen there are some issues that seems to be smartphone related. Like do we really need to open up a modal window to spawn units? On a pc-screen surely you can fit in a bar with 10 buttons to spawn your warriors? Mystery-meat menus and camera panning are other things that feels suspiciously like it was made for smartphone (or perhaps made with some smartphone framework). But it's not too bad, there are keyboard shortcuts for most things (except the unit spawning).\n\nI think you need something like 10-12 hours to complete 100% achievements in this game. (Which ends up being about two play throughs, normal and hard.)\n\nAll in all, it's a solid game.
