If you go into this recognizing that the bones are there, and intend to help debug the game and give good feedback then this is the game for you. If not, then accept that the playability at its current level is probably about 20 hours of content if you are goal and progression oriented. It is still fun, but logging frequently is currently par for the course to clear out graphic bugs.\n\nPro's:\n\nHuge area allowed for town creation makes it easy to customize your layout so your town is not cookie cutter to someone elses out there.\n\nPersonal housing with (limited) decor is available. The furniture options can be placed to YOUR liking.. bonus! While this is not as robust a decorating system as a game like Everquest2 has, it is nice to see freedom of placement and rotation are present.\n\nQuests give a sense of purpose lacking in many sandbox style games like the one which involves digging and crafting =p\n\nThe artwork has a fresh almost WOW meets Free Realms look to it which goes well with a dwarvish character model and which could be enticing to younger players.\n\nCombat system: currently in the infancy of the game, yet it seems to be going in the right direction. Kiting is currently doable, and monsters have a predictability to their fighting pattern which allows a player to anticipate when to back out of range, and when to get in the monster's face. \n\nDev activity is HUGE and very definately pro-active. You cannot help liking this guy! He is super personable and gets things done quickly and seems to sincerely appreciate feedback and bug reports. NICE!\n\nCon's\n\nResource gathering is randomized and based entirely on the quests you recieve which makes it hard to get healing potions.\n\nThere is no information regarding monster health levels ( ie why are some of the monsters health bars pink, or red, or yellow?)\n\nQuests are random.. you could get 5 at once and then wait an hour or more in real time before you get any at all. (The Dev explained this was a bug)\n\nThere are no mobs or resources (other than wood) which can be gained outside of quests currently. \n\nNo Personal storage is currently available so inventory management is a priority and can lead to the destruction of things you may need later. (The Dev has stated they will be implemented soon TM)\n\nMulti-play is not available (this would be really nice for families, especially if it could be done LAN network or on private servers.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505687186, "timestamp_created": 1505614593, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "steamid": "76561198382501005", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 6, "last_played": 1506892917, "playtime_forever": 1272}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34988349", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499650", "review": "Still very early access. Nothing inherenly wrong with the game, but it's pretty clunky, slow to play and seems to be a lot of \"run & fetch\" type quests.

To address this problem i would recommend increasing the enemy's rit range or maybe change the very long charge up time that makes them stand still and then swing at you 1 second later. Or hey, maybe add a charge up animation to the enemy to incentivise use of the block mechanic of the game.\n\nThe building in this game is quite a good start with them having a lot of buildings to chose from but i would like an option to rotate the building freely, as of right now you're only able to rotate the building 4 times that being either having the front of the house facing the north, east, west or south. one other thing i find annoying about the building system is that the roads are placed automatically in front of the building, and there is no option to build your own seperate roads, so if i want to build a quarry house further away from the storehouse then i would have to build a bunge of buildings in between just to connect the quarry and storehouse roads.\n\nThe dungeons are mostly only reskinned  rehashess of the same enemies and restructure of the layout of the older dungeons. There was one dungeon were there were traps and flames being shoot through the walls, that was a nice edition to the old boring rehashed dungeons from before.\n\nThe villegers or NPCs are all the exact same person, when you speak with one if he's not recived a jobb he will say \"i am a worker\" sometimes you will get a random quest to ask the workers about their illness, every time you get this quest it's the exact same respone, and nothing to seperate the wokers from each other. I would say work on the individuality of the NPCs.\n\nThat is all i have to say about the game in it's current state, i don't grade games on a how good they might become later on in the development, i only see a game that charges people money and i believe that gives me the right to review the game just like any other title that charges you money early access or not.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505725909, "timestamp_created": 1505725909, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010216103", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 112, "last_played": 1505725511, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
