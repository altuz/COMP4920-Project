Maybe it will change something.\nFirst of all, this is PC port of F2P mobile game. Before purchase, I tried android version of the game and i enjoyed it. However, PC version disappointed me because of the following reasons:\n\n1. Screen resolution, these nice black bars on the sides. \n2. Controls. Developers didn't change it somehow, I still need to imitate swipe with my mouse (and this is main reason of my discontent, because it's really annoyingly awkward), [b]but it would be much better if I could hold any vertex of hexagon and turn it.[/b] \n3. How should i quit the game if there's no exit button?![spoiler]ALT+F4[/spoiler]\n\nAll these reasons show me that developers don't care about proper PC port, they just dropped this on steam to earn some easy money, forgetting about respect for the players. So I'm gonna request a refund.\n[i]P.S. It would be nice to add the opportunity to cancel the rotation until I release the button with a return to the original position.[/i]", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499008825, "timestamp_created": 1499006570, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057552874", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 72, "last_played": 1499006873, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
