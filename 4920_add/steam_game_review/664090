The demons are lifelike, make you feel small and your weapons just seem adequate, how a game should be.\n\nWeapons are a choice of sword and shield or revolver and shotgun, or bow and arrow. Trophies go to your cabinet depending on how you go in the game. Be prepared for demons rushing you from every side and above and can get quite nerve-racking. \n\nJust of late it seems VR games are getting better, I have so much to play now it's overwhelming.

The weapons feel good (except the bow and arrow) and generally reward accuracy. For the price, Eternity Warriors is an artistic and gameplay masterpiece that I highly recommend anyone with a VR enabled device give a go at; the enemies design forces you to actually stratergize whether to kill them or not; and compared to many other VR first person shooters, the game actually has many mechanically unique enemies with different looks and attack sets. \n\n10/10 would recommend sexy demon lady\n\n20/10 would recommend for gameplay", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506316723, "timestamp_created": 1506313761, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 643, "steamid": "76561198069175441", "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 374, "last_played": 1506808514, "playtime_forever": 643}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35235379", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "This game kicks some serious ass.

The first time I had the enemies sprint at me it freaked me out as the graphics give the game great depth perception and I could really get a sense of scale to the surrondings and enemies.\nConsidering how good the game looks, it runs great, although no graphics options that I could find, it doesnt need them as I am running on an I5 4690 and gtx 970 and have had no issues so far which is a huge plus.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun and intense, you can choose between 3 classes (1: Sword, Shield and palm laser/beam. 2: Bow and Arrow. 3: Shotgun and Revolver), which all have there own unique abilities and are varied to keep them all interesting.\nAll the enemies have unique ways of attacking or defending against them such as hounds that ambush you from stealth meaning you have to listen out for them and deflect the projectile they fire back or attack its position. \nEach class has there own set of levels that you have to play and you can go for the high scores, fastest time, or both which just adds onto the intensity from the gameplay.\nI cannot comment on the Co Op mode as I havent been able to play because of the lack of players currently which is upsetting.\n\nThere are some issues that I did have, such as for the shield I find it difficult to keep track of the durability during a game, some of the enemies get stuck around the levels and some (mainly the archers) spawn with something infront of them and cannot shoot, plus I had some enemies that seemed to spawn in new places only once or twice which is very frustrating. As I mostly play solo, in the single player mode there is rather little amount of levels and I think that it is still worth it but it is still a rather limited amount of levels but of course its in early access and has only been released recently so I expect there to be new levels added in the future and it will definitly be worth at the the current price (\u00a310.99) but even then I still recommend it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506708363, "timestamp_created": 1506708075, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "steamid": "76561198090192946", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 83, "last_played": 1506703441, "playtime_forever": 154}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35289276", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "As a game dev (non-VR) I'd say these guys are doing a great job for this game! I played like 2 hours and would like to share what I think of Eternity Warriors. \n\nVisual - 8/10  the details of the monsters, environments and weapons are top tier. I love the lighting effects too. However, if there were more brighter environments I could give it an even higher score.\n\nControl - 8/10  I'm using a Vive and I don't find any problems with that. I meaning leaving one point here because it seems Oculus users would see some issues turning around 360 degree.\n\nThe other losing point is for the abscene of locomotion. I wouldn't say it's a big problem for this game but I can't blame a game that could offer me more choices.\n\nGame/Level design - 9/10   I can tell that the design team invested their major energy to make EW VR a very special one. Monster AI, terrain, weapons and skills are very unique (in a good way) when they come together in this game. The 2nd mission of the swordman really impressed me - hardcore, intense, but very rewarding.  I wish to see more diversified content. The team should be investing more into that. \n\nMultiplayer - ?/10  I haven't played it yet. It seems I need to wait in the lobby for quite a while before finding another real person so I'm leaving a question mark here.
