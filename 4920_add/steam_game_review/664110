Could definitely see this game being played at a hardcore level, and I certainly hope it does. The level of given customization is great and the controls and gameplay are tight and fluid, allowing it to be picked up quickly. Would definitely recommend if you're not sure what to do with those last 4 dollars.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499731276, "timestamp_created": 1499731276, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067787636", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 165, "last_played": 1501229048, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
