The 3x3 on an earlier level was a bit tedious, but not too bad. \nIt's hard to see how the tiles are meant to be arranged as the lighting makes it kind of murky.\nAnd I can't face the thought of potentially having to do it repeatedly when I mess up the bit after it, which has a random bomb launcher.\n\nI'm leaving my review as positive, as I did enjoy the game up to this point.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504569935, "timestamp_created": 1504357022, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198073044042", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 1561, "last_played": 1504569976, "playtime_forever": 143}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34244410", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504063", "review": "This is a fun Sokoban game\n\nMake sure you pick \"controller\" under the options menu\n\n(Update)\nI'm happy to see there is now a \"contimue\" option, you no longer have to start over.\n\nIt would be nice if there was a \"rotate\" option...
