Please Steam, just make a third -neutral- recommendation option to make things easier to review. Ok?\n\nI got this game because it looked interesting to me. It has that minimalistic design I like, it plays smoothly, there are no bugs... but somehow I just can't sink in it. It's like I am not compatible with this game. It's just not for me even though I love puzzle games. To me it felt like the game doesn't force You to think, but rather click everything randomly until You find a solution.\n\nBut still, it's not a bad game, not at all. I'm totally sure it can find its own fans. I'm just not one of them. I still recommend it though, it's cheap and it's worth a try. Maybe I will come back to it because I know there are much more levels to solve, maybe then I'll change my review.
