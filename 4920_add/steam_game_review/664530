Some dialogues are downright hilariously unexpected and I've laughed quite a few times because of that. \n\nOverall the atmosphere really comes together with the music. It's surprisingly well written and sometimes catchy.\n\nFor the price and for what's advertised I really don't have anything negative to say about it.
