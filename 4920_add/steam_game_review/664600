I will leave a step by step guide at the bottom if anyone has any trouble.\n\nBut this game, is buggy and pure luck based and cost higher than it should. and if you're buying it for the scare, don't bother. it's not scary.\n1st entering the game I was calm, finally finishing the game I was bloody frustrated.\n\nSo the premise is that there is a girl roaming the house and you have to do puzzles which involves going to both floors of the house. The girl roaming \"can't see in the dark\" but the bloody kicker is, neither can you. So you can't do puzzles since pure darkness. You can hear footsteps but you have to guess if it's up stairs or downstairs. I would say listen to the doors and determine what it is but she randomly opens doors and leaves like crazy. If she spots you, for some reason the camera locks on her and you can't run as she runs faster then you. Sometimes though she'll run at you and just get stuck so you just carry on what you were doing. Sometimes she see's the flashlight through door and sometimes you'll experience the death scene over and over again just for annoyance.\n\nAs I say it's luck base, you have to get these items for the puzzle by going up and down and then get to an item box which I literally found by accident as I was about to turn off the game, with this one set of stairs so the chances of her seeing you on one floor is so incredibly high and remember...one look at your flash light and she insta kills you.\n\n The problem with this game is, there is no indication at all to do anything or have an appropriate system to counter her., yeah it ramps up the difficulty on this already luck based game but it ended up frustrating as I had to click on every dam item until something happened. \n\nSometimes I got this glowy thing that I called \"the atom of god\" that turned the bottom floor slightly red so you didn't need to use your flashlight to get detected which was good, when you got it though was so random. \n\nI was actually at the end and then my game crashed. Came back and loaded the game and was at the 2nd stage.\n\nAnd no offense to the actor used..but that acting was so wooden it was so cringe worthy and some dialog just kept on going. Props for the idea of the dev but this needs a lot of work. so at this point, i dont recommend it.\n\n\n1st part of the game is here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_sv0ZQDYDY\n\n\n*SPOILERS* PUZZLE ANSWERS\n===============================================\n[spoiler] 1) Just explore and get familiar with the lay out. Otherwise. there's a black picture frame in the room with the front door.\n2) activating the laptop in your room will give the hint. Turn ON the light in upstairs hall (just outside your room), tv room and the dinning room. They will make an electric sound. When done. go back to your room, there is a chest there which is now open with a piece of the picture and a key to open the opposite door.\n3) In the art room, there is pictures of locations in the house and a knife in the top left. Pick it up and mark the locations. Against the wall end of the hallway, wall half way down the stairs where the stairs turn, on the TV and the wall next to the phone. Go back into the room and in the chest will be a picture, a key to the next room and a gold key with you dont take notice of.\n4)DO NOT CLICK ON THE PICTURE FRAME IN THE CORNER! SAVE THAT FOR THE NEXT PART. in the room next to the art room is the next unlocked key and there is a long drawer which you need to correct key to open as new fake keys have appeared around the house. Now you see when I died it just opened but I had no idea it was what I was meant to do. So yeah, watch it if you die and could open. With the box inside with a picture and another key in for the bathroom next to your bedroom. (when continuing with the game, I noticed the key in the dinning room against the art picture would not respawn. Maybe thats it).\n\n5) This part is the most infuriating part of them all. You need to get 4 prescription meds and drink it with the bottle that is on the kitchen counter. The only kicker is you can only take one at a time. So there is one in the left corner of the art room. One in the bathroom counter. one to the corner of the living room (next to the picture of the eye) and one behind the TV. So thats 2 upstairs and 2 down stairs..can you see why this part is frustrating with that girl roaming around. So here's a tactic. sometimes when getting the one in the art room you get the atom of god (As i call it. can see a little bit down stairs) if you do. turn off your flash light and use it to navigate downstairs. get the other 2 downstairs as well leaving the one in the bathroom. At this point your light might go off. If y ou die for any reason use the other one in the room where you got the key for the bathroom. IF you have none like mine then this is down to pure luck. I got the 1st 3 and when facing the bottle. I turned my light off and head back into I was against the wall with the front door. Strife right and then forward to go up the stairs. and without using your light. go forward and slightly go left until you go into the bathroom (presuming its open). Listen to your footsteps to see where abouts you are and try to listen to her again. Do the exact same thing coming back out. when you reaach the bottom of the stairs you will hear one step that is particularly louder if that helps. get to the bottle and yay you pass out.\n6) IT'S NOT OVER! I THOUGHT THE MOODY COW WAS GONE BUT I RAN INTO HER, SHE GOT ME AND CRASHED MY GAME. be careful. You need to get to the phone. I did the exact same step as before as a security measure to make sure it didn't fuck it up for me again. listen to dialog.\n7) go back to the very 1st picture frame in the room with the eye.\n8) Done!\t[/spoiler]\n\nHope this helps.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501550434, "timestamp_created": 1501523328, "developer_response": "Hey, thanks for pointing out these issues.
