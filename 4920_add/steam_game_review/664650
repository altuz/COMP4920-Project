The player still needs to see the ball, but some frustrating missed opportunities have been reduced.\n\nTL;DR - budget indie title that has a good (and importantly, [b]fun[/b]) basis for a gridiron football game with some polish issues and limited to single matches/games (no season).\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\nThe foundations of a good football game are here. The selection of plays allows for varied offensive options, with competent AI to execute them and defensive AI that performs defensive schemes well. \n\nThe AI is very competent. On the offense, they form the pocket well, run their routes, and aren't supermen catching the ball (they have to see the ball coming). Defensively, AI reacts to motion before the snap, sticks with their men, reacts in zone coverage, and does a good job of deflecting passes fairly.\n\nArt assets are nice. Player models are decently modelled and there's a good variety in stadium design and details. There's also a lot of off-field characters, like the guys moving the chains and camermen on carts moving about. Varied weather effects are also nice to see.\n\nGood character. There's some humour to be found in the game and the motion captured animations of the players make the game more than robotic. Players celebrate or taunt when they deflect passes or score a touchdown, and show frustration when missing a field goal. The animations are a little jittery, but it's good to see an indie developer try to add character rather than it being a purely mechanical game. \n\nChallenging! There's a good variance in difficulty. In my first game, I was defeated quite badly, but as I gained confidence in the gameplay, I started to get better results, though I'm still having some tough losses. \n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\nLimited to single games. If you're into your franchise or season modes, you'll not find it here. Personally, I enjoy pick-up playing pick-up games, but I know some will feel this is lacking. \n\nLighting. While the art assets are nice, lighting is a bit bland, which makes the visuals look worse than they actually are. A comparison I'd make would be racing simulators like rFactor, where the models are nice, but the simplistic lighting lets it down a little. \n\nLack of polish in some areas. Certain assets, like menu icons and button prompts are fairly low res. While not a serious issue, it lowers the overall visual aesthetic of the game. Not a big issue, but you'll be aware you're playing a budget title. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nCanadian Football 17 is a competent game with a lot of fun to be had, albeit limited in scope. The important thing here is the mechanics of the game are good, so the football itself is fun to play. There's a good foundation to build upon for updates or sequels, so for those seeking a career or franchise mode, there is at least a good game to build upon. If playing the game for the sake of playing isn't enough for you, then you'll want to sit this one out. I'm personally having a lot of fun playing the single matches, but I understand this won't be enough for some. \n\nNB - there is also a play designer, though I haven't looked at this yet. The plays that are in the playbook as standard are competent and varied enough for a casual player like me, though I may delve in to it later.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501357495, "timestamp_created": 1501116286, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197986589267", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 244, "last_played": 1505347358, "playtime_forever": 642}, "votes_up": 13, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33818665", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510723", "review": "Fairly frustrating game with wonky passing mechanics(No appaarent attempt to catch passes when wide open is very annoying to me), clunky maneuvering while and controls, also no ability to try out plays and see how one is supposed work a given and no concept of a season mode at all.

Sure it has potential to become something in the future, but as of right now, I just cannot recommend spending $16 dollars on this game.  I hate Madden, I hate the NFL, I wanted to be able to love this game, especially since this game being good would be great for the sports video game market... but this game is basically boiled down to the on-field action (no season, franchise, stat tracking... all the things you want from a sports game), and the on-field action isn't very good.  If you want to buy this game just to spite Madden or to expand the competition, I totally respect that, but I think the average sports gamer is going to find this game lacking in too many areas to really enjoy it.\n\nPlaying defense is a nightmare... the controls are slippery and unintuitive... it took me 3 quarters of a game to figure out that RT was the tackle button, and even after that I wasn't entirely sure that RT was the tackle button.  The pre-snap controls are equally as baffling (RB/LB to cycle players?  Y to call a timeout?  Why???).  Most of us have been Maddenized by this point, why not just make the control scheme similar?  Be different in presentation, be different in how the game feels on the field, but please don't make me learn an entirely new control scheme - especially not  one that makes zero sense.  I was ready to throw my laptop through the window after the 3rd time I got called for delay of game for accidentally calling at timeout that I didn't have (again, WHY MAP IT TO THE Y BUTTON????)  Of course, the first time I got called for it was after I kicked off, and the delay of game triggered the other team to have to kick to me... so that was an unexpected glitch in my favor :)\n\nOffensively, I enjoyed the presnap motion, I feel like they nailed that pretty well... I am a big CFL fan, and all the pre-snap movement is something I really enjoy... it's just hard to see your outside receivers, so expect to get nailed with the occasional offsides.  The passing game feels okay... there's some animations missing that could make it better, but for the most part it feels competent... running after the catch is a decent amount of fun.  DB AI is not the best though, so you are not going to see much resembling a contested catch/battle for the football.  Basically, if the DB is going to knock it down, the ball is either going to hit him in the back of the head, or he's going to stand in front of your WR and jump straight up and down a few times... and maybe pick off a pass here and there.  The running game is fairly non-existent from what I can tell.  My biggest gripe offensively lies in the QB within the pocket game... He feels like he's about 100 years old shuffling around until either a DL hurls his body into him, or the DL decide not to rush and you can finally get him outside of the pocket.  After years of playing newere football games, it doesn't feel very good.\n\nAll in all, I just can't recommend this game to the average football fan.  Maybe CFL fans who are harder core than I am will like it, but I see most people begrudgingly accepting their football video game fate (ie, it's Madden or nothing).  If you're comitted to trying to build a brand other than Madden, than by all means, buy the game and hope the developer continues to support this series, because you can see some glimmers of potential (one of those \"everyone's got to start somewhere\" kind of things).  Me?  I'm going to refund it, because $16 is just too much for me to drop on the hope that this will some day turn into an awesome series.  If/when it gets there, I'll be more than happy to buy it, but my video game budget is currently too limited to purchase a game that I don't enjoy and that I'm not going to play.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501961112, "timestamp_created": 1501961112, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198094734456", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 69, "last_played": 1501958633, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34044846", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501144", "review": "It's very basic, but you can tell they're focussing on making a game that plays well at its core instead of trying to recreate Madden.
