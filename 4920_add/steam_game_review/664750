It's nice to see an early access survivel game that is already playable and without any game breaking bugs. As someone with a computer that leaves alot to be desired I do appreiate the low poly artstyle and the fact that it's still easy on the eyes. \n\nThere's a also a few events that can happen at random which makes the game more alot more interesting. Wrongworld is alot harder then it looks and it has permadeath enabled. On the upside after you die you can earn exp and level up which unlocks items that can help you in your next run. \n\nMy only gripe is the combat could be a little better, You can easily stunlock enemies by repeatedly wacking them. \n\nI really hope this dosn't turn into minecraft, Jamie please don't sell wrongworld to microsoft or any other big company because they will ruin it without question. \n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506341833, "timestamp_created": 1506341833, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1082, "steamid": "76561198138054873", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 30, "last_played": 1507013570, "playtime_forever": 1549}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34847498", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496166", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1505002692, "review": "The game has potential, but it's only got a couple hours of content so far.

It is definitely a game about winning... but you just might have to die a few times (or a lot of times) to get to that point! :) I try to ensure the deaths in Wrongworld are never unfair, and, fingers crossed, you learn something from each death and do better next time. Plus there's the unlockable reward system, so at least you get something to soften the blow!\n\nI will be adding a separate mode without perma-death, so you might want to come back in future and try that so you can better explore the existing content because, I promise you, there is already many, many hours' worth of content in there... it's just not necessarily apparent until you delve deeper, explore more, and build more things/unlock more advanced crafting structures. However, that's my completely subjective opinion, and I'm obviously a little biased! But rest assured, I will be tirelessly working to add more and more content over the coming months, so I hope you give it another try one day :)", "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014982753", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 35, "last_played": 1505051751, "playtime_forever": 228}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
