Combat was tactical and satisfying, with the ability to decide just how you want to approach it. What I especially enjoyed is that whilst for one area you may find a dominant strategy of attacks and skills, it wont remain an unbeatable combo forever. This means there is a good reward for discovering good strategies, but it doesnt lead to an easy and therefore boring game. The final area and boss don't mess around, and I won only by the skin of my teeth with smart play, which felt great!\n\nAlso given that there is multiple weapon types there is probably at least 3 if not more different playthroughs you could do emphasing different gear and weaponsets.\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503657282, "timestamp_created": 1503657282, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198008867850", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 68, "last_played": 1503656898, "playtime_forever": 110}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34367096", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "I enjoyed playing through Ether Awakening.

The days of random battles are long past.\n-- Quick normal battles - The normal battles do not take long, especially if you know what you are doing. Having just one character to control definitely helps.\n-- Good quality overall - Good writing, very good music, good level designs.\n-- Some strategy required - Bosses have strategies, too bad the game gets too easy middle-way (see below).\n-- Interesting equipments - not just upgrades over your old gear, you have to think before you equip.\n-- And last (but not least): The game was ENJOYABLE. Not once during my playthrough did I get bored. And that is the most important thing in a game in my book; Being fun.\n\nI disliked\n---------\n--The difficulty. Halfway through the game becomes very very easy. At least that happened to me, and I know I did not overfarm enemies. If you don't skip enemies, and search the areas for loot and buffs, you will breeze though the game no problem. At least till you reach the final boss, that will send you packing if you are not truly prepared.\n--A little rushed - While the game is quite polished, it shows that it could have been given a little more time from the creator. The last dungeons are quite barren dialogue-wise and event-wise, and there are places where your character can walk up walls etc.\n\nSummary:\nI definitely recommend this game for anyone that wants a quick rpg fix during a break from more demanding games. This is not a game you will remember for the rest of your life, but it's a good worth for its money.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503781717, "timestamp_created": 1503781717, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198104626891", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 14, "last_played": 1503779920, "playtime_forever": 401}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
