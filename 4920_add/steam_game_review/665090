It's just way too annoying when you only use your keyboard&mouse to move around the in-game camera especially in this fast-tempo game. I really love the Japanese voice actors. I understand how much investments the developers had paid for those fancy voice actors, but I don't think all the voices are well-matched with all the in-game characters. I'm not talking about how the characters' mouth moves when they speak (well, that also need to be fixed for perfection). I'm talking about the faces, how would you have no emotional reacts when you are talking to someone with an emotional voice?

I haven't had any problems installing or getting the game running (for the few short minutes I played it). I do not recommend this game because of the lack of mouse support. It does support the use of a keyboard. I feel less like I'm playing an action game and more like I'm playing the piano. The default layout for the keyboard doesn't really allow for good camera control. Left hand you're controlling movement. Right hand you're controlling attacks. Unless I grow another arm controlling the camera this way is out of the question. Controller support is also available and recommended by most. However I feel more immersed playing with the keyboard and mouse combo.\n - No online co-op (being able to play with friends would be amazing as well)\n\n9.24.17 - Completed easy and normal difficulty.\n- Content is lacking. I would prefer more freedom. There is nearly nothing in existance and enemys spawn in waves as you enter the next area. Objects, obstacles, health and energy items would be a nice addition maybe breakable objects with rewards inside. The world seems very flat with nothing to be found. The money you earn to buy skills (very few skills) once complete there is no use for it.\n- Jumping gaps feels very limited. While jumping straight up gives you quite a bit of height you lack horizonal movemnt. Sprint + Jump doesn't seem to increase the horizontal distance you can leap. To get maximum distance horizontally you have to jump, jump, block (air dash).\n- Auto targeting. While this is a nice feature because I can't aim with the camera it takes away from my control and I'm left feeling like the computer is playing for me.\n- Unique skill. This is over powered one shot kill everything thats not a boss. Also I'm not doing anything computer is doing all the work.\n- Execution. Strong attack while an enemy has red sparks coming off of them. This also feels lacking I have no control over the execution or which animation it does.\n- Enemy grab. No way to break free unless you use unique skill.\n- Overall Conclusion at this point in time is the game is very short and fun to play. I like the fast paced hack and slash. This is not something most people will spend more than few hours playing if they can live with the controls and camera.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506290613, "timestamp_created": 1505848980, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 292, "steamid": "76561198209760825", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 19, "last_played": 1506360458, "playtime_forever": 370}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35071757", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485525", "review": "This game is stupid...ah...stupid COOL.
