Playing this on windows mode can be quite difficult as everything looks small, but putting it on full screen by opening the option screen(F1) doesn't really help either since the game will suffer from low fps. I dont know if this because of my machine or something else, but that's my experience when i'm playing on full screen. \n\nDespite all of that, the game is pretty decent, especially if you are a pervert like me. It has good art and a standard turn-based mechanic. But then again, if you do want to buy this game, get it when it's on steam sale or discount. Yes, indeed the game is just around 2dollar, but i recommend you to buy it when the price is lower.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505524980, "timestamp_created": 1505524980, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198233218292", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 53, "last_played": 1505524962, "playtime_forever": 104}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35304302", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504119", "review": "hmmm.................What can I say. \n\nI'm a simple guy.
