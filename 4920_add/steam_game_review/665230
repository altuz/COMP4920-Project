I quite enjoy minimalistic puzzle games, but I just can't recommend this one due to a large number of factors that just led to the game being unenjoyable for me (specifically visuals, audio, 'missing' features, and level design). My primary grievance was just the aesthetic of the game itself. While the whole neon theme of 'Glowing Sokoban' seemed neat in theory, in practice when coupled with the moving background it just hurt to look at after just a few consecutive levels. They did add options to disable the moving background, which I quickly toggled and left off, but this doesn't affect the title screen. Even with this off though the neon colors of the elements with a flat background hurt to look at if I played for too long in one sitting, and this detracted a lot from the game's experience.\n\nThe music also didn\u2019t help at all. Although the game boasts '13 soundtracks', they are all fairly short loops that sound very similar and quickly became annoying. What made the music unbearable to me was the fact that a different track would be selected every time you beat a level or restarted, and it did so by very harshly cutting off the previous track and beginning the new one. On top of that, the background color scheme changes at the same time, which furthers the visual grievances I mentioned above. When I turned off the dynamic backgrounds, I also muted all the music of the game.\n\nThe game is also lacking in a few gameplay features that I would have expected. There is no level select option, each level just leads to the next. If you load up a save once you've beaten all the levels it just takes you to the end game screen from where you can only return to the main menu, so at any time you can only ever access the next level in an existing save or create a new save. The game had a reset level option (bound to 'r', as seemed natural), but there was no button to step back a single move (which I would have expected on 'backspace'). To make that issue worse, not every input would be registered, so when moving along a long path, I would often stop too early and ruin the level because some key presses were lost, and without a backspace option I was forced to then restart the level. When completing a level, it would sometimes take a few seconds to register the victory, and during that time if you moved a piece you could be forced into a state where you have to start completely over (this happened once to me). And while the game describes itself as \"You need to place all the blue rings on the red squares at the least number of moves\", the number of moves taken is completely irrelevant. It does track how many move you make, but there is no incentive to minimize that, unless you want to go back and one-up yourself (which you'll need to start a new playthough and beat all levels up to that point to even attempt).\n\nThe levels design also seemed lacking. The levels were of a huge variety of difficulties, and mildly difficult levels would be sometimes followed with several trivially easy ones. Among the 60 levels, a few were at least mildly challenging, and a single one had me stumped for around 20 minutes. Even the hard levels didn't feel satisfying to complete, the difficulty just felt like an annoyance. Many of the levels would also have portions that were pointless, like pieces that started in their goal position and never moved or unusable areas of the map. This led to levels that have numerous possible solutions, and many where the solution was visually obvious from the moment the level was presented. Take for example level 27: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1132003033 The one square at the top is completely unusable, but so is the entire section to the right of the map. Not only is it pointless, but with the mechanics of the game, it is fundamentally unusable. Things like these lead most levels to have sections that just go unused and don't add to the game in any way.\n\nWith the dynamic background and audio disabled, it is a passable puzzle game, and the fundamental mechanics do work, despite the missing features that one would expect from a game such as this, so it is probably best to give this game a pass.
