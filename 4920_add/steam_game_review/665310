It's  hard to deploy un-noticed,I think \" Civil War Bull Run\" handled this a bit better.But those gripes apart there is not much else to moan about.There are different campaigns ,various settings for each , and these are interesting, largely forgotten battles...And they are quite tough scraps -  I let the Commonwealth down badly and got creamed by some Japanese paras who just kept infiltrating my crumbling defences.  It's tactically sound  and requires  hard fighting and the right tactics.                                                                                                                                                 Ok, in the time I played I encountered no bugs ,crashes or hangups it ran nicely and unbothered on Windows 7x 64 bit.The music and the sound effects are  great.There was nothing  that  seemed silly or unlkely...                                                        I think ,this is a good game and real value for money.....", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501415603, "timestamp_created": 1501409994, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038466696", "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 211, "last_played": 1501495741, "playtime_forever": 507}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
