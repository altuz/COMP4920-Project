But anyways, it's a pretty fun game, even though it can be very annoying at times, but it's still fun. My favorite mode is the booking Career mode.

This interface. This is the first time I have ever requested a refund of a game based solely on those two things, but you have to see it to believe it. Playing this game is like trying to drive a car that doesn't have a steering wheel. \n\nI'll try and break it down...\n\nBOOKING CAREER:\n\nI tried a booking career first because that's what I really wanted to do. I send the wrong wrestlers out there quite often... somtimes the wrestlers on the card aren't the same as the guys who walk out, and other times I accidently click the wrong button. That's easier to do than you think, because the game has this bizarre hybrid controller/keyboard configuration that doesn't work at all, and there are no prompts like \"Are you sure you want to send this injured guy out to wrestle?\". Whenever you push a button, the effects are immediate and completely irreversible.\n\nIt's easy to screw up contract negotiations like this, too. All I can tell you about that is that the A button increases the amount of money you're offering, the X button lowers it, and there is seemingly no way to adjust the duration of a contract even though the appearance of the screen leads you to believe that you can. If you hit B, it cancels the negotations altogether and you won't be able to reopen them again until the following week.\n\nI can't count the number of times that I said something like, \"No, wait... FUCK!!!!\", trying to get this game to do what I want it to do, clicking the wrong button, and having everything get messed up. You wouldn't think that would be a problem with the booking part of the game, with a management sim, but it sure is.\n\nYou are also required to control either one of the wrestlers, or the referee, or a manager during the match phase, which doesn't make much sense if all you're trying to do is book matches.\n\nThe way the wrestlers are presented in lists is a disaster, too. They're in no particular order, and without specifically clicking on the wrestler you won't know things like his/her age or tag team partner.\n\nSo booking didn't work out.\n\nWRESTLING CAREER:\n\nI wanted to book, but that wasn't happening so I tried to wrestle. Opened the tutorial.\n\nMy first task was to 'double tap' to dash forward. Fooling around with the controls, I accidently switched the wrestler I was controlling and took over the coach who was training me. Why would you want to do things like that, as a player? Anyway, I got my own guy back and never did get a dash going, unless a forward roll is a dash. While I was working on this double tap, the coach picked up a metal chair and started beating the crap out of me with it, which hindered my efforts to learn the controls somewhat.\n\nIt's crazy because in all respects Wrestling Revolution 3D seems like a game I would really like. But it's just all over the place with the controls.
