Second time will feel a little more comfy. Third time you'll be getting into it. And you probably will like it.\n\nThis game concept is unique and unusual but it feels fun and challenging. The idea is to \"grind\" and \"gravitate\" planetoids to rise the volume and earn points. Each song and each time is different. \n\nYou can add your own mp3 files to the game and play with it. Split screen is fun as hell to play with friends while you listen to your fav music. \n\nIf you like odd music beat game gems, this is for you.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503349475, "timestamp_created": 1503349475, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971501811", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 161, "last_played": 1503350683, "playtime_forever": 72}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34270793", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494843", "review": "EDIT : Changing my review to recommended, as the dev is active and already fixed a few problems. That's a \"cautious recommendation\" though, and for people who enjoy playing with their music.\n\nIt could be a good game, but :\n\n- 3 crashes in not even 2 hours => FIXED after first update it seems\n- unclear about how to score (or lose) points (case in point : on the same song, playing the same way, I made 400 points once, 8000 another time)\n- no remapping of keyboard inputs\n- relationship between music and level not quite apparent (to me)\n- moving your \"ship\" is pretty much a pita\n- minor : strange white border around the screen => FIXED after 1st update\n- overall, no real idea of what you're supposed to do\n- no answer from devs about all the above in 2 days (granted, that's just 2 days, but still ...)\n\nFor these reasons, I can't recommend this game at the moment. It feels more like an early access title than a finished product, honestly.
