If all goes well that night, this game can be wildly entertaining and hilarious. Like, gut-ripping, extensive laughs can be had.\n\nHowever, there's a few things that can make the game really f*cking annoying and almost unplayable.\n\nThe first and most blatantly evident issue I have with this game is that there is no order sometimes. At all. In order for a stand up room or battle room to work, the players have to simply cooperate together so that the performer or performers can tell their jokes or rap their bars, then the audience listens and decides to heckle or vote off from there. However, this rarely happens. You need a room full of the right people. Otherwise, it all goes to sh*t.\n\nIn most rooms you enter, there's total random chaos. It can be entertaining from time to time, but it mostly makes for a nonsensical and annoying experience. Like, you can jump into a rap battle room and sit there for 45 mins and it will just be kids and dudes screaming, blowing on their mics, and shouting nonsense the entire time. People get voted off for no reason at all, and the people on stage do the same sh*t the audience does. Sure, there will be a laugh or two, but at some point, you think \"Why buy a game with a specific stand up, singing, and rap battle performance theme and just get on to scream ramdonly the entire time?\"\n\nI'd like to say to the devs that there should be options for the room admins to allow a bit of order. I don't care if some people want to act totally insane in their rooms, but you should be allowed to create an environment in your room where there are some kind of rules. \n\nRoom admins should be allowed to:\n\n*set timers for each person rapping or telling jokes or singing\n*create an amount of rounds when each person can rap or tell jokes\n*disable voting or save voting for after said amount of rounds are complete\n*mute the audience while people are rapping or doing stand up\n*add beats(if they choose) to be played on a music player within the game and not via speakers into your mic\n\n\nAgain, the game is capable of being insane amounts of fun. When people are being cooperative, the stand up can be super hilarious and the battles can be epic as f*ck or hilarious as f*ck. However, it's mostly just everyone cutting each other off to yell inaudibly, screaming nonsense over one another, just voting people off the stage before they've even said anything, and nonsensical choas. If room admins could implement some order to their rooms, then everyone wins because the people who just wanna f*ck around and scream for no reason and say random stuff can have fun in their own rooms and the people who wanna have fun listening to each other's stand up and raps can do the same. \n\nAt the current state, I can't recommend this game to everyone, then again it's only $5, so I'd say it's worth a try if $5 isn't anyhing to you. But, if the changes I mentioned can be added, this game could be absolutely amazing. I love the concept and I was so stoked when I found out about this game. With it's flaws, I've had moments while playing where I was doubled over on the floor, absolutely dying. And while those experiences were totally worth it, it really sours it when it's mostly jumping from room to room for a few hours until you find one that isn't just screaming and nonsense.\n", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": "9", "votes_funny": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505007518, "timestamp_created": 1505007518, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 493, "steamid": "76561198246267750", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 24, "last_played": 1507057464, "playtime_forever": 1456}, "votes_up": 111, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34898056", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640473", "review": "Every American server is full of memes\nEvery European server's full of drunk people \nEvery Asian server's full of weebs that fap to a animated character and rap about some naruto\nHad a rap battle against Donald Trump and won\nDefinitely will play again\n11/10\n\n", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 53, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505210319, "timestamp_created": 1505210319, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "steamid": "76561198206180284", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 134, "last_played": 1506539542, "playtime_forever": 798}, "votes_up": 100, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34785044", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625609", "review": "It's like when you're in grade school and the teacher leaves the room for a minute and all the kids start screaming the N word in unison infinitely.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504741046, "timestamp_created": 1504741026, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "steamid": "76561197972635749", "num_reviews": 143, "num_games_owned": 2269, "last_played": 1506643424, "playtime_forever": 774}, "votes_up": 87, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35059760", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589360", "review": "It may have a lot of ground beef jokes, but they're still funnier than Amy Schumer.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 35, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505806944, "timestamp_created": 1505806944, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "steamid": "76561198005741527", "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 369, "last_played": 1506039759, "playtime_forever": 205}, "votes_up": 67, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34834483", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576320", "review": "Best 20 min of autistic screeching.
