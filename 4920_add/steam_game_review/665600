From the music, the sound effects, and the layouts (many of which seem copied directly and then recoloured), to even the characters (a crow...seriuosly?), this is just Rusty Lake...except you have to pay money for this one.  The Cube Escape games are freeware, so what's this game's excuse?\n\nWith stolen music, layouts, characters, and tone, I would avoid this game at all costs and play Cube Escape or drop some money down on the Rusty Lake spinoffs and avoid this game and their attempt to cash-in on stolen assets and ideas from a free game.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501621206, "timestamp_created": 1501621206, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198262374327", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 641, "last_played": 1501622955, "playtime_forever": 38}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
