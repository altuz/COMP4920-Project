First the camera filter its all smokey specially in the train statin area making it difficult to see everything.Second its so damn dark again its hard to see anything even after you get the camera which btw after maybe 20 or so seconds of use was running out of power.Being able to remap some controls would be nice as well. Also I don't see any function tied to the left and right arrows keys. When pickup up items well its too floaty. The first thing I picked up rotated in a way where I couldn't even read the newspaper clipping.Smooth out these few issues and you possibly have a pretty good game. When I can see things they look pretty good the story from what little I got before I just walked away for now I probably will come back to it later seems good so far.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506272972, "timestamp_created": 1506272972, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "steamid": "76561198000898895", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 534, "last_played": 1506272420, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35191958", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502688", "review": "This game actually has a very good atmosphere that makes me feel terrified.
