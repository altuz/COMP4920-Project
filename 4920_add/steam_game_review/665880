This makes it frustrating when you're trying to walk and look in another direction at the same time, and I do that a lot. The graphics don't look great, but they don't look bad either. The scale of everything in the game can sometimes look a little off. The audio is lacking. I hear my own footsteps louder than almost everything else in a disaster situation!? It's just jarring when audio is clearly missing from things, objects fall onto the ground in silence, etc, etc. The frame rate also constantly dipped a little bit. It's a minor dip, yet frequent enough to be annoying.\n\nI stopped playing about 15 minutes in the game because the key card I needed to open a door disappeared after climbing into a vent. The card didn't respawn back in it's default location. I'm going to refund this one unfortunately. It does have the potential to be a decent experience if they fix these issues.\n\nMy specs: \nGTX 970\nI5-6600k\n16GBs RAM", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499820123, "timestamp_created": 1499819808, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971200127", "num_reviews": 82, "num_games_owned": 440, "last_played": 1499819005, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
