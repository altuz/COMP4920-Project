(which made me uncertain and on guard towards something I couldn't change once it happened)\nThe brakes - prob. also throttle - did not seem like they were analog, while at the same time not seeming properly digital (as in instant on/off) either.\n\nWith that out of the way I did get pretty much what I was expecting, a silly little racer that's fun and hard, not due to sim. racing perfection but due to being hard to drive fast and gather everything, like getting all the rings in Sonic hard.\nI like it for what it is, a time waster, a silly little game I can play while uploading to YouTube and such, it is a replacement for Minesweeper so to say...\n\nI can not recommend it to anyone but I can not tell everyone to stay away either, I like it and so may you but you may also hate it completely, it is the type of game that is hard to review due to not really being a game that there's one you can compare it to. (I feel like I should compare it more to that \"Cooking witch game\" than anything else I can come up with...)\n\nThis is most likely the most confusing review you've found on Steam and that is due to me feeling very confused about the game and what it tried to be while still liking hat I got while feeling a bit frustrated about a little bit within it.\n\nSo, for closure I'll say this:\nIt never got me frustrated from the oddities that happened, I just laughed and kept on playing.
