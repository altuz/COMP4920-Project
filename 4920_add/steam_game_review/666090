But in a good way, it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you play through it. I feel the game is fair in many ways but I personally would like to recommed some things to improve it.. Now first before I say anything YES I do understand this is still in Early Access and is labeled as one but none the less these suggestions would be to help the game not hurt it.. (Unlike some other reviewers for other games) \n\nFirst off the game has pretty terrible language throughout it, not in swearing or bad words but instead in proper english, some words are not spelled correctly or dont make sense with the sentence. \n\nSecound is the fact that theres lots of parts missing, the black boxes to the left of the elites and people dont have anything in them? I would suggest adding maybe a number between 1-99 to keep it simple for when the elites or people might attack.\n\nThird when picking a specific person to represent you It would be nice to add a feature where you can switch between the woman or man, this probably wont make adifference but it can get pretty repetitive. \n\nFourth is some bugs I found while playing, the game had a few bugs where I reached power level 5 and never got the achievement.\n\nIn summary all I think this game needs is more diversity and a few areas to improve upon, more content would make this game a smash hit like the game 'Sort The Court'. Its a rather challenging games which can keep you entertained for about an hour or two and also has great re-playability value for it. And for the Dev I know it can be hard only having one person, but as the first person to review your game, PLEASE keep adding to it! Make it perfect in your eyes and keep pressing forward. This CAN be a great game and maybe even an Iphone and Android game???\n\n~PLAYER\n\n", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506909903, "timestamp_created": 1506909903, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "steamid": "76561198343713269", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 20, "last_played": 1506985324, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
