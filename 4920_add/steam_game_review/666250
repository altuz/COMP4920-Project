There should really be a meh \"middle thumb\" option.\n\nPros\n-LOVE the music, whoever made it i love you.\n-Incredible potential to something huge.\n-Price isn't bad.\n-Amazing concept - I just love it.\n\nCons\n-Annoying DJ, restricting movement whenever he speaks.\n-Extremely long respawn times for a game that involves lots of trial and error.\n-Sometimes the platforms do not register a bounce causing me to walk off the edge.\n-Tiny FOV making it difficult to aim properly.\n-Movement feels delayed and hard to control.\n\nOverall needs more work and more features for it to live up to its \u00a37 price tag, but keep this in your library until it blows up :).", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502631686, "timestamp_created": 1502631686, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198045880045", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 58, "last_played": 1502631417, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
