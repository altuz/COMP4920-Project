It might seem strange at first, but once you understand the controls it's a smooth learning experience. For those with past experience with bhopping, be aware that this game is simpler in style than your go-to CS:Source bhop server. There is a speed limit at 1,250 units per second, no speed is gained from circle jumping or strafing in mid-air, and bhops are easy to do.\n\nDespite its simplicity (in contrast to older games alike), an interesting difference is that the best approach to a faster speedrun is going in a straight line, as opposed to bhopping in Source engine games where you need to strafe between every jump to gain speed. It feels like a combination of the smooth mouse movement in surfing, and the constant jumps from bhopping.\n\nFinally, the game also has double jumping. The timing is tricky: jump too early and you go too high, too late and you barely ascend at all. A great feature in my opinion, it adds for variety when looking for the optimal route in a level.\n\n// Visuals\n\nThe game was created in Unreal Engine 4, and it looks [u]stunning[/u]. The graphic options, though, are few and simple. There's no choice to disable motion blur, which can be distracting, as well as bloom effects. Framerate can be capped at several intervals, the UI has both a simple setting with just speed and time, and an advanced one that offers some more data on the top-left corner.\nThe overall tone is somewhat dark, with lights on walls and floors to light up the big, spacious rooms where you run. (At least the stock ones, we'll have to see what people create and upload to the workshop).\n\n// Sound\n\nNot much to be said, although the sound when you bhop reminds me of the \"Uh\" from when you jump in Doom. A soundtrack would be nice, but for now, there's no background music aside from the menu.\n\n// Bugs\n\nMinimal: sometimes you hear a thud when landing on a platform even though it's already too late to jump off of it, sometimes sliding results in no running sound after you stop sliding.\n\n// Overall\n\nI adore games that are simple to pick up but difficult to master, because this means that the gameplay is balanced and carefully planned. When properly executed, you get classics like Rocket League, Portal, and the like. Having experience in this kind of games, I don't need more than an hour of playing Inertia to be able to tell that I'll be enjoying it and discovering everything it has to offer. If the developers are careful enough to listen to their audience, and devoted enough to keep adding content to the game, this will no doubt become the game that those who reminisce in their memories of running in source games go to.\n\nFour bucks means it's a steal, but a game this good on its day of release AND on early access?
