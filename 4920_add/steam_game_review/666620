Had some issues with the download but the developer fixed it within 12 hours. (def brownie points there).  I am not one to judge for horror because nothing scares me. Im sure others would think creepy maze games are scary, but I have yet to find a game in VR or PC that actually \"scares me\". So if you're a person that gets creeped out easily, you would like this.  \nMust give props to the developer though. Its not some big A+ studio creating it. He's a single developer and I respect that As an artist I know that creating stuff for others is tough! \n\nOverall, for the $2.59, helps support the artist. Hes got a great idea-just need to expand it. Well worth the 3 bucks. There are games that are $9.99 that are way worse!", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503092690, "timestamp_created": 1503092690, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198385217110", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 21, "last_played": 1503110107, "playtime_forever": 316}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34426465", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418487", "review": "i want to recommend this game as the graphics for an indie game are quite good. they did a very good job of making a scary atmosphere. however the problem is the lack of anything worth while. all together there is a total of 2 semi jumpscares and thats it. no monster or any real way to lose. the story is also janky and feels like you're playing a sequal. not to mention numerous bugs. and all together it took about 20 minutes to beat.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHQImZR2XoU&feature=youtu.be", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503446372, "timestamp_created": 1503446347, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036777325", "num_reviews": 103, "num_games_owned": 152, "last_played": 1503431029, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34463178", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497715", "review": "Gameplay is roughly 20 minutes.
