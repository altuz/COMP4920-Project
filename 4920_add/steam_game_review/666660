Very old game so don't expect otherwise, but there's a lot of fun if nothing else seeing how well you can mess with the old simplistic path-finding and AI, and it's a reasonably fun game designing castles, managing workers, army, and their wages, and how that effects your budget, and if you turn on \"messengers\" you get a number of interesting stories that play out during the game.\n\nThis isn't Medieval Total War though.  You have two troop types, archers and soldiers, they're literally 6 pixels, and you can only place them before battle.  You can't control them at all once the battle starts, but there is a surprising amount of strategy involved in that, where you put your archers in the castle, how you break up your ground troops and whether you put them inside or outside the castle or in various nooks of your castle so they tend to end up massing around small numbers of enemy troops at the same time.  Managing finances is about on par with modern games and adds a reasonable extra layer to the game, The order your build your castle in is important because you will get attacked while it is being built, and you have to prioritize how to get some basic defenses while at the same time thinking long term, and the non-linear stories you get out of the game are actually well written and interesting.\n\nIt's also only $10.  On sale it's practically free.  If nothing else it's worth the money just to give it a try.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500870257, "timestamp_created": 1500870257, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984586984", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 293, "last_played": 1501482384, "playtime_forever": 2778}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
