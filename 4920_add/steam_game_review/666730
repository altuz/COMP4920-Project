The charming random events of the early game slow to a trickle, and ambushes diminish to effectively zero as you upgrade your cart. Newly unlocked areas don't seem to pose any additional challenge, though they do allow for new random events -- but by the time you reach them they happen exceedingly rarely. The reputation system is one-sided, and hired guns don't stick around long enough to make combat missions profitable, except in the early game, where you're hiring them anyway -- so in the long run, you're basically railroaded into earning your money through trade and escort missions exclusively. Features like loyalty and guild houses are superficially implemented but seem to have no actual bearing on the gameplay mechanics.

There are times when I click to go to the next city that it sends me back to the previous city and makes me travel again to the current city I am at. That would not be that aggrivating if it did not take away from my hired soldiers travel counter. In a resource managment game it is all about earning the maximum amount of money and to quickly be loosing money just from a bug is really frusterating.\n\n2. I saved the game and left, then came back in and some of my carts storage points had decreased and I had more items than storage and I had an event that gave me items and suddenly I had negative item amounts which was really confusing.\n\n3. The most frusterating issue and made me rage quit for now is the fact that I got to the end of the month ready to pay 10,000 coin and move to level three and ready to do more upgrading, but what ended up happening is the game took my 10,000 coin and just moved me to level 2.... not 5,000 coin.. 10,000 coin and then is going to make me wait another month.. so that is a big one for me... I will try back maybe in a week or two to see if this has been resolved... until these issues are resolved my negative review stands.\n\nAlso some minor things\n\n-When I minimize the game, the game completely disappears from anything except control panel, I could not repull the game up or anything. I had to force quit and then relaunch it. I have never struggled with this with anything ever before.\n\n-The save system is frusterating. The only way to save the game is to quit... That is really annoying as a person who likes to frequently save to just back up a game I have to leave the game and go back in which seems to make the first three problems I mentioned even worse.\n\nAgain I really want to like the game so I will not be returning it but I really hope the first three issues are fixed, because besides those issues it was quite enjoyable and relaxing after a long day from work.\n\nLooking foward to checking out updates as they come out.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503114161, "timestamp_created": 1503114074, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198051691480", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 282, "last_played": 1503109238, "playtime_forever": 101}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34309538", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501240", "review": "This is one of the most charming titles ive played in a long time. \nSimple. \nFun. \nRewarding. 8/10. \nEverything from the aesthetics down the functionality of the game are top notch. \nOver the last 24 hours the game has been updated beyond recognition and it has a strong future.\nPotential for a cult classic if it ever overflows with content. \nAs it stands though ive currently maxed out the game. \nBinge playing mind you.. \nI want that gold..  at half price... \nThen i'll wheel next door and sling it for triple profit..\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502984018, "timestamp_created": 1502984018, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068127558", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 32, "last_played": 1502964829, "playtime_forever": 341}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34405277", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500419", "review": "Cool game!

This Merchant Life provides a pleasant and engaging experience of hunting for the best deals while trying to stay alive (economically and somewhat literally).  The trading system responds to your buying and selling, so you can't keep making the same great sale again for awhile.  And the need to hire guards for your wagon is a constant tax on your resources; when a lot of your capital is tied up in goods, you may need to make a risky move even into the mid-game.  The combat system itself is appropriately simple for an economically focused game, but you'll still have to make some hard choices, and in some encounters likely never feel safe.\n\nOne really great thing about this game is the writing.  It's just cheeky enough to be really enjoyable without ever feeling like it's trying too hard.  You get a flavor for the Kingdom of Peregrine, a medieval, slightly fantasy kingdom with numerous quirky towns.  And, reading the town's flavor text often clues you in to what trade is most lucrative in a town, a nice bonus.\n\nThis game is still in early access and literally under development.  While I did encounter several bugs, they were all minor oddities.  There seem to be placeholders for some of the content of the game (\"Heroes\" are mentioned in several places, but I never encountered them).  And the balancing needs some work; late game becomes almost trivial with a fully upgraded cart (allowing you to avoid all random encounters, meaning you don't need to hire guards) and the highest tier of goods to buy/sell (easily netting you ten thousands of gold in a haul, completing the final few goals in just a few minutes).  But again, this is to be expected in a game that is literally still in development.\n\nI think this has the makings of a wonderful game, particularly for the low price ($8.99 when I purchased not on sale).  One feature I hope to see in a future release is a randomized map.  That would significantly improve the replay value.  As this game develops further, I will definitely be coming back to see how it's improved.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503707783, "timestamp_created": 1503158393, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017209290", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 42, "last_played": 1505123026, "playtime_forever": 513}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34404183", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503715", "review": "In its current state, the game is too buggy to receive a positive review from me.\n\nThat being said, I can see a lot of potential in it.
