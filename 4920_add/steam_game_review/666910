You will find items amongst various storage containers and objects, resources you can use to craft items that will help you complete your mission and otherwise improve your chances of surviving what lies ahead.\n\nI only have an hour into this game, and so far, it isn\u2019t that bad. There is something about [i]Malfunction[/i] that makes me believe it has the potential to do better than other Indie videogames in terms of story, concept, and creativity, and I was intrigued at the start of playing this game. However, the reason that I only have an hour into this game is because there are stability problems and glitches that make it unplayable for me, but that does not mean it\u2019s a horrible game for [i]everyone.[/i]\n\n[i]\u201cPros and Cons are specific to the game in-review alone and may not entirely include general characteristics.\u201d[/i]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]Pros[/h1][/th]\n[th][h1]Cons[/h1][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]-Unique gameplay style with two-character swapping.[/td]\n[td]-Controls are not easily manageable as it appears on-screen.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]-Decent pixel-graphics.[/td]\n[td]-Saves and autosaves in-game do not work properly, especially when you died or failed an objective.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]-Decent storyline, interesting concept.[/td]\n[td]-Maps and environments for each level are inadequately designed, confusing player-pathing.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]-Unique crafting system that seasons the game with a little more flavor.[/td]\n[td]-UI is a bit buggy, often broken.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]-Catchy music [i]at the beginning of the game[/i], good environmental audio and effects.[/td]\n[td]-Music seems to fade in and out, or disappear entirely from the game after two levels in.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]-Achievements are available.[/td]\n[td]-Some craftable items in-game do not really serve a purpose, or are simply there for show.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]-If updated, fixed, and improved, this game has the potential to be great.[/td]\n[td]-Character leveling is a mechanic, but not deeply-integrated, such that the player has no idea what benefits come from it.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]N/A[/td]\n[td]-Very, very easy to get stuck somewhere in the game that you can\u2019t get out, and reloading the save does not necessarily fix this issue.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]N/A[/td]\n[td]-All levels and chapters are unlocked, which makes playing the game from start to finish less exhilarating.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[i]\u201cGrading is based on Pros and Cons, and is specific to the overall status and condition of the game in-review.\u201d[/i]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]Subject[/h1][/th]\n[th][h1]Grade[/h1][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Story[/td]\n[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n[td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Graphics[/td]\n[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Music and Audio[/td]\n[td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Visualization[/td]\n[td]C-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]NPC Coding[/td]\n[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Stability[/td]\n[td]D+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]UI/HUD/SP[/td]\n[td]C-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Price-to-Game Worth[/td]\n[td]A-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1][b]\ud83d\udc2fSnowy\u2019s Scorey\ud83d\udc2f[/b][/h1]\n7.1/10\n\n[h1][i][b]Personal Thoughts?[/b][/i][/h1]\n[i]Malfunction[/i] is a game that is worth its price. I can play and complete this game in maybe less than the time indicated on the Store Page, but regardless of how fast it can be completed, it [i]does[/i] have content, and it functions well. \n\nHowever, given the issues listed above, my only concern with the game is that saves are broken, the maps are not designed to give players proper pathing, and the UI overall is definitely a classic, old-computer style system, but that is ruined the fact that it is somewhat broken.\n\nDespite all the Cons, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a different taste from today\u2019s videogaming cravings. In addition to that, as said before, this game [i]does[/i] have potential, so long as the developer(s) improve(s) their game.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501743843, "timestamp_created": 1501724936, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079350603", "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 141, "last_played": 1501723052, "playtime_forever": 75}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
