[spoiler]it doesn't[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n\nCelestial Creator's premise is primarily to act as a form of construction based game where you're placed in a world with over 300 materials at your disposal to create what you want. The game also has a number of asteroid belts that you can toggle that can come and destroy builds that you've made and as an extra challenge, the player can protect the builds they've made with the protector build of the main character. On the topic of character builds, there are different types of character builds that can be toggled with the numerical keys, there is protector mode, explorer mode, fly mode, buggy mode and big buggy mode. Protector mode as described before is used if you toggle the asteroid attacks, you're given a gun and you have to shoot them before they come into contact with anything. Explorer mode is basically a build of the character where you can run around the map and basically do nothing. There is additionally contruction mode which is the build in which you can place down different material blocks. The other modes are self explanatory in which you're given the applicable vehicle and you get to drive that around the map.\n\nOne big huge flaw of a construction based game is when you're extremely limited in the ways that you can actually construct something, and this is where Celestial Creator mostly falls flat. Now, like I said, there are over 300 materials at your disposal, but here's the thing, if you try and place a material ontop of something else, it will simply mirror the material that you placed it ontop of, regardless of what material you're holding. For example, if you want to place a stone block ontop of a grass block, you can't, instead when you try to place the block down, all you will end up with is a grass block ontop of a grass block. As you can imagine, with this being apparent, the game becomes extremely limited in what it is that you can construct. As a result of you basically being unable to construct much towards your desires (unless you like creating towers of grass blocks) you can't really construct much, taking a lot of the possible fun out of the protector mode as well, since there is not much of a risk as a result of any failures you may have.\n\nAs for the vehicle modes, they're incredibly glitchy, especially the jeeps as there is a good 80% chance that when you hit certain speed limits on the vehicles, the vehicle will glitch out and throw you off the map and will cause a reload behind a really long load screen (and yes, all load screens in this game are very long.)\n\nAdditionally, something else that I want to bring up is the control scheme in the game, as this was probably the best part of the whole game, and you might be thinking how can a control scheme be the stand out feature of the game? When the control scheme makes no sense at all and the sheer inexperience with the control scheme actually makes you laugh with confusion as to why someone would think this was a good control scheme. Here are a few stand out hotkeys that the game has to perform certain actions:\n\n[list]\n[*]To initiate the asteroid waves, the player has to press \"page up\" to go to the next wave and \"page down\" to go to the previous wave.\n[*]When in protector mode, the player has to hold down \"Alt\" to run instead of \"Shift\"\n[*]To actually change the settings in the game, such as the quality of the game to get a better performance, you have to click \"=\"\n[*]To actually see the control scheme in it's entirety, and by that I mean to understand how to really perform any actions in the game at all, you have to press \"\\\"\n[/list]\n\nThis game has no real redeemable qualities, and is definitely not worth the \u00a310 base price.\n\nFinal verdict: 1/10\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews]My Steam curator group[/url]", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "12", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501065674, "timestamp_created": 1501023193, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198018006511", "num_reviews": 47, "num_games_owned": 1011, "last_played": 1501021017, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 34, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
