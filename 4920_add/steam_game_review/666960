After you find yourself stranded in a Strange world with a deep-blue Ocean and a castle with seemingly no way to escape you feel the pull towards a portal. You manage to overcome the traps and hurdles thrown at you, and clear the first portal. You find yourself in another world and ask yourself if this is just the beginning or already the end. There is nothing else to do for you other than continue, there is nothing else in the world anymore and you find the thrill, pain and challenge of the portals more satisfying than waiting for the never coming end.\n\n[Controls]\nI really admire the choice of the Developer to keep the Controls simple, you may Jump Spring and choose the direction in which to move. Simple. Perfect.\n\n[Visuals]\nUnfortunatly i have to say that there is room for improvement for the visuals.\nI do understand in the business there are hard time-limits and the stress can be overbearing.\nBUT i completly support the decision to invest the End-stage Development Time into the Gameplay so you can release a game that the players enjoy PLAYING and not LOOKING at.\n\n[Music]\nGenerally, im happy with the decisions made, implementing the Music into the gameplay of the game.\nInstead of using single songs the Developers decided to Use one Soundfile that gets Looped over and over again.\nThe Soundfile is 30 Minutes and 28 seconds long and gives the player enough repetition to feel as uncomfortable as a Cowboy trapped in the Underworld.\nAll in all the perfect Music to underline the general concept of the game.\n\nYou can find the Music in your Steam library under Music>Album>Music.\n\n[Level Designs]\n\nThere are 14 Game Worlds which range from castles flooded with rapid currents, heated lava levels inside a volcano to throat tightening stuctures that suck the air out of your lungs.\nI found the Difficulty levels adequat altough i found the hard levels to be too easy relative to the easy levels.\n\n[Summary]\n\nI would give this game a 7/10.\nI appreciate the games existance and hope it helps the Western Deathrun Genre to turn into the right direction.\nGood for casual gaming evenings and keeping away your suicidal tendencies.\n\n\n", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501371924, "timestamp_created": 1501371924, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060757895", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 358, "last_played": 1501438432, "playtime_forever": 437}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33675357", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461317", "review": "Cowboy's Adventure is a masterpiece of a game.
