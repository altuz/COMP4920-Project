For example, this game is clumsy with the controls and physics. The wolves take a huge amount of bullets to die and the hit box is very strange when they are moving. The map is small, uninterested and the cabins are almost non-existent. They are really better options out there, so save your time and money and don't look at this.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504980149, "timestamp_created": 1504980149, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198143211411", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 57, "last_played": 1504979822, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
