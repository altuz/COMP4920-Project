During most of the gameplay, there is no music which made a bad first impression. However, you do need to listen to sound effects to avoid certain enemies so it makes sense. There are a couple things that could be improved like oversized text boxes but for $1 I can forgive it.\n\n[b] Few technical notes [/b]\n\nI am having some trouble starting and exiting the game properly. Basically, at the moment I have to start the game from the folder. If I exit it keeps on running. There are several checkpoints but there are no save files so you have to beat the game in one set. The game is about 1-2 hours long so it is not a huge problem. (as far as I can tell there might be 2 endings) You can play with a controller but I don't think you can remap any buttons. The text boxes are a bit of a problem because they hide enemies that you have to jump over. \n\nMovement is a little stiff but I don't mind it because it feels like some of the older games that I like. You will have to do a jump+kick to reach some of the platforms which are tricky. \n\n[b] Gameplay [/b] - I should note that you will probably enjoy the game more if you do not read the rest of the review. \n\nThe game has a Night/Day cycle that changes certain things. One of the puzzles, for example, could only be done during the night. Some of the house features change after each day. During the night you can do puzzles but you gonna get chased by all kinds of enemies. Most monsters have a different mechanic, some slow you, some scare you and other just murder the crap out of you. You can speed up the Night cycle by lighting candles so the main goal is usually to survive the night and get next checkpoint. Puzzles were very straight forward so there is not much in terms of thinking or detective work. \n\nHouse has 3 floors and few locked rooms. Not a lot in terms of exploration but again the game was only $1. \n\n[b] Animation/Music/Atmosphere [/b]\n\nGoing back to my earlier point this game does not use a lot of music. I probably could argue that few areas would have benefited from having a theme (even like the first 5 minutes where you just explore the house) Since you do need to listen to sound effects to avoid few enemies I can let it slide. When the game does use music it is enjoyable though. Animations and backgrounds were appealing to me. There are a couple ways to die and I really enjoyed doing so.\n\nI did actually find the game kinda creepy even though I played during the day. It does not create much suspense though. Few areas around the house have unique events that may startle you. Pixel game can only be so scary but in retrospect, I should have played it at night. Like there is this one enemy that always spooks me because it can come out of nowhere with loud sound effect. Jump scares were not always earned but the atmosphere was alright.\n\n[h1] Rating 6/10 [/h1] Easy 7/10 for me if text size and starting issues are fixed.\n\nI think the concept of solving puzzles while you have to cycle between night/day is kinda neat. They should have capitalized more on the format of the game. If you want a short horror platformer I think it exceeds $1 expectations.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501521186, "timestamp_created": 1500661875, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "last_played": 1500870572, "playtime_forever": 349}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33850118", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501785", "review": "Long story short, the premise of surviving in a house in the middle of nowhere that is haunted in a nasty fashion is intriguing. The price, pixel art and controls are good. But the game offers little in actual content and just gets boring quick. No real fright moments, just rejects from The Real Ghostbusters as enemies and some awful issues with the text both taking up a ton of space and fading slowly, no saving feature and a lack of incentive to explore.
