I'll have to split this review into sections.\n\nI'm glad I bought this game with a 90% off voucher (Making it 8 pence, which is about as much as it's worth). \n\n[h1]  The Game [/h1]\nThe graphics are pretty shoddy and the controls are... also shoddy. You need to shoot presents far higher than you think you will need to, and I'm not sure why you can move a tiny bit up the pole if you can't move up and down freely along the whole thing?\n\nYou have one life throughout the whole game. Given that this is a game where the slightest wrong movement causes insta-death, this is not practical, and that even having three lives only would still be a tough challenge. \nLeading on from this- there are too many elements to keep track of in this game in order to not die. You have a timer counting down to your death, which can only be replenished through shooting presents onto the window sills. You also have various enemies/cats attacking you, draining your health bar, which can only be replenished from random drops (that you might not even be able to pick up if they get dropped at all). You also have these random poles sticking out from your climbing space. Hitting even one of these will cause instant game over, whether or not it was in order to avoid an enemy attack or shoot a present into a window. These poles will also prevent your presents from flying properly.\n\n[h1] Other notable problems?\t[/h1]\n\nThe achivements in this game are not what they seem. Upon viewing the global achievement stats before purchase it would seem that all achievements were relatively easy to attain, with 33(ish) percent of people having played, having 100% of the achievements. This was actually what made me decide to buy the game, 8p or no 8p- another nice 100% to add to the shelf is always appreciated. However, I cannot believe that these figures are correct. The game is incredibly difficult due to only having one life, and after an hour I have not even faced the second boss (though I have come close), and I can't imagine that 33% of players have completed all the way past level 5. Something with those stats is not right.\n\nLastly, a note about trading cards as promised in the steam store page? Yeah, I thought at the very least I'd get the cards to make back my lousy 8p from this shambles of a game, however, the trading cards are not active and after a statement from the creator back in July (which was vague and hard to read, to say the least), I  dont know when/if they will ever be available, so don't count on that.\n\n___\n\nAll in all, pretty poor results for this game. It should be free, and even then I would caution people against purchasing.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505598243, "timestamp_created": 1505598153, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198096067158", "num_reviews": 24, "num_games_owned": 129, "last_played": 1505679978, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34802141", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500070", "review": "Ce jeu a 10 centimes vaut le coup pour y jouer , il a de simples m\u00e9canisme de jeu et de simple graphisme mais agr\u00e9able aux yeux , ce jeu ce rend particuli\u00e8rement addicitif du fait que l'on voit ou nous nous situons au niveau mondiale du score et cela nous donne envies de le d\u00e9passer \n\nJe recommande ce jeu a 1 euro mais si vous avez un bon d'achat comme moi prenez le :-)", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504816350, "timestamp_created": 1504816350, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198102886125", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 81, "last_played": 1504816076, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
