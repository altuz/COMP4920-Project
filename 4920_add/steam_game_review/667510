I just loaded the game up and there was no game available in the load game slot :| To the dev, you may wanna make it WAY more clear when/how the game saves. I died and it kicked me back to the start of the room I was in, so I assumed it was 'saved' in some way, since there was no \"this is a save point\" or anything like that and Alt-F4'd, which I guess totally didn't save anything at all. :( The little heart-thing in town, which spins and boops when you hit it, apparently also isn't a save point? Kind've an annoying thing to have be so unnecessarily unclear. \n\nUpon booting it back up I see in the start/escape menu there's a \"Save and quit\" while playing - a simple \"Be sure you save and quit from the menu!\" warning would help alleviate that. It does seem to 'autosave' in that if you die or something you get pushed back a bit, and I guess the spinning heart in town is maybe a heal or something and not a save?\n\nAlso, having to constantly hold a button to sprint gets tiresome, there's almost no times I find myself not wanting to be sprinting, and it's kinda annoying to have to mash a button constantly to avoid going at a crawl.\n\nA pretty cute little game from what I've seen so far. It popped up the other day and I kept an eye on it for reviews and such and figured since nobody else had and it wasn't very expensive I'd take a shot at it.\n\nFirst and foremost, it plays/runs smoothly. I wasn't fighting with any technical issues, lag, controller/mouse/keyboard fiddling or anything - it loaded up full screen, ran fine, etc. right from the get go, so I quite appreciate that.\n\nThe UI and text and everything feels appropriate for the games art style - there's not a jarring variation in he aesthetic, fonts, or anything else.\n\nThe music is a little bland in some of the first couple areas and repeats pretty readily, but I get the impression this was a game made by a fairly small team, so I can give a pass there, especially as it wasn't extremely bothersom or anything.\n\nYou can think of it kina like the SNES Zelda and it's ilk, but with more of a variety of weapons and items as the selling point. There's a bit of story and all, but any 'serious' feel to it is thrown off by the NPCs who mostly just kinda say kinda wacky or silly things - the writing isn't bad, but it's probably not the game's strongest suit.\n\nIf you are looking for a top-down game where you run from screen to screen killing enemies and finding items with a range of effects/ranges/stats, a bunch of crafting/gathering materials and blueprints to upgrade/make your weapons, all while having a pretty classic SNES-esque \"find the things to put in the place\" storyline of sorts, then this is a solid little indie title.\n\nMy biggest complaint is a personal preference, but I can't stand heavily gradient/rendered lighting effects on pixel art, it just drives me up the wall, but most people seem to not really care, so whatever on that one I suppose.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501375260, "timestamp_created": 1501374796, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197967981251", "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 380, "last_played": 1505729698, "playtime_forever": 498}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
