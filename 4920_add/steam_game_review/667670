Every player, whether they are skilled at bullet hells or not, can enjoy this game due to its various difficulty settings.  Oh, and just as a side comment: the 30-second survival bonus levels are absolutely insane (in a fun way), EVEN if you're only playing in normal mode!\n\nPerhaps the most satisfying feature of this game is the ability to select your weapons, engine abilities, and other special abilities for your ship; the game gives you many options and a variety of abilities and weapons right away.  That means no leveling up required, no \"grinding for credits to upgrade your ship\" necessary (from what I have observed so far).\n\nThere is not much to complain about this game.  Think about this: you can adjust the difficulty to the difficulty you can handle, you have a variety of game modes to choose from, you won't (shouldn't) die in one hit from a bullet.  However, if there was one thing that I had to point out, it would have to be the weapons.  Since I am playing solo, I felt as if the weapons were not powerful enough at times to take out an entire cluster of enemies before they swarmed me and blasted bullets in my face.  However, it might just be because this game is really meant to be played with multiple people.\n\nOverall, Expanse is a great bullet hell that won't probably frustrate you.  Your eight dollars will be worth it.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503709714, "timestamp_created": 1503709714, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198055978063", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 34, "last_played": 1504999504, "playtime_forever": 230}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
