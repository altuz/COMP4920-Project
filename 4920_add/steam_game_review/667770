It\u2019s a puzzle room mystery game, but there are several rooms to unlock and explore.\n\nI was impressed with the overall design of the game. It\u2019s an environment that I enjoy spending lots of time in. The home your exploring feels like a historic victorian home, but it\u2019s riddled with advanced futuristic technology. \n\nThe thing I liked most about the game was the frequent use of Puzzle Boxes. I found those really fun. If you\u2019ve ever played The Room game on iOS then you\u2019ll feel right at home here. The puzzle boxes are a satisfying experience that feel truly physical and tactile. More content is planned for this game and I hope there will be more puzzle boxes in the future.\n\nThe gameplay is quite customizable. You can choose to use the grip buttons or trigger for grabbing objects, and you can choose teleportation movement if your room scale isn\u2019t big enough. Among other options.\n\nI got about 2 hours of gameplay out of this. And this is one of those games that I\u2019ll be replaying down the road after I\u2019ve forgotten it. I feel that I\u2019ve gotten my moneys worth. For puzzle fans, I recommend it.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505305559, "timestamp_created": 1505305559, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198096412999", "num_reviews": 86, "num_games_owned": 169, "last_played": 1505006347, "playtime_forever": 157}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
