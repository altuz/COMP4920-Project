It also is very polished (unlike Town of Salem... >_> ), and the developers are working hard on bringing more content to the game, including a voice chat system. They also are very open to feedback and suggestions, and active in their community.\n\nThe biggest weakness of this game is that, of course, being an online game, it needs a lively online community. However, unfortunately for Mindnight, the community for this game is very small. You can't really just jump into the game and play, but have to coordinate with other players of the game on the Discord server in order to set up even 5 (let alone 8!) players.\n\nDespite that big issue, I do recommend getting this game. Mindnight deserves a healthy community to play this game. It really does. And perhaps if more people are willing to give it a shot, we will be able to get a proper community playing this intriguing game.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505225009, "timestamp_created": 1505225009, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017862899", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 1705, "last_played": 1505501876, "playtime_forever": 278}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34846136", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "This is \"The resistance\" board game in Videogame.
