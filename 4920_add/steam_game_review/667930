The way that the developers make dodgeball fun and entertaining to play continously is awesome! I love their new updates like how the ball turns to glass after being on the ground for a while and also the new added game modes like Last Life, Insane mode, time mode and the other ones they added. And this game only costs $2 so you should buy it! Definitely recommended! Very little bugs but the improvements do not affect game play.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506751251, "timestamp_created": 1506751251, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "steamid": "76561198300635499", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 3, "last_played": 1506751098, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
