Landing in vertical mode takes a ton of practice, be patient, it is worth it. \n\nAnd for the love of Spock, sit your butt in a chair before you fly the first time. When I first got airborne I got a little dizzy, mainly because I didnt do the tutorials before my first flight and takeoff was a bit rough, but the motion takes some getting used to. \n\nThe graphics are ok on this game, but the mechanics and the interaction in the cockpit are fantastic. The one major improvement I could see is actual joystick support although that would get tricky since you need both motion controllers to flip switches and interact with the control panels.\n\nOverall I give this a solid 6/10 for what it is right now, however, this game has the potential to be astounding.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506050303, "timestamp_created": 1506050303, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198050796114", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 233, "last_played": 1505348282, "playtime_forever": 149}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35221219", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "This is the closest I will ever get to flying a real aircraft.\n\nTL;DR Holy Bajeesus, this game is amazing.\n\nFirstly, the cons.\n\n* Only one area to fly in\n* Tutorial is unfinished\n* Can only start on carrer in free mode\n* Very difficult for players who have never done any kind of flight simulation.\n* As of now, only one aircraft choice, but there is another in the works\n* No checkpoints in missions. You die, you start from beginning. They are usually fairly short missions, but this can get irritating.\n\nHowever, I anticipate all these problems to be solved by release.\n\nThe actual simulation aspect is heavily simplified, this is to keep it accessible for all players, not just simulation enthusiasts. This is a good thing even if you are a regular flight sim player, as if you end up getting shot down, you don't really want to go through a 30min pre flight procedure every time you die. There are still plenty of buttons to play around with however, so it doesn't feel too arcadey.\n\nThe aircraft handles exactly how I would imagine it would, and it is very easy to keep control as long as you make deliberate movements, even with flight assist off. It is a lot of fun to switch between conventional and VTOL flight in the middle of combat situations.\n\nSpeaking of which, combat is realistic. You dont have a health pool that drains into a game over, one missile hit and you are down. Gun damage seems to be a little weak against you, but I have not really stuck around in the middle of gunfire to see how long it takes to take you down. Your weapons are very powerful, and typically take down targets with no issue. It seems a little difficult to shake off missiles, even when deploying countermeasures, but I am not a combat pilot IRL, and there is no missile evasion tutorial yet so it is probably me doing something wrong.\n\nWhile the campaign and Free flight modes are a lot of fun, I would hope to see some generated dynamic missions that can play out for a number of rearms for replayability value.\n\nWhile flying around, especially on longer flights it does get a bit dull. There is a built in MP3 player in the aircraft, because why not, but some ambient radio would be nice.\n\nI expect to play a lot more of this, especially as it is still in development with regular new content.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506430221, "timestamp_created": 1506430221, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 570, "steamid": "76561198000408499", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 213, "last_played": 1506466736, "playtime_forever": 570}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35450048", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "When I saw the price (32 $), I told myself that I was going to try it and reimburse (95% chance) if I don't like it.\n\nF**K, i'm keeping it.
