It's the fourth entry in a series of Flash games on the internet called The Fancy Pants Adventures.\nTLDR; I really loved the game but it felt to me more like an early access title than a full-fledged title.\n\nPros:\n- Extremely smooth platforming! I mean it.\n- The combat system is pretty good, with Fancy Pants man being able to stomp and slide through enemies with his own platforming abilities before finishing them off with a selection of his pencil attacks.\n- The customisation is great, with the player being able to choose a multitude of pants and hats to wear\n- Throughout the game the player recieves upgrades to his pencil, first upgrading it to a fountain pen, then to the ability to use new attacks like dashing, spinning around like a buzz saw, and shooting ink from it like a machine gun among others.\n- The art style is very unique. It may looks bland, but it fits in with the whole theme of the game being set in a cartoon world.\n- The bosses require thinking in order to defeat them, unlike just running around slicing at their faces.\n- There are a ton of challenges in the game that start out relatively simple, but near the end get HARD. Not just from the amount of enemies, but in the changes in direction and speed you need to make, sometimes in mid air, and the reflexes you need. They are also pretty hard to find and get to, meaning you need to explore every part of the world and leave no stone unturned!\n- Great music that never gets boring! I especially liked the music in Squiggleville Plains.\n\nCons:\n- Short. Like really, really short. The game is about 1-2 hours long, and some of the levels are about an entire screen long. Plus, at the end of the final boss fight, (SPOILER ALERT), you're given a \"To be continued...\" with not even anything to answer why you've been fighting those ink blob thingos the whole time. I'm hoping that the developer Brad Borne is going to add the rest of the story in a future update and not post it as another game.\n- The enemy design cuts back to ink blobs about 30 minutes into the game and that's how it stays. There's no explanation on what happened to the spiders and ninjas you've been fighting for the past few levels, and the ink blobs can't be stomped on or slided into, which turns the mid-air parkour fighting style you've been doing into a simple game of spam the attack button.\n- The game doesn't tell you what to do at the start of the game (In case your wondering the controls are arrow keys and A and S to jump and attack respectively.) I only knew that because I played the original games on the developer's website.\n- There isn't a menu. Every time you start the game it launches straight in. It's not really a con but I was a tad bit annoyed that you can't select level from a menu or choose to restart the level like in earlier games. About 3/4 in you get a map to go through earlier worlds, but it's not the same since you can't choose the exact place and find the challenge rooms you missed easily, although the map does tell you in which world you missed them.\n- When you change colour/pattern of your pants, the colour and pattern of the health bar will change too. I noticed that after you upgrade your health, if you're wearing certain styles of pants the patterns will stop at certain points of your health, leaving just a white portion of your health bar against how much damage you've taken.\n\nOverall though, I enjoyed the game but I think that it feels like an early access game since there's no ending to it, and things like a menu and a tutorial are missing from it. Hopefully these will be changed in future updates but for now, I'd give this game about 8/10.\nIf no updates come and a few years from now Ultra Fancy Pants Adventure comes out I'm going to be mad though...", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506235508, "timestamp_created": 1506235314, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 373, "steamid": "76561198259988601", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 27, "last_played": 1507083332, "playtime_forever": 373}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35094345", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523180", "review": "[h1] Amazing platformer that gives you absolute freedom of movement.[/h1] \n\n[b] Loved this game series ever since world 1 (especially that sick ass theme to The Fancy Pants Adventures), and I am glad to see this game finally come to steam in an all new installment.

It was my first ever flash game and I thought the game was perfect back in the day. Great controls, great music and great level design. Then \"World 2\" came out and it was a huge improvement over the original. Even better controls, more levels, and an actual story (well kinda). After that \"World 3\" came out and it was even bigger and better than \"World 2\". A real storyline, better level aesthetics, a brand new weapon (pencil), new challenge rooms. Overall the original trilogy was perfect and if you want to know what's the best way to experience it, go buy \"Fancy Pants Adventure\", it has Remixed \"World 1\", \"World 2\" and \"World 3\", more levels, over 130+ customizations and more modes. So why am I saying all this? Because after 5 year long hiatus we finally got \"World 4\" and sadly, \"World 4\" or \"Super Fancy Pants Adventure\" is just ok. It's not great, it's not bad, it's just okay... \n\n\nPro's:\n\n\n- The controls are better than ever. they're much smoother and much more refined than in the previous games.\n\n\n- New gimmicks like ink riding, grinding, ink shooting are actually really fun.\n\n\n- New challenges are great. They're fast, they test your reflexes and most importantly - they're not boring.\n\n\nCon's:\n\n\n- The game is really really short. Like I beated it in 1.2 hours, how is it even possible that \"World 4\" is shorter than \"World 3\"? What did Brad say in the description of the game -- \"So many levels! - 56 brand new levels of parkour platforming\". More like 6 levels of platforming and 56 screen transitions. I think that is what he meant.\n\n\n- Do you remember all the old enemies like spiders, mices and bats? Well say goodbye to them because they only appear for one level, after that we're introduced to the new enemies - \"Ink monsters\". You can no longer slide or jump at them since you'll get hurt now. Instead the only way you can kill them is with the new weapon - the pen (which permanently replaces the old pencil). Which means you have to always stop just to destroy them and clear the path which is slow and tedious.\n\n\n- Where are the level themes? Back in previous games you had underground lair, islands, forests, pirate ship. In \"World 4\", you have only 2 level themes, and it's pirate forest and a volcano. Everything else is just a bunch of colorful platforms and blocks, like in some places it looks even more bland than \"World 1\". Brad also added the new layer mechanic in which you'll be jumping from one layer to another using springs and portals which sounds cool and it is. BUT sometimes (and sometimes means 90% of the time) the layers are either poorly rendered, created in a really low resolution, or have intense artifacting which makes them look really ugly.\n\n\n- The soundtrack is ok. In some moments it sounded good while in other cases it sounded like something you would hear in college ads. Also, no returning music except the pirate ship theme, but really who cares?\n\n\n- Where's the content, no really where is it? \"20+ items\"? \"Fancy Pants Adventure\" had 130+ items. Only hats and pants, but where are all the patterns for pants from \"World 1 Remix\"? Where is the weapon customization? Where's the skateboard gimmick? Where's the day/night mechanic? Where's is the remixed \"World 1\", \"World 2\" and \"World 3\"? Where's the multiplayer, \"Fancy Box\", the level editor, the hub-world like every single \"Fancy Pants\" game, the racing mini-game, the \"Smash Bros\" - like mode? Where is it?!\n\n\n\nIn the end, \"Super Fancy Pants Adventure\" is a good platformer, but not a good \"Fancy Pants\" game. I suggest you either wait for a pricedrop, or wait until Brad will add more content to it, and I sure hope he will, because this game has a lot of potential.", "votes_down": 13, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506684215, "timestamp_created": 1506352448, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "steamid": "76561198316177766", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 88, "last_played": 1506261237, "playtime_forever": 86}, "votes_up": 23, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35218771", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515140", "review": "I used to play this series on Newgrounds back in the day.

Let's talk about the things the game advertises on the store page.\n\n-So many levels! - 56 brand new levels of parkour platforming\n\nthere is a total of about 8 \"worlds\" and each of them is divided up into like 6 rooms. none of the art really changes throughout the worlds and they are super short. to me it felt like there was 8 levels. its like they took every single time you got a checkpoint and called it a level. some of the \"levels\" literally fit on one screen.\n\n-Collections! - Over 20 pants and hats to collect in brand new challenge stages\n\nthe last game let you collect Hat's, Pants, and swords. and there were 141 total items iirc. \"Over 20!\" wow that is really underwhelming. I didn't really feel incentivised to even collect them. I did a few challenge stages and then just avoided them the rest of the game.\n\n-Incredible Hand-drawn Style - Frame-by-frame animated worlds, enemies, and friends\n\nthe animations for fancy pants man were pretty good however the general enviorment art was inceridbly lazy. Every level is just one or two colors (watch the trailer again) with plenty of reused assets over and over again. the main enemy was a blob which i feel was only picked because its so damn easy to animate. and also they stripped down some of fancy pants moves which i feel could have just been to do less animating. it's sad that \"hand drawn\" is becoming an excuse for just not doing that much.\n\n-Hack-and-slash - Wield your mighty ink pen to take down new threats!\n\nnot much to say here. the combat was really bland you just tap attack over and over. even the boss fights were super bland you just press attack at a different time then usual. however i will say the xbox game also had this issue. it tends to just be easier to skip enimes throughout the whole game since you can literally jump over anyone.\n\n-New Moves! - Take control of Fancy Pants man with brand new combos and moves\n\nso yeah there is this upgrade shop and you can buy 3 different sword moves one of which was just a default in the last game. they are completley uneccacary and i actually beat the game before i was able to afford any of them. they don't help they are just to give a false sense of progression it feels.\n\nSecret Challenge Stages - Scattered throughout the world are secret doors to incredibly challenging bonus stages, awarding awesome prizes\n\nlike i mentioned earlier these just have pants in them. i started avoidnig them pretty quickly they weren't fun.\n\n-60fps gameplay - Perfectly smooth running for a perfectly smooth platformer\n\nnice\n\nOther miscallaneous issues\n-overall just bad platforming. sometimes the camera couldnt keep up very well causing you to jump off a cliff. lots of poorly telegraphed jumps or platforms that would move unexpectedly. the same color platform could move up or left and it cause a lot of dumb deaths. there is one room where you are going bottom to top and if you mess up you just fall lto the bottom instead of dying really annoying. lots of stuff like that plus a few bad hitboxes on walls causing you to miss easy jumps.\n\n-they completley ruined walljumping. you no longer choose what direction you jump off the wall. the tutorial says they did it because it is \"easier\" but it just gives you less control over the character and makes cheap deaths. how is it easier to not let me control where i go. this game doesnt let a good player be good.\n\n-no multiplayer ;/\n\nLiterally the game is just worse then the old one that you can play for free online except for this one is 10 dollars. if we are comparing them this one has 60 fps and controller support. the online one has actual levels with actual art, 141 items, more then 10 lines of dialouge, and a ton more.\n\ni mean where is all the charm?? the old games had all those little jokes in the background and tons of things to do in every level. the old house has the litrtle animated celine fan and fish and pictures and stuff. this new house is literally empty. NOTHING. white walls.\n\n-Where swimming???\n\n-awkward soundtrack with really awkward transitions\n\nanyway the best way to play would be on an xbox 360 but 2nd best goes to playing the free online one. this game was underwhelming an not worth 1 dollar.", "votes_down": 29, "language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506109645, "timestamp_created": 1505942689, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198082839641", "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 207, "last_played": 1505940655, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 40, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35152084", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510339", "review": "This game is too fancy to be true.\n\nI kinda miss the wallclimb and swimming, though.

This was a complete and total surprise, and I didn't even know this game existed until literally the day it released. But boy am I not disappointed that I found out.\n\nFirst of all, an admission- I am probably biased, because I played some of the older Flash-based Fancy Pants games. That out of the way...\n\n...this game is awesome. The Fancy Pants games have always been about smooth, and incredibly intuitive platforming. And some defying of the laws of physics, but that's par for the course in platformers. You don't get a double jump, but rolling, sliding, wall jumps, and all sorts of other things are available, and are very easy to grasp... although I'd strongly recommend playing with a controller rather than a keyboard unless you change the controls a bit. The default keyboard controls are a bit awkward.\n\nNew to this game (I think) is, well, a weapon. Starts as a pencil, then you replace it with a pen to let you essentially 'inkboard' around on giant panels, which is not only a lot of fun but also massively increases the possibilities when it comes to platforming, and it's later upgraded to shoot (a little wonky but it works fine for the situations it's required for), and then to let you perform ink dashes. Altogether, it's a pretty simple-to-use weapon, but there's not many things as satisfying as performing a home run with a spider.\n\nIt IS worth noting, it'll probably take you about 2-3 hours to complete the main story, so it's a touch short, but there's a lot of challenges to complete, and all sorts of hidden stuff to find- and you can go back for it pretty easily. The boss battles are a touch basic, but the final boss is actually quite fun. Not to mention, the platforming itself is also really fun in general. Ultimately, although the game overall is a bit short, I'd still say it's worth your ten bucks.\n\nEspecially with the music and incredible art. Seriously, I wish I could see how this looks in 4K. There's a LOT of work put into this game, and it shows.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505968443, "timestamp_created": 1505968443, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "steamid": "76561198095284454", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 185, "last_played": 1505967397, "playtime_forever": 126}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35137961", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507525", "review": "This game is wonderful.

First off:\n\n1. I am a huge fan of the Fancy Pants Series\n2. I finished the game all the way to completion\n3. I hadn't played the game in a long time\n\nSuper Fancy Pants Adventires is a fun and exciting game to play, and it is something I think anyone from all ages can enjoy. The best way I can some it up is that it's a momentum platformer game, with Hack and Slash elements that build off of what was experienced at the end of Fancy Pants 3. Yes I said Fancy Pants 3, there are a lot of games out there already, and I recommend checking them out. The game isn't that long once you get the mechanics down, it's a very simple combo system, but the game adds new things throughout your playthrough that make it more interesting. There are hidden easter eggs, and challenges that allow you to collect fancy hats and pants. The challenges are designed to teach you about certain tricks when platforming, or attacking, which I think is pretty cool.\n\nI also want to say, from what I've seen of my playthrough, I don't think this is an entire game, as some parts of the map seem incomplete, or some things look like they are designed to be interacted with, but were never made to, mechanics wise, I think it's really worth it, as people can have fun for hours on end, even in a smaller area that the maps provide, as running through again, isn't boring, as once you have all the abillites, you can find new ways to make your way around the map, and sometimes find challenges you couldn't see before.\n\nTL;DR\nIt's a fun platformer, if albeit a bit short, I do think more content is going to be added at a later date though, which has got me excited for what's in store for the rest of the game. If you want to wait for more, then that's fine I totally understand that, but I do want to say that the gameplay is really worth it, even if the game isn't that long.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506208871, "timestamp_created": 1506208871, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 463, "steamid": "76561198110651094", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 73, "last_played": 1506208200, "playtime_forever": 463}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35205630", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508156", "review": "Never write reviews for games but this game is amazing.  Saw a speedrun for it and remembered all of the fun I had playing the flash version in school.  This game has all of the fast paced, fluid movement that I remember from back in the day with the addition of weapon upgrades, additional movement options, and an enjoyable (although short) storyline.  Overall the game was quite easy, but that is what I wanted out of a Super Fancy Pants game.  This isn't meant to be any sort of overused \"dark souls\" type of game where you die 48 times trying to figure out one jump.
