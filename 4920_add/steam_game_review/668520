Thoroughly enjoyed it on a mobile device, though I wasn't particular good at the game. Since it was fun I added the game to my Steam Wishlist and when it was released today, I straight away bought it.\n\nIn the game you fly a mecha robot \"on a rail\" shooting down invading aircraft. In between the flying parts of the level your robot lands on roofs or roads to combat enemies walking or flying around him. In other sections your robot drives a fast vehicle through streets. Each different combat section requires a different play style adding much variety to the level design.\n\nHaving just completed the first level, which incorperates all game play styles stated above, I have moved on to level 2 which is in the format of a traditional space shooter game. So again, a different kind of gameplay experience.\n\nThe game is fast paced, and at least for a fairly new player like me, quite difficult. I died a lot. The game is forgiving however, ending up being \"Game Over\" provides the option to restart the game at the last save point.\n\nDespite having spent limited time in the game, I had a lot of fun playing my way through the first level, and for the cheap price would definiatelly recommend it to players who like casual shooter games. Specially given the game can be played from the couch with a controller.\n\nMight update this review further after having spent some more time in the game.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502899494, "timestamp_created": 1502899494, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995334687", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 623, "last_played": 1502987096, "playtime_forever": 104}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
