HOWEVER, it is still easily understandable. Minor grammar issue and all, please stop whining about it. Yes, it could've been better, but really, if you pass on this one, you're missing out on good stuff.\n\nNow, let's get started.\n\nI bought this game instantly when I saw the artstyle, or primarily the price. I'm the kind of guy who judge books by its cover. However, we will talk about the price later.\nThe arts are solid, the background are nice and pretty, the characters drawn in the style that I fancy enough, but seriously. Why the hell are we talking about the arstyle. This is a Visual Novel, godammit.\n\nThe most important thing in a Visual Novel is the story, and yes, this game has it. It's really solid, everything is paced really nicely, keeping you on the edge of your seat because it's that interesting.\n\nI played this game late at night, left it to sleep and woke up to only continue playing this the whole day. What I found surprising is, how much they offered in a such low low price. It has a quite long story, in which by the time I'm writing this, I've only reached chapter 3. It has full voiced characters, which I find quite good. I'm no Chinese so I can't really judge much. It has branching path, and even, uploads your choice to later be accumulated and statistically presented.\n\nI feel quite bad for not paying full price, 40% discount for this already really cheap game that offered so much. Please accept my forgiveness dev team.\n\nIf you haven't grabbed this one yet, take it. It's worth your money, heck, they should've charge more. I cannot say more to what they have offered.\n\nHowever, though. I do have some criticisms as well. Probably has some spoilers, be warned.\n- Need more Daisy.\n- Better English translation pls.\n- Daisy.\n- The progression for Violet seems a bit dull, as the only thing that keeps it going is [spoiler]\"They're the same\"[/spoiler] and that's it.\n- The usage of flashbacks are quite weird too, for example that time when [spoiler]Daisy wins the competition[/spoiler]. It could've been told linearly like (cause->result->aftermath) but it was shown more like (cause->aftermath->result) -- it might make the storytelling a little bit more interesting, but meeh. it keeps being repeated.\n- Daisy.\n- The branching options also seems a bit dull\n\nAs I'm still currently playing this game, I'll take back what I said if there's something wrong in my review. Thank you devs for making this wonderful world that I will never experience in my life. Please keep making more quality content.

We've got some intriguing background flash back story and then it starts with us coming to school after summer break. Translation is good, pacing of the story, small nice jokes, fun characters.\n\nYeah I just see no reason to not promote it right away (except no resolution change). I am interested how this game will progress. I doubt that my opinion is gonna change, so I can clearly recommend Tricolour Lovestory already for it's price. After all I saw in many VN's.

So far I have only finished the first chapter, and I can't wait to see what will happen next. This game has the best character design, best plot design, best cg, and best bgm. I've only played Mandarin version, and the rhetorics and literary style in dialogues in this game (especially the monologue of the main guy and his inner world) are amzing. Though I doubt the English version can be as good as the Mandarin one because of the complexity of translation. \n\nI sincerely recommand you this game if you speak Mandarin and you like love story. It will worth much more than $1.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506151988, "timestamp_created": 1506151988, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 978, "steamid": "76561198087711178", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 107, "last_played": 1506334878, "playtime_forever": 978}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
