It plays a lot like Quake or Doom.  You advance through the corridor type levels and find the key cards to advance.  Every new room leads to more monsters.  They swarm you relentlessly.  There are a few different types of weapons.  The starting weapon is the pistol which has unlimited refills, after every 10 rounds it automatically reloads which takes a few seconds.  All the other weapons need to be refilled by ammo pick ups.\n\nYou are given a few different options for movement.  You have your standard teleportation.  Be careful, being in early access you are able to teleport through walls.  This will sometimes lead you outside the map or straight into the middle of a monster mash.  The second and third option are controlled with a button on your gun hand or empty hand.  Pressing the move button on your gun hand moves you where the gun is pointing.  Pushing the move button on your empty hand moves where that hand is pointing.  I'm playing on Touch so I really want to see an option for simple joystick movement.  It is extremely difficult to strafe as it is currently and that will be important going forward as some of the monsters shoot at you.  I can't stress this enough devs, please add joystick/trackpad movement(think pavlov or onward).  We need a tight movement system to bring out this games potential because it wants to be faster paced than I'm able to move.\n\nA few things that need fixing.  Ammo pickups are cartoonishly large.  Also it was very difficult to tell which ammo or shields I was picking up.\n\nAt the start of every level I had to teleport once to get to the proper height for my person.\n\nIf you change the movement system you can allow the free hand to be used as a second hand to hold your weapon.  It will makes the use of all weapons besides the pistol feel a lot better.  It's very strange shooting a shotgun and assault rifle with one hand.\n\nI like where this game is headed.  Adding the joystick/touchpad movement will double the appeal of this game.  I recommend picking this up if you like classic shooters and would like to help the devs get this thing polished up real nice.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502679184, "timestamp_created": 1502679184, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963773699", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 55, "last_played": 1502678403, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34343469", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "review": "I want to like this game as it looks like it was doom inspired, unfortunately the controls are way too awkward for me.

The way to control your speed while pointing, still feels a little unresponsive at times but I would like to see how that evolves.

It's always hard to comment on a game that's still in development but here's what I think of it so far:\n\nPros:\n\n- Quake/Doom like atmosphere.\n- I like the design of the enemies.\n- Shooting/Aiming is ok.\n\nCons (& possible improvements):\n\n- The sound isn't very good.\n- Movement isn't pleasant (with the Touch controllers), especially because it's very hard to go backwards.\n- Level design is quite repetitive/ Phobos sky doesn't look right.\n- Only goal is to find keycards to open doors.\n- Could use (a lot) more 'atmospheric' lighting, sounds and textures.\n\nBecause I can sympathize with the initiative of this game I'll recommend it, but don't expect a marvelous game when you download it.
