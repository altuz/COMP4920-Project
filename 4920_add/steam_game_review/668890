Otherwise\u2026\n\nGraphics are not quite as good as Turok from 1997 which I played recently and it runs worse than Turok on my machine which makes no sense as there are no animations other than a few animals (mostly stuck in walls) and no ambient sounds.  The gray rocky walls in the first area reminded me of the graphics in the original Doom.\n\nHilly Landscape map was kind of a non-event.  Then Mountain Top and I look at the mountains in the distance and think \u201cNow that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d.  Oh, wait\u2026 All you can do is LOOK at the mountain tops and the actual map is about as interesting as Hilly Landscape.  The pine grove could have been nice except for the impenetrable branches and I wound up coming out pretty much where I started.  And in one spot I rotated 360 and saw 3 of one and 2 of another identical boulders so not much variety in the landscape.\n\nOther than a few random rocks, most of which you can\u2019t climb, the terrain is almost perfectly flat.\n\nThere is pretty much nothing to explore.  Those ledges up there that might be interesting?  No way to get to them.  That crevice that looks like it might lead somewhere?  Doesn\u2019t.\n\n\"Played\" the other 4 levels and they were no better.  On Swan Lake when prompted to I chose the option to improve my performance so it reduced the graphics detail and the lake disappeared.  And increasing the graphics again did nothing and I had to quit to get the lake back.\n\nI am not sure where the line is between relaxing and boring but I am going to have to call this one boring.\n", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504583307, "timestamp_created": 1504583307, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 577, "steamid": "76561197982994722", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 2731, "last_played": 1506574641, "playtime_forever": 851}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
