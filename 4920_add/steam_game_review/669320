Well, what you expect, it is not Total War mod.\n\nThis is basically \"born outside of marriage\" child of Crusader Kings/Victoria series and chinese wet dreams.\n\nGame too much chinese in some instances, like horrible unnatural colors of map or pinyin translation of some titles (like Supreme Commander/Grand Commandant simple called Taiwei, well, at least tooltip here is good and you understand who is it even if you are not chinese history enthusiast like me), it's horrible lack polishing, especially in description (all officers is \"worthless rats\" now and kingdom description looks to be copied from some wiki or essay), but it's more feature finished than first released version of Crusader Kings 2. Probably more feature finished than current version of Crusader Kings 2.\n\nEnglish translation currently worse than my english in this review and you probably noticed quite a bit of errors here? But it's so much better than horrible translations of many other chinese games, like Tiger Knights or, god forbid, Tale of Wuxia series. It's understandable. Still, if you are purist then wait for later versions.\n\nI not played enough yet to judge AI, but I probably edit my review later anyway.\n\nThe really good thing is that game lack some artifical limitation Crusader Kings/Victoria series set to force you to waste decades of in game time to start some minor war while your army is long ready.\n\nAnd you can build Great Chinese Wall!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506254303, "timestamp_created": 1506254185, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 364, "steamid": "76561198023198529", "num_reviews": 15, "num_games_owned": 247, "last_played": 1506335505, "playtime_forever": 364}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
