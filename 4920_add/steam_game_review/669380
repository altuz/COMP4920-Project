This one keeps calling me back to it. \n\nRPGMaker scorecard\n\nCharacter Art: 7/10 There are still some assets you've seen in other games but, they aren't the same fat-jawed red-head and blue-haired-drama character panels.  \nMap Geography: 8/10 This isn't scrabbled together by an idiot or minimalized by a lazy-ass.  They put some thought into each map and dungeon. Objectives aren't quite clear all the time and you are sometimes forced to dick around til you find the place you need to go.\nEncounters: 9/10  A ton of variety, a bestiary but still not completely custom enemies.\nDialogue: 10/10  Well written.\nStory: 9/10  There's a good deal of depth but the individual motivations and some of the reactions to events aren't fleshed out. Some shit that would really change a person is just like, \"well ok..lets go about our merry way now!\"\nCombat: 7/10  Not terribly creative/ not terrible/ Characters have unique strengths.\nGrind: 6/10 Grinding makes it easier but it's not necessary.\nBugs: 9/10  Minor slowing of framerate on the worldmap occassionally\n\nSolid B grade. Granted, most RPGmaker games on steam would get an D or F. I highly recommend this game if you like RPGMaker games. Newcomers to the subgenre are lucky if they start with this one.\n\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506406829, "timestamp_created": 1506406829, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 785, "steamid": "76561198068920890", "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 421, "last_played": 1506923340, "playtime_forever": 2818}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35331412", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "A decent game worth the price.\nDespite the annoyance of random encounter, this is 90s RPG you're looking for.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506766777, "timestamp_created": 1506766777, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 495, "steamid": "76561198097125044", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 34, "last_played": 1506192516, "playtime_forever": 495}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34986743", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Having fun with it so far.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505532736, "timestamp_created": 1505532736, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030825667", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 59, "last_played": 1505532526, "playtime_forever": 160}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
