This isn't consistent, however, so non-VR mode might load properly once or even twice, but after that, you'll never see it again. \n\n- The controls are a complete mess. Nothing makes sense at all. For instance, you can't go backwards or change your elevation, you can only go forward (with \"W\") and steer with the mouse. \"D\" is apparently night vision, \"A\" lets you land on objects, but doesn't work, and \"E\" is a camera that does nothing. \n\n- There are no settings or options menu (other than choosing VR mode or non-VR mode, but that doesn't usually work either and automatically loads VR mode), so you can't change the graphics or audio at all.\n\n- The tutorial is an empty room with the controls displayed in front of you. Basically, it's the \"controls list\" of a normal game's options menu. An actual tutorial, that teaches you the basics of the game doesn't exist.\n\n- As far as I can tell, there is no way to save mid-mission, not that it really matters considering the game is practically unplayable.\n\nVERDICT: This isn't a game, it's a cruel practical joke. As a commercial product sold on Steam, it's complete garbage. The game doesn't do a single thing right.\n\nI dont care how cheap it is, it wouldn't be worth it if it were free. In fact, if Microspy weren't as cheap as it is, I'd request a refund, but for under $3 there's really no point. \n\nSo stay far away and never buy it unless you're a masochist or hate the person you're sending it to as a gift.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500803532, "timestamp_created": 1500803211, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998348465", "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 1788, "last_played": 1501991260, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33758060", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "review": "i played in on the vive. this is something fresh and interesting! 3 (short) missions in total. worth the money.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501087393, "timestamp_created": 1500867335, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970612037", "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 173, "last_played": 1500752656, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
