Animation quality is very high with just enough sceens to keep you \"interested.\" Only needs one hand to play this game Kappa.\n\nGameplay is lacking since its a point and click, I had a problem with one edge of the screen since I use two monitors. Camera movement is slow and with no keyboard support it gets hard moving from one area of the map to the next area, add that with the fact that transition area \"spot\" aren't highlighted makes the first few minutes confusing as heck, doesn't mean that they aren't they just take some time to find. The game also failed with how the hud is set up, very invasive on some parts where you needed to look at something and a chunk of it was blocked by the hud. The fact that rick-click cycles through all the things you can do is annoying as well since sometimes you wont need to use it to talk to someone but the next time you need to use the \"talk\" command gets annoying really fast.\n\nSound did what it needed to do, less then average though. No voice acting besides \"scenes.\"\n\nVisuals feel like they're from an older pc game. Models of the characters are all top notch though.\n\nNo scene selector means you have to save before a scene or just play the game all over again.\n\nOverall the game was a \"fun\" experience but a little pricy for just something that clocks in under 2 hours if you use the walkthrough.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504823947, "timestamp_created": 1504823794, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056198179", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 95, "last_played": 1504822611, "playtime_forever": 110}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34965542", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499429", "review": "It has bad controls.
