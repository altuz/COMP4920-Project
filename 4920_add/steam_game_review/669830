This is all with up to date graphics and sounds that are 'blow you awayish' and quite delightful.  \n\nOne of the difficulties of classic version is when you shoot a full sized asteroid and it blows into the smaller chunks, the explosions from this prevent you from seeing them right away.  Thus fire rapidly if you are uncertain of the locations of shrapnel!\n\nIf you're looking to play the old Asteroids but updated, then you have found it!\nLooking forward to playing the modern version of this game... will update.\n\nps. game is very well made and smooth.\n\nJust played the modern version and you get really cool guns but it is just as hard! Very challenging game!\n\nUpdate: after the update for auto fire, game is so addicting and a super fun shooter!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503103320, "timestamp_created": 1502597917, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "steamid": "76561198035248147", "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 73, "last_played": 1506819699, "playtime_forever": 2429}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34241111", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "review": "This is a great game with a good take on the classic asteroids experience.
