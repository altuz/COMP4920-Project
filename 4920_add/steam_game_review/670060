Also your Anakim has a shield that consumes energy.\n\nEventually as you progress you will obtain 3 new weapons and 2 new passives (1 weapon passive and 1 dash passive that allows you to dash around) from defeating bosses. Very megaman-esque.\n\nThere are 3 bars which are the life bar, energy bar and exp bar. Life bar is the amount of life you have while the energy bar sets a limit to how many shots you can fire your weapons. In order to recharge, you will need to stop attacking. This creates tension as you cannot fire your weapons forever.\n \nThe exp bar in this game can be built up to create charges by collecting the drops from the enemies. \nEach charge can be spent on upgrading your Anakim or activate regeneration of life or activate berserk mode. \nThis Oxus exp mechanic is disabled in the simulator for previous missions which depending on how skilled you are it might be hard to play through without the reliance of the regenerate life active ability.\n\nEventhough the Oxus exp is tied to your mech upgrades, I did reach the last mission fully upgraded with 10 charges remaining to be used in the last level so there seems to be plenty to go around with the challenges and the missions.\nCompleting challenges do help contribute to the exp bar and they are interesting to complete. The one thing that I wished was conveyed better was that on some challenges, you will find it much easier to upgrade the component being used for that challenge first before tackling the challenge. Had many frustrating moements until I upgraded the component used in the challenge.\nFor example, the dodge challenges is much easier if you upgrade the speed component of your Anakim.  \n\nThe mech also has the ability to be in multiple different modes, a map mode, scan mode, and navigation mode. \nI dislike the tank controls of the navigation mode but eventually I just got used to it. \nThe navigation mode allows you to travel faster, boost forward and lay timed bombs.\n\nThere are no re-bindable keys. \nI wish there was, as some of the controls I would have love to switch, for example the navigation mode has the boost tied to double tapping either w(forward) or right-trigger to boost. \nWould have rebind / use the option of a single button press instead of double tapping.\nNo mouse sensitivity adjustment.\n\nI started off with gamepad but eventually switched to keyboard and mouse since it was so much easier on the keyboard and mouse.\n\nThere were a few bugs that disrupted my game which have been reported to the dev and they have been responsive.\nUsing a flamethrower to defeat a boss crashes the game, one boss got stuck on re-load and forced to force quit.\nI was fortunate enough that the solutions are just don't use the flamethrower to defeat the boss and to load a previous save and try again.\n\nHopefully this will be patch out soon because it can be quite disruptive.\n\nStory:\nThis was a bit bare to me. I was not really engage with the characters but the world lore is amazing.\n\nRe-playability:\nThere are a few replayability options like an extra classic mode which is very similar to old school top-down vertical scroller shooters and very bullet hell like. Also replaying the missions again without the help of the regen and berserk charges.\n\nPros:\n- Challenging and rewarding puzzles and gameplay mechanics\n- Fun shooter combat\n- Bosses test your skills in both weapons usage, control and reflexes.\n- Interesting combination of on rail elements as well as the exploration\n\nCons:\n- Some bugs that disrupt the game flow\n- Some challenges are not optimized for gamepad controls\n- Tank controls on navigation mode. (Personal dislike)\n- No rebindable keys and mouse sensitivity adjustment\n\nI honestly recommend this game to people who enjoy twin-stick and also arcade top-down shooters.
