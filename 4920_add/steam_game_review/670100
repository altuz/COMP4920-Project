It's a pretty simple game with an easy formula.  Move right, Jump over enemies (cuz facing them head on is pointless and you can easily make it to checkpoints without dying), and fight the boss.  It's pretty easy but it is very repetitive.  The sound also glitched at one point where it sounded like it had 2 tracks playing at the same time.  And sometimes monsters won't even acknowledge your presence.  Overall, I would buy it if it was a dollar due to it's simpliticity and lack of content.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500686028, "timestamp_created": 1500686028, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198085915406", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 24, "last_played": 1500685750, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33736805", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484018", "review": "It was pretty good well worth the money...\n\na little repetitive but it was nice the artstyle was classy \n\nbut you can cheese any boss in the game so theres that \n\n\nover all great game would recomend", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500788231, "timestamp_created": 1500788231, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "steamid": "76561198292794637", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 22, "last_played": 1506139283, "playtime_forever": 102}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
