The developer was absolutely fantastic in how he chose to deal with this issue.  He listened to my concerns, explained his reasoning for why it was done that way, and then added in a quicksave feature to accomodate players like me who love retro games but don't always have the time to play through the game in one sitting.  The fact that a developer would take the time to listen to the concerns of a single customer and update the code to add in a feature is great and developers like him who take the time to address customers issues should absolutely be supported.  \n\nOther than that the game is a decently done castlevania clone.  Your character has a sword instead of a whip, and orbs instead of hearts power up your sub weapons.  The sub weapons are exaclty what you would expect, an axe that arcs, holy water that flames, an green thing that restores health, but the cross has been replaced by a ninja star and there is no stopwatch in sight.  You collect orbs by breaking torches and candles, when you break torches and candles they either drop orbs(hearts), coins(money bags), or turkey legs.  Any of this sound familiar?  \n\nThe standard sword swing is very similar to alucards in SOTN, but the crouching sword swing has this really awkward delay which makes it difficult to use and the range is less than when standing which is just weird and unneccessary.   Level design is fair and takes place initially in the countryside until you make your way into a casle and you fight enemies like bats, skeletons that throw bones, zombies, flying creatures that zig zag through the screen, giant armored knights, among other things. Each level ends with a boss fight, when the boss is defeated a red orb materializes in the center of the screen that refills your health and ends the level. Deja vu anyone?\n\nHaving said all that, I saw the trailer and wanted a castlevania clone since I am a huge fan of the series.  I got what I paid for, and if you are a fan of classic castlevania then I am sure that you will enjoy this game.

It was just ok. I didn't find it overall bad, but I probably won't revisit.\n\nThe game itself starts off pretty interesting, when the game has this ambush point and a bunch of enemies come out of the woodwork. I didn't really encounter anything else like this later. The game kinda just becomes a chore to walk through the corridors to the bosses.\n\nBosses come down to three things. They are too easy, have a pattern you discover then they are easy, which since the bosses tend to have just one, doesn't take too long, or the final, they have a randomish pattern with a ton of body damage attached. I don't like the eyeballs and if you read the story bits, the game knows they are the toughest part. Though I will say the first one was fun, due to the spike gimmick. \n\nSub weapons come off as unnecessary for the most part, being useful in some situations, but don't accomplish much otherwise. My favorite two, reason why two will be said shortly, is the Blue Orb and the Shuriken. The Shuriken it very straight forward and actually does help, being useful pretty much everywhere. I'd consider it like the Cross. The Blue Orb is great as well, showing up in chapter 3, which shoots out waves and works in a Zelda fashion, full health it works, otherwise nothing. \n\nThe issue with the Blue Orb. The game likes to have enemies every once in a while be right next to the screen change, so you enter and bam, cheap shot hit. You may run across more health, but I went for items and usually couldn't find health before the boss where the Orb could be useful. This in itself can be an issue since some changes due to how the placement of how you can view certain areas is, causes you to do leaps of faith, whether its going right/left or dropping down. Not sure why it's a thing. \n\nHit detection at times is a bit eh, but like I said earlier, most of the areas don't really provide much issue to get through, so eh.\n\nThe story is serviceable, this is the motivation, action! Does what it needs to do.\n\nI'll post a video of my first playthrough, if it looks interesting enough for you, give it a shot. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPDZVUeK7YU&feature=youtu.be", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506612135, "timestamp_created": 1506612135, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 115, "steamid": "76561197966489900", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 1259, "last_played": 1506452250, "playtime_forever": 115}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34927284", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501279", "review": "An meh Castlevania clone that takes a bit to much from it's source material to really stand out.
