The maps are filled with stairs houses that has no interaction and it is definitly not a rouge, The save button is broken so yeah i guess the dev thinks thats how it works. The monster are 4/3 diffrent types in each map, 4 maps which will take you guys about 50 mins to finish and thats it. there are no bosses no interesting story no rouge elements you get 5k from each chest and after the first 2 maps buy all the best itmes grind to the ''end''. by the way there is no end but you go to the last map with a very dissapointing nothing happens.

I am, however, apparently expected to know it well as the game more or less tells you nothing about it at the get go.  Stuff like 'your character is a high functioning undead and has known it for a long time' I find out from the store page.  (Admittedly, not a hard to find factoid.)  Does it have any impact on the game?  Not as far as I can tell.\n\nI have a laundry list of complaints from just my short time playiong.  And it shows no signs oif getting any better.  O.R. seems to have a fondness for Middle Era Finay Fantasy type games.  Buuuut the authors seem to have chosen some of the worst elements to use instead of the best.  Boring menu based coimbat.  (Really boring.  And poorly set up.  Monsters on one map always seem to have the same combat arena no matter where your party is on the map.  This isn't abnormal for this styl;e of game.  But...  The set up is poorly thought through.  For instance one maps arena has a building blocking the view of the far left monster and PC.)  Anyway... Same monsters over and over.  No real strategy involved.  Limited choices from the get go,  (Hit the monster or... um... don't hit it.  I suppose \"use an item\" or \"heal the wouned P.C.\" )  Flavor text where actual information is needed.  (10,000 GP Flame Spell Book doesn't exactly sound like a one shot item does it?)   And they seem to think the game has 'Rogue Like' elements.   What those might be I do not know.  Reviving a \"K.O.ed\" P.C. is not terrably expensive.  The maps seem to be the same every time you visit them.  There's 4 BTW.  Uh...  Oh.  The save functon seems to have been disabled.  (There's a button there, but you aren't allowed to touch it.)  The Game settings do not save either.  If you don't like the BGM you can turn it off.  Buuuut you will have to do that every time you play.  Certain menu's allow you to use the mouse while others require arrow keys to manouver.  \n\nO.R. is a mess.  I have not seen any legitimater glitches.  But I have een a LOT of poor planing and inconsistency.  This has made what might have been a fun game, one that looked cool on the store page, into one that simply isn't fun.  I highly reccomend spending your money on something else.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503671581, "timestamp_created": 1503671581, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198010134705", "num_reviews": 56, "num_games_owned": 816, "last_played": 1503670380, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 17, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34150650", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399562", "review": "how to save game\n", "votes_down": 48, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502384137, "timestamp_created": 1502384137, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198141513520", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 16, "last_played": 1502416912, "playtime_forever": 273}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
