Encountered one bug whereby one of the guys was cooking by the fire and liked it so much decided not to move again. No tutorial but clicking on the icons it all becomes self explanatory. The characters are pretty slow moving when collecting resources and so far no button to speed things along. You have to be careful at the start because my two guys died of starvation. It would be nice to see the Devs make each character \"clickable\" so you can see their current status. When clicking the characters to gather resources you have to do it individually, would be good if you could click them all at the same time. Both guys look and dress the same, as do the girls, would like to see different colored pieces of clothing to make it easier to indentify each character.\nWhen the gather resources, you have no control on what the collect, which is a shame as you're then reliant on them bringing back the resources needed to build new items.\nIt doesn't seem possible to make the characters rest when you want them to. I'd like to rest each character at will if you need to. Sleeping takes about 2-3 minutes before they all spring back to life.\nThis is early access and for the current sale price is a great buy. I'm looking forward to see what happens as I continue to play and what the Devs have in store for future updates. Would recommend!\n\nVideo link below.

Not all smooth, but in the time i've owned the game i have seen progress going in a good direction. I'd recommend it if you're into the strategy/survival thing. Things are of course likely to change due to the whole early acccess thing. Below is what i liked and disliked.\n\nYou start off with 4 characters, and each day they can do either 1, 2 or 4 actions, depending on whether you feed them that day or not, as well as what the action is. Some things, such as building or hunting, use more than 1 energy. If you have extra food then you get two extra actions, or you can play it safe and stockpile that food for a rainy day. Not that rain is int he game yet, but ya never know. \n\nBuilding stuff seems to take too long, at least for the energy spent to build compared to how long that same amount of energy takes to gather. If it takes 2 minutes of gathering for 3 out of 4 characters to end their day, but 10 minutes of building for the 4th guy to finish its a rather boring day.\n\nI like the hunting system, chance to fail, chance to succeed for several days worth of food, or chance to succeed but lose the hunting tool... great system! Also love how the guys try sneaking upon the prey.\n\nWood chopping with an axe: I'm a bit torn on this one. Its a 2 energy investment but takes several minutes to complete. Timewise i can have the other 3 people eat, each do 4 gatherings for the day and still wait on the wood guy to grab the last log or two. I'd like to see an option to assign someone to assist in log carrying, using 2 energy for the tree cutter and 1 for the assistant, but it cuts the carrying time in half (since both take 1 log at a time out of the 6 per tree). Wood gathered per tree remains the same, just grab it all faster and end the day faster.\n\nThey gathering system is nice, though i'd also like to have the random option back, with maybe a 25% chance they grab an extra item for doing random.. instead of 8 sticks maybe they bring 16 for example. As it is the hand gathering is already 1/3 as efficient as hunting or gathering with tools, so late game the women will be a lot less useful compared to the men. Perhaps even leading us to starve one out just to save on food, after all, if she isnt earning her keep...\n\nResearch for the first few items is a bit too expensive. Once you unlock tools and get the stations built gathering isnt so bad, but i kept running out of wood with the campfire burning it early on while trying to save up for the first few items.\n\nWe've been getting bug fixes frequently and new stuff implemented. The dev seems to care and be putting time into fixing and improving the game. Fun game so far, i can only see it getting better in the future.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506522191, "timestamp_created": 1506522191, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "steamid": "76561198058732998", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 318, "last_played": 1506523728, "playtime_forever": 327}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35210830", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "I had previously reported a fatal flaw in the game which the developer(s) quickly fixed.
