Seriously! I like the way this is designed and the developer has done a great job with physics here. Everything on the board has an affect on the ball. Magnets have an increased affect the closer you get to them, sand slows you down, the ball bounces off medal corners faster than it does the wood that it decorates, and the list goes on.
