I can't go by much after that.\n\nI don't really know what the controls are or how to rotate said stickman in the combats. With WSAD or my mouse? Maybe both are needed? No tutorial just right in the chaos. It comes with a single player game where you must fight your very way to the maker himself and kick his stick ass. It also has a arena mode of endless wavegame till you die nonsense.\n\nI got this for the 1000 achievements like the filthy bastard that I am, and it came with 55 broken ones.
