If you think this is just like Heat Evolution, instead of trying to persuade you into thinking it is or isn't, let me note the differences between the two...\n\n1.Stages, and Overtime\n2.Kinda Paint booth\n3.Very different Career, you have to jump into random trucks, and try and get rides.\n4.Physics, if you hit the apron you get loose, just like you would in iRacing or even in real life, but your car doesn't just immedetley whip around like in Evolution..\n5.All 3 series\n6. Completley new soundtrack, and background, which is actually pretty cool\n7. There is Split screen, and not just for console but also PC\n8. You can have Cautions again in multiplayer\n9. You can have AI fill all the empty spots in online\n10.NO RUBBERBANDING AI!!!!\n11. Rivals, if you continue to hit and crash into people in Career, they will slowly get mad at you.\n12. Momentum, if you continue to do well in Career, with a full-time ride, you can upgrade/fix parts faster, and stuff like that.\n13.The AI are improved, they don't crash in the triovals, and they usually know that you are there instead of just wrecking you.\n14. No fake drivers, all real drivers whom started Daytona\n15. Built-in DLC, almost at least 1 or 2 extra paint schemes for most drivers, not just Toyotas either.\n16. Drafting, at plate tracks, and even any other track, you can sidedraft, just draft, or bump draft, and it actually will make you and the car whom your bump drafting/drafting go faster.\n17. You can drive custom cars on online and in single player\n18. Damamge model is much more realistic, the car with have the hood caved way in, or bent all the way up. Hard to describe, but it is greatley increased.\n19. Not as twitchy when turning, the car is pretty stable, heavier, and more in control.\n20. Brakes are ten times better, your not drifting in every corner.\n21. Driver models of most real drivers\n22. Victory music, if you win a race, online or offline, a song/tune in which you can choose plays, for all too hear.\n23. Victory lane celebration, just a little scene of you, your car, and your team, and your trophy.\n\nThat's all I can think of, but there is certainly more.\n\nWhat I wish they could fix/add:\n1. Cautions, they come out better for a crash, but still if you crash by yourself, the caution usually doesn't come out...\n2. Weird REV bug, where there is a weird random loud rev in the background that gets quiet, and then loud. Just a minor bug in which they could fix.\n3. Crash physics, you still usually go flying into the air, not as bad, but you still usually get airborne, at least a little, and if you hit the wall diagloney, you spin out.\n4. AI always crashing in turns 1 and two at Texas.\n5.Private online races, like NASCAR The Game series, where you have only people that you want or invite\n6. Random bug I found, I was in a race, and all of a sudden, it said I was in posistion zero, zero miles an hour, rpms, etc. I could change stuff like the leaderboard, but.....Only happened once though..\n7.Would like victory burnouts\n8. Would like a track map, especially for all the new road courses...\n9. Would like it so you don't have to switch from leaderboard, to laps, to fuel, to damage, to water temp. NASCAR '15 had the track map, fuel gage, temperature, and a small leaderboard, all neatley on the screen.\n\nOff the top of my head, that is all I can think of. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best, I would rate this game at probably a 7.3/10. NASCAR Heat Evolution would probably be a 3.1/10, and NASCAR '15 would be a 7/10, but if they fixed the broken AI and all the stupid glitches, it would probably be a 9/10. All in all, this is a very fun, exciting, competitive, enjoyable fun NASCAR Game. I don't think that it should cost $50, I would have to say probably about $35 or so, which it will fall to $25 in a few months, so that won't matter. Not everything is the way it should be, and not everything that was complained about in NHE was fixed, but about 85% of it was, and they even added several new features and things.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506831578, "timestamp_created": 1505267101, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 524, "steamid": "76561198268545375", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 3, "last_played": 1507095398, "playtime_forever": 2544}, "votes_up": 38, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34907401", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550507", "review": "This is a huge improvement over the previous game.

It does take some time to get it how you want it as I have not quite got it set up how I need it yet.

Still plenty of room for improvement. I knew going in that this wasn't a hardcore sim. Knowing that I accept this as what it is. NH2 is a console port. I didn't bother to plug in my G29. This is a gamepad game.  Nascar in an arcade package.  I'm enjoying it for what it is. That being said, multiplayer is dead! 1 server running atm on superspeedways with 7 players and a bunch of AI cars. If you want a Nascar game that is very playable with a small learning curve here it is. If you are looking for a true Sim experience you are looking in the wrong place.  I'm giving it a positive rating because of how much better it is than last years effort. \n \n Someday maybe we'll get a Nascar title better than Nascar Racing 2003 by Papyrus. (I refuse to rent I-racing) This is not that game nor does it try to be. This is more of a true successor to the old Nascar Heat series which is what you might expect by the name.  Buy it if you are willing to accept it for the game it is.\n\nNow that I've got some time into the game. The AI are not that bad once you get them adjusted to the proper speed to be competetive with you. It takes some tweaking and time. They seem to get more agressive at the end of stages and the end of the race which is good. They don't have a good grasp on pit strategy however. I'm running a championship with 25% distance races and tried increasing to 2x tire wear and fuel consumption. The AI had no clue that they needed to pit following the stages and instead started pitting a few laps into the second stage. After stage 2 they would also stay on track resulting in a green flag stop in stage 3 unless a caution came out.  I ended up changing the fuel and tire wear back to 1x because of this. I just ran the 1st Michigan Cup series race of the season and after stage 1 I pitted and for whatever reason the free pass car was Martin Truex Jr. No idea why or how he was lapped. I decided to follow him through traffic for a few laps. He quickly worked us back into the top 20 before I turned under him on the backstretch to try for a top 10 on the stage. At the end of the stage we were 8th and 10th. which having pitted and not needing fuel put us 1 and 2 on the restart.  I took off and the pack quickly started working us over after a few laps and we fell back into the top 10. I decided to hook back up begind him and started bump drafting down the back stretch to get us back out front. We had a 2 second gap over 3rd when he dropped to pitroad. they can and will race you hard if you have them set right.  I'm hanging out 3rd in points with a couple of wins and a decent chance of making it to the final round at Homestead. I don't want it to be easy.  \n\nThe AI don't seem to suffer as badly as I do when they get aero damage,(watched helplessly as badly wrecked cars drove right by me at Daytona) that needs addressed. Also the pit strategy needs a lot of work. Cautions are not realistic at all but a major crash brings one out. Some times you'll have no idea what caused a caution. Also theres some rules that need to be implemented like the double yellow lines at Daytona and Talledega have no meaning at all other than marking the bottom of the track in the game. \n\nOver all though this game aint bad for singleplayer once you find a challenging set of options for you.  I've still not tried setting up my G-29 This is a gamepad game and that's how I'm playing it. Leave stability on an drive it with a controller and it's fine. I don't want to dominate the feild with a tweaked out setup. This game isn't made for that. It's console Nascar racing with a reasonable challenge.

Ten years later, hungry for a racing game of this kind I thought I would give this one a try. Now being developed by different developers I was a little taken back by what Heat 2 lacked. Now I never played Heat Evolution but I know enough that it was a bad game. Now Heat 2 isn\u2019t a bad game unlike its predecessor, far from it. It\u2019s pretty good but not fantastic and nothing like what came before during the time of EA version of NASCAR games. Still the graphics are pretty awesome on PC and I love the core gameplay itself.\n\nBut why is the game lacking so many basic things. Why can\u2019t I look back? Why do I have to press Y or triangle every race to get the behind view HUD to appear? Why did my game crash just as I had only three laps left? How did I survive that pile-up? Now this game does have its issues but it is starting to grow on me. It tries to add depth towards its career mode by having rivals, tweets and video messages from other drivers on the field. You can now earn your way through the different series and it feels just like the previous games in the past which feels good! You can even customise a base car already given to you from any of the three series and use it in career mode once you\u2019ve got a contract from one of the teams.\n\nBut I can\u2019t recommended this game, at least not until a sale. This game has too many issues and I hope a patch can fix most of them. If the issues are fixed I will change this review to a recommend. But I feel it will take a few more attempts before they get the perfect formulae right. Monster Games have worked hard and there is care put into this game but I have a feeling using a different engine (Unreal Engine) and focusing on some much needed features would benefit the next Heat game. This will do me for now and maybe I might change this review later on, but a part of me still thinks this game could have been so much better.\n\nFinal Score: 6.8\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\n\u2022\tIncludes NASCAR National Series: Monster Energy, Xfinity, and Camping World Trucks.\n\u2022\tBasic Paint Booth for your car which can be used in career mode. \n\u2022\tCustom Winning Anthems which plays after you win a race. \n\u2022\tGreat Music \n\u2022\tGreat Menu \n\u2022\tGreat Gameplay \n\u2022\tImproving cars depends on how well you do in each race for your team. Do good and you \n        gain momentum, which helps improve the car's performance for the next race.\n\u2022\tNight Tracks look great!\n\u2022\tSpotter is good and useful!

You can still drive your car after having a \n        major wreck. Performance will be bad but there is no way of ending a race with a DNF.  \n\u2022\tThe game has crashed for me multiple amount of times. For example clicking on schedule in \n        career mode quits the game. (During Intro Season) I\u2019ve yet dared to press it again.\n\u2022\tLack of TV presentation. I want to feel like I'm watching the real thing while playing it. (See \n        NASCAR 15/F1 2016)\n\u2022\tSometimes the menu can be sluggish and slow, for example like selecting the multiplayer menu.\n\u2022       Missing driver images when selecting the driver/car you want to play as.\n\u2022\tNo Flashbacks (If this isn\u2019t a sim, which I would love it to try to be. Than why no flashbacks?)\n\u2022\tNo Create Your Own Teams (So far\u2026)\n\u2022\tNo Buying Other Teams / Hiring Divers\n\n[b]Informational / Miscellaneous[/b]\n\n\u2022\tYour Steam ID is your racing name for both offline and online races.\n\u2022\tYou can create your own racing driver, both male and female. But it's hard to customise with \n        the NASCAR baseball \n        cap blocking the view.\n\u2022\tWhen you pause the game the American flag still moves when everything else is frozen still. \n        You can see it when you\u2019re driving towards the chequered flag.\n\u2022\tA few users have had problems setting up their game while using a wheel such as the \n        Logitech G920, G27 and the \n        Thrustmaster Ferrari F430. Playing on Xbox or PlayStation 4 controllers work fine.\n\u2022\tBystanders / Patrons look PS1 tier of graphics.

NH2 is not perfect but its better than the last versions of NASCAR we have had here on Steam. If you are looking to replace NR2k3, this isnt it... but  this is actually a  fun casual game. The addition of the top 3 touring series is nice. The cars/trucks handle differently as well.  I know that I would have like to have seen  a more sim oriented approach, but for an arcade game its fun... Case in point, I hooked the apron in Richmond and had it half spun but nothing happened... the car snapped back straight. \n\nGraphically its ok - not the best but not the worst.   Maxed out on my system it looks ok -  but not what we should have for 2017. The vsync issue isnt one if you know how to use nVidia Nspector... just lock it there and you wont need to worry about it.  \n\nThe pros are that its a massive improvement, and its actually fun  - not nearly as frustrating to deal with as the last few titles... and for that alone its worth a look.  The 3 touring series, the career mode, are nice to have too. The challenges bring me back to the old school Nascar Heat from 2000/01 ish, and are enjoyable.  \n\n\nAnother thing I do enjoy about this version  - the REAL cars... none of those fake schemes.. or lower tier drivers in cars they never drove. Plus if you verify your age you get the beer cars... not a major deal to some but its a nice touch. \n\nThe cons for me at this point are the sound (isnt close to being what the real thing sounds like), the lack of pace car/manual caution laps, and the handling... its just too arcade for me. That said, I mainly got it to split screen with friends who are casual players, and its already been a big hit. \n\nId also like to have received the #41 Daytona winner post race car that console users got. \n\nId like a more robust replay system but its not a deal breaker at this point.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505269551, "timestamp_created": 1505266795, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561198011798933", "num_reviews": 30, "num_games_owned": 131, "last_played": 1506395865, "playtime_forever": 683}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35011275", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505219", "review": "Improved.
