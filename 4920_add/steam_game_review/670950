You jump across several different stages in order to fight a boss at the end  whilst shooting enemies in your path (very mega man esque). This game is pretty short, but it can be replayed over and over if you want to put a speedrun aspect into it, or if you didn't pick up all the collectables throughout your first playthrough. The multiplayer is even pretty well done, it works like a deathmatch between the players and turned out to be a lot more fun than I anticipated. It's definitely worth the $5 the developer is asking.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503755432, "timestamp_created": 1503755432, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058915612", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 158, "last_played": 1503755050, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34428248", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498235", "review": "As someone who both enjoys side-scrollers and loves Robin Hood, I really enjoyed this game. As soon as I saw the Fox Hood skin option I was desperate to unlock it (hitting my nostalgia there). It was a pretty short game; I totaled about an hour and 20 minutes of playtime by the time I completed the final boss, though that includes some backtracking after the game crashed. \nI had a bit of trouble figuring out the controls at first. WASD and Space were intiutive, but it took me forever to figure out that you use the arrow keys to shoot your arrows. There was nowhere to look up key bindings, so I was just poking at different keys for a while.\nThe graphics and music are bright and fun, and the controls handle well. The levels have plenty of baddies to shoot (some with more spite than others- lookin' at you, OWLS) and lots of money bags to loot, while the bosses offer a nice challenge. I expect to play through the game again in the near future, and consider my money well-spent.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503455365, "timestamp_created": 1503455365, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198118337684", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 45, "last_played": 1503453672, "playtime_forever": 84}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
