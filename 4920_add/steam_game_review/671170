Though some serious tweaks to UI and Gameplay could be made to increase the fun of this game;\n\n>It is very difficult to know where your little people are, when you highlight them. When you click their portrait in the bottom left, you only get their stats and not what they are currently doing, at least it is not immediately clear what they are doing. Maybe a little arrow above that persons head, or a highlight of some sort. Whilst the colours of the shirts are somewhat unique, it gets pretty difficult when you got 8+ little people who have similar shirts (white with black sleeves, or white with brown sleeves) to know where they are. Especially since some of the most unique features about them are often blocked by an activity they are doing (hair covered by VR headsets, or shirts covered by back of chairs when streaming).\n\n>The Mini-Games are extremely easy. However sometimes my clicks don't register properly. Often the cursor changes when you are highlighting the correct area, yet you still get the \"MISS!\" message come up after clicking. This is mostly prominant in the Fighting Mini-Game where you have to hit the head. Whilst the Glove does get a white outline when you're mousing over the right part, upon click you still get \"MISS!\". The other Mini-Game I get this issue is the FPS, especially when the target is in a corner and covered by a blue target. Even still pressing the part of the Red Target you can see with the Green Crosshair cursor appearing sometimes comes up as a \"MISS!\".\n\n>The hardest part of this game I found was the grind after the 2nd Championship (If you count the Tutorial one as the first). As all the areas in Southern Europe and Asia require some pretty high stats. Almost every single one of these required some grinding, and even then I was only able to complete some of them after beating the championship that they are meant to represent first. Perhaps the events on the world that get unlocked could be a little more tailored for the skill range you are currently at, rather than you complete a Championship and then ignore the new place you unlock until you beat that Championship. Logically it should be that either completing a Championship should unlock the next tier of events for you to attempt (rather than they being two tiers above you, I found) or you get the next regions Championship, and once you complete it, that region unlocks. For instance, currently if you complete Africa, you unlock the events in South Europe and the Middle East along with that Championship. The events in New Delhi etc were pretty difficult to even get the 1 star on with my current team, and required me to complete the rest of the Africa ones first before even trying to attempt the next tier. And by the time I was ready to attempt that tier, I could go and complete the championship anyway since I had completed enough events to do it.\n\n>It is not immediately clear you can 'Evict' or 'Fire' your gamers by dropping them in the Trash in the bottom right. If I missed this in the tutorial, please feel free to ignore this point. I spent a large majority of the game with some sub-standard people who only did Scrims until I realised I could fire them.\n\n>Scrims appear far too often. It's a constant bombardment of them. It wouldn't be a pain if the latter game didn't require you to have to grind skills and manage Ego so much, but the consistant messages of \"CLAN XYZ WANTS TO SCRIM\" and the Fame penalty of declining or having to find some space in your build (FYI, there is little space towards the end of the game if you fill your rooms) and then find some people who you don't know what they are doing (See Point #1) is utterly frustrating. Eventually I lost 200 fame because I was just trying to raise my gamers points, which would have taken so much longer if I accepted every single one of these Scrims.\n\nAside from that, it's actually quite a nice game to just sit back, enjoy the humour, recognise some YouTubers who have been put in (AntiSepticEye for instance) and listen to an Imperial rendition of \"Still Alive\" (or at least it sounds like \"Still Alive\") from Portal during the Championships. I bought for \u00a36.49 or so, and it probably will last me another hour or two before I complete it. I don't feel there is going to be much replayability unless there is a New Game+ mode added or something similar. The jokes don't really change much per tournament, so the humour is a one-time only affair. Maybe a little variety on the humour would make people enjoy coming back to tournaments.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503019668, "timestamp_created": 1503019660, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197971703379", "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 1369, "last_played": 1503255857, "playtime_forever": 345}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34419860", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498090", "review": "Got it for the lulz, didn't dissapoint.
