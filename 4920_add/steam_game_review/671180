My review is my own opinion and unbiased.\n\nIf you've ever played those games on mobile where you tap to moves troops from building to building while carefully managing troop generation within the buildings - this game is basically that at the core.\n\nWhere this game differs, however, is the fact that it features both a single player campaign, as well as three (as of now) multiplayer modes, and a skill tree that as you level you invest points in.  You can also use spells in battle to alter structures or give them buffs/debuffs.\n\nI've only played ~1 hour so far, and I played through the first of the 3 campaign \"acts\", as well as tried out a couple multiplayer matches.  I can't say how their matchmaking performs, I don't know if they have any algorithms to match you with people of a certain level or not.  However, from what it looked like to me, the multiplayer mode is ranked only (i.e. your rank moves up or down depending on wins/losses) so there doesn't seem to be an un-ranked multiplayer mode.\n\nOne of the multiplayer modes lets you team up with someone else to defend some buildings against an attacker, which is pretty cool.\n\nThis game is fairly fun and simple in terms of core gameplay, but the spells and structure types add a fun layer of depth and strategy.  However on larger maps with a lot of structures, you will need to be REALLY good at multitasking (monitoring structure numbers, buff/debuff generation, clicking/selecting multiple buildings to move troops or collect buffs, watching for incoming enemy advances, etc.).  If you're not a fan of games that require multitasking, I doubt you'll like this very much.\n\nGraphics are simplistic and colorful, the music is cheery (albeit sort of annoying - maybe add some new tracks?  More relaxing stuff maybe?  I doubt everyone wants to listen to the same march-y sounding music all the time.\n\nThe price point of $5 (as of 08/25/2017) seems accurate for this game.\n\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8/10", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503671372, "timestamp_created": 1503671372, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198048628640", "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 185, "last_played": 1503670624, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34403452", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500272", "review": "A month ago I saw this game, and I thought that I hadn't played such games for a long time.\nAnd I can say that the game had completely met my expectations.
