There are four directions with 5 lanes in every direction. There are a dozen levels or so, and you have to pass them at least three times each (I'm on the second lap). \n\n\nThe ugly:\n* Smartphone port.\n* Lots of tap mechanics that only really works well on phones and tablets.\n* Entire levels dedicated to tapping enemies (well, one level really).\n* No hotkeys.\n* Can't close dialogs with escape. But escape opens a quit-dialog.\n* Escape opens a new quit-modal every time, and you have to close all of them.\n* No pause. (Not even the quit dialog(s) pauses the game.)\n* There are bad translations all over the place. Sometimes incomprehensible.\n* You are handed money after losing a few times. It feels really cheap.\n\nThe not so ugly:\n* The graphics are crisp and colourful and does not suffer much from having been scaled from mobile.\n* I'd say the idea and implementation is fairly unique, but maybe that's me who haven't played enough games.\n* The game feels polished. The upgrades are atleast somewhat balanced.\n* The first trip through the levels was pretty bland. Much more hectic tapping than actual strategy.\n* When the second \"classic mode\" unlocks, that feels much more sane and you have to actually consider where you invest your upgrade points. (Upgrade points are refundable at any time.)\n\nThat's all I have for now. It actually seems promising and the gameplay has grown a bit on me. But I still feel a bit dumb for participating in all this tapping using a mouse. The game is likely much better on a handheld device.\n\nI cautiosly recommend, but not at full price.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501861393, "timestamp_created": 1501861393, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975373553", "num_reviews": 48, "num_games_owned": 1162, "last_played": 1501861917, "playtime_forever": 205}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
