The game is very pretty, I was rather impressed with this games art style,[u] \" this is not some cheap RPG maker game\"[/u]. I found the Art style quite unique & very pretty at times. I really enjoyed every moment I was playing this game, & it was hard for me to stop playing.[/i]\n\n[b] REMEMBER to manually SAVE the game ALOT, as game does NOT auto save, its easy enough to find via start button/pausing, you will see all the features, like map, weapons you can equipt, once you do aquire them. Its easy enough to work out.[/b]\n\n[i]The main character you play is a Male called Edge, but you can rename him if you like. Edge is a mean spirited kind Of character & wants to get his 5 swords back that where taken from him before he was placed into a very long sleep by the gods. Be aware that there are some dialogs you may read that might shock you, or not!, I myself  found them all rather funny. I have never played and RPG game before that would make me laugh at times like this game did. Some people may not like the dialogs used, but they never bothered me, laughter is very good for us all, & I enjoyed them all.[/i]\n\n[i] The game has 2 very large maps, which you can access via pause menu & since it is now fully released it has had numerous updates with more content added including more steam achievements  & Trading Cards added as well. Time for me to to play some more, since now it has side quests & even tournaments added for more replayability value.[/i] \n\n[i] GOKEN is currantly on sale till the 9th of October at 25% off, you wont see the discount because the developers said there was an issue getting things set up in time & full pricing added, they needed 30 days notice and seems this was a last minute, full release desision, unless Im wrong?. [/i]\n\n[b] I have really enjoyed my time immensly with GOKEN and for me it did NOT disapoint, but I speak for myself & not for others ok. The developers are very nice and very active with regards to thier game. So any questions dont be afraid to ask them ok [/b] \n\n[h1]Store page tells a better story than I can, just know this for me game was well worth the EA risk & Im very pleased with the final out come. ENJOY GOKEN it is a very nice RPG game in my personal opinion[/h1]\n\n[b]Congratulations to  GIANTY Inc.  you made a very nice game THANK YOU Greatly :) [/b]\n", "votes_down": 12, "language": "english", "comment_count": "11", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506735640, "timestamp_created": 1506735640, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "steamid": "76561198079335824", "num_reviews": 98, "num_games_owned": 4216, "last_played": 1506941020, "playtime_forever": 2399}, "votes_up": 50, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34782970", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513409", "review": "Even in though it's still in Early Access GOKEN is an impressive action JRPG with beautiful graphics,an impressive enemy variety,a deep character progression system and a variety of weapon found in the game's world that gradually expand it's real time action gameplay.\nOverall the game is already really awesome and it shows great promise.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504730984, "timestamp_created": 1504730968, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198160868511", "num_reviews": 265, "num_games_owned": 433, "last_played": 1504449355, "playtime_forever": 1255}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35397351", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502896", "review": "\u2013 [b]25 hours[/b] to finish game [i](w/ 20/23 achievements, all chests found.. probably)[/i].\n\nYou can continue playing the game even after 'the final battle'.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507068902, "timestamp_created": 1506894404, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2062, "steamid": "76561198016977616", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 37, "last_played": 1507155482, "playtime_forever": 2062}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35470722", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510389", "review": "just finished the game and let me say this game is very SHORT! \n\nthe story isn't great. 3/10 \ngameplay fight mechanics of the game feels like it was made in the 90s. 3/10\nthe stages do differ but the monsters are just the same with different colors. 5/10\nto be honest I have no idea why it was given many great reviews. \n\nthe only good part about the game is its art. it's beautiful. other than that it is not a game to waste money on.\n\nand this game is definitely NOT like Bastion !!! no idea why people were saying this!", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507121832, "timestamp_created": 1507121832, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 430, "steamid": "76561198017443042", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 200, "last_played": 1507121178, "playtime_forever": 430}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35302677", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495657", "review": "Super game if you like ys series then u will definitely like goken.
