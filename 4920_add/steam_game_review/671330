The character design and art is pretty and the way you solve the puzzles is really fun. Um some may have trouble with the little window because as you move, it also moves but that's usually because there is a better way around the obstacle. The controls are simple, the game itself is relaxing and challenges you a little. It doesn't have much of a story but it is exsecuted in a clever way and it is better than a lot of other platformer games I have played.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505223502, "timestamp_created": 1505223502, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198097644428", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 38, "last_played": 1505383286, "playtime_forever": 74}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
