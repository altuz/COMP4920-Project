Brickochet adds more features to the game, and its graphic design is more classical. There is only one thing I prefer DxBall: In Dxball, you can press f5 to change the background music (there is no background music by default). There are many tracks to choose in Dxball, and I think the music is better than that in this game. This is just a matter of taste.\n\nIf you are insterested in dxball, you can play online here: http://dx-ball.ru     or you could just search in google for a downloadable version.\n\nAfter talking so much about Dxball, I personally recommand this game over Dxball.

It takes a good amount of skill/experience as well as some luck to be able to get through all 50 levels in one go. In a way, it has a strategic element depending where you initially direct your first few ball bounces -- can make an impact if you lose a life in some levels. I recommend experiencing every level at least once, likely through level select, just so you can be mentally prepared for some of the more tougher levels. \n\nWhile the game is quite tough at some points, it also can be rather relaxing watching the ball hit bricks, blowing up stuff, and grabbing some pretty neat power-ups. The gameplay is solid, especially the accuracy of the various angles the ball can hit off the paddle. I\u2019ve played a few other brick breaker games over the years, and I\u2019ve yet to experience such high precision until now.\n\nThe only place I\u2019d say is a minor downside is the music. For the most part the music fits with the \u201cbrick breaking theme,\u201d but I find some tracks fall short and can get a tad annoying. But the music can be changed with the push of a button, or be turned off entirely.\n\nIn the end, this game is highly enjoyable and has a pretty good amount of replayability.
