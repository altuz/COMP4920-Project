Some of them can be charming but flawed. I happen to like a good number of them. However, this is pure, unfiltered garbage on par with Digital Homicide titles. No, actually, I think those were slightly better.\n\nBefore we get into the meat and potatoes of this pile, the majority of my game time was trying to get this \"game\" to work. Yes, I saw the warning about integrated graphics cards, but I never expected that I would have to perform arcane rituals with my laptop to actually get it to start. Afterward, it ran pretty well. That's probably the only good thing I can say about it.\n\nFirst off, the main character looks like a 16 year old virgin's wet dream. The *cough* heroine's *cough* boobs are improbably huge along with most of the main characters in this game. The characters are plastic inside and out, looking like bad Oblivion nude mods and about as entertaining as listening to your dog being put to sleep.\n\nStripper Anya makes her way through some dull Wonderland and does her amazing 3-hit combo on multicolored cosplay rejects and some borderline racist caricatures. You get a fireball attack after the second boss...which only hits one enemy at a time and you'll notice the recharge delay.  Then you encounter bosses with 666 hp and a stupid gimmick (i.e. wait for the boss to recharge before you can hit them once and only once for 15 damage) to defeat them. I gave up at the 3rd boss and I'm not sorry.\n\nFinally, there's the whole #girlpower and #freethenipple on the start screen. No, this isn't empowering towards women. This is childish and pretty damn degrading. Trying to prop this game up as something positive is like saying that Doom is Evangelical Christian propoganda.\n\nAnyway, if you want a brawler with nudity, go for Badass Babes, Age of Barbarian or Dragon Knight.
