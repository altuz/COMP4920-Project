Roads and things like that are created automatically. So there really is no strategy to it, just place things on the grid. Every building is the same squared size.\n\nAs a Tower Defense? Well you can't really call it that, there are no towers to build.\nThere is 1 archer at the top of a wall, that you can click so he fires 1 arrow, damage upgradable.\nThere is 1 soldier running around outside the wall, that will hit enemies that randomly spawn, he is upgradable.\nThere are some spells, but they were buggy and didn't seem to work, I think they are something your soldier casts automatically.\nOnce again there's no real strategy involved here, just click an upgrade when you can afford it.\n\nThe only real good thing I can come up with to review this game is that it looks kind of fun when you look at the screenshots. Some have pointed out that there is no good tutorial, but this is also a good thing, since there's really nothing to learn.\n\nOnly reason I got this game is because I mistook it for the long awaited sequel to Farm of Souls, another free game you can check out that is better both as an Idle Game and City Builder.\n\nAnd finally, the game takes 10 times the amount of space you would expect, 2 GB, weird.\n\nPROS :\n- Short Tutorial.\n\nCONS :\n- Everything is bad.\n\nCONCLUSION :\n- Don't buy this, Buy almost anything else.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501091739, "timestamp_created": 1501075215, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198059599736", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 374, "last_played": 1501074324, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33806628", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508111", "review": "No, its not a complex game. Whoever tagged this \"city builder\" must be a very casual player :)\n\nIts essentially a copy of Adventure Capitalist where you place buildings (which costs coins) to generate more coins in the same time.\nAt least you do not have to click the houses to get the coins, those are automatically collcted (see Adventure Capitalist).\nYou can buy an upgrade (an overseer or mayor) which will then collect those coins even while you are not playing it (being offline).....like Adventure Capitalist.\n\nThe only thing that appears to be different, this game tries to add some complexity by having (constantly) attackers (orcs or goblins) and by adding villagers and another currency (the villagers souls).\nWith this added currency you can upgrade a few things (like your hero who fights against the attackers).\nYou can upgrade your wall (which defends you against the attacks), you can add archers on the wall (which assist your hero, but appear to not fight automatically) and your hero (who at least fights automatically, as long as he is upgraded enough for the current level).\n\nYes, you can upgrade the buildings, you can upgrade other aspects of your town and your defenses, Yes, you can certainly invest time into this....but IMHO certainly not more than half an hour.\n\nI can't really recommend it. Its really a copy of Adventure Capitalist with some added complexity with villagers, souls and constant attacks against your town (which appear to do nothing when you have a hero leveled up enough). And it is not really that much fun either....well....maybe for someone really playing casual games on facebook and such :)\n\nWhether this is considered pricey or not, it is up to you.\n\nEdit 1:\nThe game uses 1.7 GByte to download at around 2.2 GByte on the harddisk. I am not sure why....\n\nEdit 2:\nThere are coins which need manual collections (or you buy the upgrades which should get those automatically as well to a certain degree). That does not help the game...its tedious.\nAdditionally there is no tutorial or explanation (only some written text)...so, you are on your own when it comes to souls and such...(not that much of an issue).\n\nEdit 3:\nI just encountered bugs...my hero has -500 health (he just stopped health regenerating out of the blue and declined all the time)....and declining. Guess that is not supposed to happen :)\n\nEdit 4:\nI got several updates (usually a couple of MBytes) so far, but I am unable to find any changelogs at all. It is not the only game which has this rather awful way to patch/update through steam but not inform what is being done...so, it is not particularly only this game. But it does not help to change my mind. \nFurthermore...the patches appear very small compared to the 1.7 GBytes of download which again begs the question how this game can really be this big. Is it really only the graphics/assets?", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501170541, "timestamp_created": 1501068318, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "steamid": "76561197964353001", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 628, "last_played": 1506849577, "playtime_forever": 119}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33869207", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496968", "review": "Fun concept, but way too many game breaking bugs.

It is a city building slash tower defence slash clicker style game. Your objective is to continually build up your city so that it earns you more coins to spend on more city buildings, wall defences, Archer and Priest powers and Hero stats. You can also spend them on various other unlockables too. HINT! Don't press Level Up until your hero is comfortably killing everything on the level you're on and maintaining max HP. If you level up too fast, your hero will die and you will be the only defence for your town which requires active clicking. So the best way is to buy buildings, raise coins, level up your hero stats, and when his HP Regen is comfortably keeping his HP at MAX, then level up and continue that system as you go along. Of course, at some point you will need to reset to continue with higher stats like most typical clicker hero games.\n\nThe game doesn't have a good tutorial, in fact, it has no tutorial aside from three things it tells you to do at the beginning and then it leaves you to figure the rest out. Dark Souls much? I mean common devs, a bit of a tutorial would have helped. You only get one hero so far from what I've gathered and he is pretty much you line of defence. Raise his level well and you'll do fine.\n\nOverall it's a good game and worth the price. You probably won't spend too much time on it, it is a clicker based game with a lot of grinding and some activeness on the players behalf but it is worth trying out.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500919779, "timestamp_created": 1500919586, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001203765", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 1160, "last_played": 1501003967, "playtime_forever": 95}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33861280", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493696", "review": "It's very stale and crappy, concept, interface and just about everything else about this game is shit.\n\n\nDO NOT BUY.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501264035, "timestamp_created": 1501264035, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996575826", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 120, "last_played": 1501178134, "playtime_forever": 291}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33777088", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486408", "review": "Great little game.", "votes_down": 9, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500946119, "timestamp_created": 1500946119, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198208716648", "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 93, "last_played": 1500946057, "playtime_forever": 173}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33775667", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479139", "review": "Fun", "votes_down": 10, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500938927, "timestamp_created": 1500938927, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198204073925", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 42, "last_played": 1501073273, "playtime_forever": 476}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
