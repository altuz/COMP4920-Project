On the store page it doesn't state it supports the oculus rift, but in my experience it's almost fully supported PROVIDING you have a 360 setup (there's no snap turning by way of the thumbstick here). I'll compare the best (imho) basketball games, so you can choose the one that suits you best:\n\nPhysics Comparison: \"Hoops VR\" has also good physics but the ball feels very heavy and it's difficult to give your shot the proper curve and \"Nothing but Net\" also has good physics but the ball feels light, you can't achieve a proper curve here either and the way you hold the ball in it is disorienting to me (the ball appears by design a bit above your controller). In VR Shoot Around the ball [strike]is still on the light side[/strike] weight is perfect after the 21st July update and the physics are spot on (you can properly curve your shot). Unfortunately no game to date accounts for different shooting styles [strike]and those of us who rely heavily on our followthrough to guide the ball are at a disadvantage[/strike] (EDIT: See update below - after the update i consider the followthrough in VR Shoot Around almost perfect now!)\n\nFeatures comparison: Hoops VR is just an arcade bball shooter. You try to make as many baskets as you can within a time limit and you can choose between a large (easy mode) and a realistic basket (hard mode). The appeal of Hoops VR is to make a name for yourself on the high score boards. It's good fun, but a bit shallow. Nothing but net on the other hand offers a full court to shoot hoops and play mini games against the AI and human opponents. It has some very unique modes like playing HORSE or a mode in which you throw the ball down the court to pass it to yourself (which is a very creative way of playing basketball in vr full court!). So if you're interested in full court and mini games go for Nothing but Net. VR Shoot Around is pretty shallow at the moment, you can just shoot in a half court and that's it. although i've read on the forums the dev is planning to add mini games as well. One notable thing about VR Shoot around is its video player though: You can load onto it a h.264 / aac video file from your pc and have it play on a tv, which you can place anywhere on the court. That's great for anybody that wants to watch a show or load his workout motivational tunes while shooting.\n\nIn conclusion i'm personally going to stick with this game as my go to bball vr experience, because of the physics. For those interested i'm gonna be posting a first look video later this day and i'll post the link here.\n\nEDIT: Short video with my first impressions https://youtu.be/3PUkXlaEGgg\n\nEDIT 21 July 2017: After a couple small but excellent updates, the physics are now superb! The rim stiffness and power are very realistic now and the angle was improved also - i now have to use a good followthrough for my shots to go straight. Sample 20 free throws after the 2 updates: https://youtu.be/W7J0YQDb8jc\n\nEDIT 27 July 2017: A sample of 100 shots from all over the court. No assists enabled, which makes it kinda tough to make a shot, but will help you judge the physics: https://youtu.be/YnLpKvOeVH8", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501187276, "timestamp_created": 1500134285, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081159072", "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 265, "last_played": 1502523109, "playtime_forever": 258}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33733972", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "If BALLisLIFE....then this game will be the best money you've ever spent.

Lots of opportunities with this game to be a major hit. One of the few games on Vive I was happy to pay for.\n\nOnly cons-\n\nA) Kind of annoying to press Grip to get a new ball. Would prefer tapping the trigger if i clearly have no ball in my hand and there is no ball within a close distance (so I'm clearly not trying to pick up an existing ball).\nB) Related, would also like to be able to bounce the ball.\n\nFuture-\n\nA) Any plans to make this work with the kunckle controllers?

You can literally spend hours in this gym shooting around, practicing half court, corner 3pts and free throws. The physics from the rim, net and backboard are damn near 1 to 1 with the real world. I got my brother and father to come check it out and they  fell in love with it as well. If you a basketball fan, pick this up! You cant beat it for $5 USD. Do yourself a favor and pick this up and prepare for a sore arm in the process lol you going to spend ALOT of time in this gym!\n\nSean\nBearArms Bullet Bracelets\nwww.BearArmsBracelets.com", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500707400, "timestamp_created": 1500707400, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988443396", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 33, "last_played": 1504398914, "playtime_forever": 156}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
