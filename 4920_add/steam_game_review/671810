This game seems very imaginative and cool conceptually (a pirate, dreams, etc..) but its execution and implementation is horrible.  \n\nThe best thing this game has going for it is its unique setting of creepy goblins versus a pirate dude in somewhat \"dreamy\" locales. Unfortunately, playing the game is a complete mess, with very little feedback or explanation to any of the combat or actions you take. Instead, you're just thrown into the opening levels with a ton of goblins swarming you, who constantly jump and flail around wildly swinging their clumsy attacks as you do the same, flailing your sword and just assuming that you're hitting them, aside from an obnoxious \"bell-like\" sound that triggers every now and again I suppose indicating that you're hitting them. There is a UI / comic-book looking \"ARGH\" that pops up over and over from you and the enemies, meant to indicate damage being done (I guess?) but it all just feels very sloppy, like most of the game.\n\nThere is very little structure to anything you're doing, and not in an abstract, charming, minimalistic way present in other games but instead it comes off shoddy and poorly put together. You aren't even told what to do beyond there being an Exit cave in one of the rooms of the level you need to eventually reach. For example, during one level with about 15 of the same generic looking goblins running around aimlessly, apparently I needed to defeat all of them in order for the Exit tunnel to be activated (despite it being visible) So I had to spend a few minutes swinging at and hoping to hit this higher health, different colored (but same model) goblin, flailing my attack against him until he eventually just disappeared, then I could go through the exit. The next level consisted of a very simplistic platforming area, but the character's jumping and landing handles so horribly it's like trying to navigate an icy surface everywhere, with your character landing and then drifting an extra 2 or 3 feet to fall off the ledge and force you to restart the sequence. The level after this involved a very basic looking sphere meant to be a boulder rolling back and forth down a tunnel which you would have to evade by hiding in a few alcoves, then reach the exit (EXCITINNNNNG) After this level it was another level strewn with goblins and some bland-looking 'traps' and my character became lodged in an overhanging log after jumping into it and couldnt get out, forcing me to quit, so I logged out of the game and am now writing this review.\n\nThere are signs scattered around the level that say things like \"Secret Passage (Under Construction)\" which is then just a boulder wall that clumsily retracts as you approach it. While I think this is a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment from the creator(s) that it doesn't look great, at the same time it pisses me off to see this kind of blatant \"HAHA our game kinda sucks, right???\" self-awareness after you've spent your money to experience the title. \n\nThis game might open up a little if you get past these horrible opening levels but I don't feel like bothering to sift through garbage just to ~maybe~ get a morsel of enjoyment from some of the later settings.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502572121, "timestamp_created": 1502571945, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "last_played": 1502570233, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
