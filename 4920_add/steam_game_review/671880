Most of the time I don't know if there are enemies to avoid or not since I just keep on summoning units and letting them advance on their own. I love how I could spam units to overrun my enemies.

The game has a built-in replay where you can watch your playthroughs. It doesn't seem to have much replay value, unless you're a speed runner.\n\nWant to see how chaotic with bots, enemies, bullets, lasers, etc. your screen would be in the last few stages of the game?
