Their openness and willingness to work with the community seems to be genuine and I do not feel it would be right to not inform people of the positive steps taken in that regard.\n\nThat said, I still cannot recommend the game at this time as it feels promising, but far from finished. I feel the game is better off in Early Access and continued to be developed. At this point, it is still exceptionally buggy and does not do much to inspire enjoyment of the game.\n\n\n\n** ORIGINAL REVIEW STATEMENT BELOW**\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aL0MLoJWfeI\n\n\nThe publishers of this game have threatened legal action against Steam users in an attempt to silence criticism over the english translations both within the game and on the Steam storefront. They have since deleted the discussion thread and banned all users that commented within the thread in order to attempt to hide from the fully justified fallout that is likely to come as a result of their actions. Please do not support these people in any way.\n\nThe game itself feels only half-finished. It seems the Developers gave up on a number of features. It shows promise, but falls flat on it's face. Poor animations that are out of sync with your actions, text only character interactions, and no meaningful introduction to the game's mechanics or story. Framerate drops and glitches run rampant through what little of the game that I have played so far. Even if the Publishers were not deplorable excuses for human beings, I still would not be able to recommend this game unless it were patched HEAVILY.", "votes_down": 13, "language": "english", "comment_count": "29", "votes_funny": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501298810, "timestamp_created": 1501213273, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030863487", "num_reviews": 174, "num_games_owned": 427, "last_played": 1501199301, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 524, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33548565", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588048", "review": "I saw 2 reviews for this game, so thought I would pick it up and see if its worth telling people about.  I like indie developers, and I don't mind putting up with some rough mechanics if there's a fun game underneath.\n\nSadly, what I hoped would be a review of praise, is instead a warning for all buyers interested.  Do not buy this game.  The following list is why:\n\nLong load even with an initial SSD\nTerrible English translation\n\nTutorial:  Doesn't make sense.  You're not sure what to go or click on half the time, and you stumble through it to start the game.\n\nCamera:  A bad design choice for this style of game.  The camera is too low, so the 3D walls get in the way as you turn it.  There is no auto Camera, meaning you must continually manually fix it as you move through a maze of coridoors.\n\nGeneric keybinds for this type of game do not function.  I ended up having to click to open my inventory, then click to open my character, then click to equip.  Oh, and discovered I had stat points to raise that the game never told me about.\n\nThe Big One:  The gameplay is awful.  Being a diablo-like, you would think, \"I can hold down the button to basic attack\".  No, you can't.  \"Ok, I'll just click then.\"  Except that the clicks don't always respond.  This right here kills the game, when the core gameplay is a mess.\n\nI will say the music is nice, and the dungeon is decent looking, but it has so much to go before I could call it a finished game, even at its price point.

But i can't recommend this game and the reason is that it wont let me play it.  My rig can run Ghost Recon Wildlands on utra settings with no issues, however i take 2 steps in the tutorial and it crashes every time.

I don't believe it is, as I did not see anything saying it was. This game is very clunky, the movement, camera control and combat is all very clunky. Many games of this ilk from that era had similar problems, and going forward those games have gotten a lot smoother, and because of that, are a joy to play.\n\nThis game has a very big problem with how the game is controlled, and how bad it feels to play. I have nothing to say regarding the story, or graphics, as I am less concerned with those things, than I am with how bad this game feels to play. It is not enjoyable combat, it is not convenient controlling the camera and windows. You cannot open up inventory using I, or your character screen with C like most RPG's. The options were very limited, with nothing regarding controls, so maybe you can open up the windows with keyboard presses, but I would never know.\n\n The tutorial stage is annoying to the point of wanting to gouge out my eyes. Developers really need to learn how to make tutorials, without making them feel so onerous and annoying. \n\nThis game has some interesting features, with upgrading of castle features, to make better crafted items and the like, but honestly that is overshadowed by how not fun this game is to play because of the clunkiness. I really need to say clunky one more time so everyone understands how it feels. \n\nTLDR  The game is clunky, and feels bad to play. It is not fluid, and you get stuck inside enemies unable to hit them for no reason. Save your money, do not buy this game unless the dev actually puts effort into making the game feel fluid, and stop wasting time on making an interesting castle crafting system.", "votes_down": 17, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1499985820, "timestamp_created": 1499985820, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006524453", "num_reviews": 43, "num_games_owned": 668, "last_played": 1499985433, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 153, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33531034", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450585", "review": "In a time where games alays look for more realism and complicated content but feel almost always a bit bland, DoS brings a welcome reminder that games are made to be fun, and has also a nice atmosphere.

The monsters which seem quite amusing at the beginning, start making you feel stressed on the level 4. The wolves were chasing me till the very end. Crafting takes a lot of efforts. Unfortunately, the developer did not provide an adequate tutorial that made me escape from monsters for some time. Use the weapon taken as a reward.
