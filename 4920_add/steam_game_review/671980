If anyone else has finished the game and has some insight I woud love to know). \n\nI honestly found it really good. The puzzles are difficult enought to keep me interested, but not so difficult as to make me give up. I'm not easily scared at all, but can definitly appreciate the creepy factor (there was one part that make me squeak a bit because it startled me).\n\nAll in all, while interesting, the story itself is confusing, and I'm not really sure what is going on, but I think that is how the maker wanted it. \n\nThe only critisim I have is to make the fact that the game is over more obvious. Because there is literally nothing else I can do, but I can still go in the game and wonder about aimlessly despite having done everything (based off what I have read on the community posts).", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506504032, "timestamp_created": 1506504032, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 330, "steamid": "76561198070370081", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 42, "last_played": 1506503616, "playtime_forever": 330}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35348435", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500242", "review": "Bought this and wasn't quite sure what to think when it first started, but after playing and finally beating the game all I can say is wow! This game is amazing and totally immerses you! It gets very dark and creepy the more you play.  Recommend playing in the dark with headphones to get the full experience. It is as the game says.
