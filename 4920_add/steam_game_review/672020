Not the best exchange rate there is, but you can get drunk in this game, and it's got lots of humanoids in it. Shooting, skateboarding, and frogger. I liked the shooting game because it was pretty hard if you drink the beer and it is very tonque and cheek to get e-drunk then mistakenly shoot the person holding the targets. Skateboarding was a bit hard, and the granny-crossing-the-road like frogger game was too hard to play. Doesn't really matter, it's pretty cool for 2 dollars.
