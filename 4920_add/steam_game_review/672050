And while I did a little bit, I can't really reccomend it. First, I'm going to start with my favorite thing: the animations. While it didn't remind me of Ren And Stimpy, it instead reminded me of Rocko's Modern Life, which is still a really good thing. And while some of people's complaints is the control scheme is bad, I thought it was okay. The thing that was disappointing was the gameplay. The first level, with the weird cockroach guy, was really hard. However, I was just barely able to graze through it normally, so I did a bit of spamming. After that, I couldn't get past the skeleton guy. Last thing is the price. I would've gotten this for maybe half of it's price, but I thought $5 was a little much for this. Overall, unless you can master the intensity of the game and you've played enough arcade fighters, I can't recommend it. For what seems to be Five Entertainment's first game, this is a disappointing start, but I wish them well on any future endeavors.\n\n4/10\n\nAlso, controller support would've been nice.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505253911, "timestamp_created": 1505253798, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198269016245", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 29, "last_played": 1505254105, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34903018", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480185", "review": "I really like Ren and Stimpy, and I wanted this to be fun.\nIt is not fun.
