That ain't bad. It looks good and the environment is cozy, and you can fly around it to get close to the scenary. There is some kind of AR mode where the animes is rendered against the backdrop of your room through the camera. I did not try it, but it's a great idea, and I'm sure it works as well as it can with the Vive's single camera. Just the fact that is there is pretty impressive. [spoiler]Also you can use your tracked motion controllers to do that thing (you know what I'm talking about) and they move and there is force feedback and sounds.[/spoiler] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1099935914", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504407857, "timestamp_created": 1504407857, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961017729", "num_reviews": 236, "num_games_owned": 2716, "last_played": 1501833155, "playtime_forever": 57}, "votes_up": 26, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33671870", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525413", "review": "Bought it to try out the AR implementation.\n\nGood try, but much like you'd expect, the Vive camera isn't useful for AR stuff in general. The biggest problem is it's monoscopic. With no depth from the camera, your real hand will render behind the camera and seem gigantic by comparison, throwing off any sense of scale to the environment.\n\nThe real effect of AR in VR right now is that it's some VR stuff rendered on top of a low resolution, grainy, monoscopic 360 video sphere that you kinda recognize as a rough low res facsimile  of the world just outside of the headset; rather than feeling like virtual objects are been rendered on top of the real world, as is the true goal of AR.\n\n2 dollars is the right price for this.

Other things you can buy with two dollars just don't amount to what you can do in this game. Sure you can buy a cup of coffee, or a bag of doritos, or a scratch off ticket, but those are all temporary. This game is not near as temporary as previous items mentioned. In this package, you get: 1 virtual living room and all furniture, 1 deck of cards, and 1 girl wearing pajamas. You can fondle said girl's boobies, as long as you don't mind the fact that she has this stare. The boobs make your controller vibrate, I guess to try and simulate what the real thing feels like, but I know nothing about that, as I'm a 46 year old single man who has never had a girlfriend, living in my great grandmother's attic. (Disclaimer: I lied about the last half of the sentence.) That stare that the pajama girl gives you instantly becomes creepy when you move behind her and her head looks as if it turns unnaturally. If you're willing to take the dive, you can even buy the blue pan-*cough cough*-schoolgirl suit expansion. It's pretty alright, too.
