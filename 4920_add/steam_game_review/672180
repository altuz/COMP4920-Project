Thumping chip-tuney EDM soundtrack and the pulsating lower-poly debris lend a charming atmosphere to the whole thing. Game has already seen two major point releases since launch which have already seen imrpovements from small tweaks like upping spawn rates in the early game, to impressive new mechanics like unique secondary abilities for the ships.  Well worth the couple of bucks!  Impressive first outing for this young studio.  Excited to see what the future holds for this game and future titles from Guy Bits.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506777700, "timestamp_created": 1506777700, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "steamid": "76561197991592631", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 182, "last_played": 1507034175, "playtime_forever": 110}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35469187", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "A fun spaceship shooter that keeps your reflexes sharp in hope of reaching that number one spot on the highscore board.
