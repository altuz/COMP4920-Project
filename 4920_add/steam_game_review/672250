That\u2019s a cool game. I like especially the gameplay which is really various. You can face the enemies and kill each of them, or you can try to steal through. So, every level has different ways of passing. There is also a wide range of weapons: usual grenade launchers, machine guns, and even energy blasters, and so on. If you can\u2019t pass the level you can just go to the next one. And I must say that some of them aren\u2019t so easy, as it seems firstly. This game is really exciting. Lots of levels, lots of fun. And it has a great music by the way!", "votes_down": 11, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501945873, "timestamp_created": 1501945873, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198111135105", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 36, "last_played": 1501939352, "playtime_forever": 163}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
