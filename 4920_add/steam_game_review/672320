However, the graphics and the monsters are gorgeous. The developer did a great job and paid attention to all details. The game plays very well and draws you in; you do feel you are really the last man standing defending the tree of life. I like the teleport touch and the fireball weapon (feels a bit like basketball :) \n\nThe game makes you look around and strategize agains carefully orchestrated monsters in each wave. I like the monster variety, and the big boss is super cool :)\n\nIt's a bargain for the price it's being sold.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506443546, "timestamp_created": 1506443546, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "steamid": "76561198310428808", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 42, "last_played": 1506442429, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
