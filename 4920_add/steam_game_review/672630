Since a lot of people have mentioned Prison Architect, I will agree it has a very similar vibe but is very, very simplified even from fairly early stages of Prison Architect's Alpha phases.  I don't think the game is so complex that a tutorial is in any way neccessary right now.  If you're familiar with other sim games, you'll figure out how to get started and going fairly easy, and like Prison Architect Alpha it has a to-do list as the basis of some guidance.  The only thing that was less than intuitive with the GUI was how to set boys and girls bathrooms.  If you go to edit zone for the most part the only option is to remove the zone rather than actually make any changes to it, but it also gives you the option to change the bathroom gender and grade level for classes.  Other than that, the game is pretty simple and intuitive for those familiar with the genre.\n\nThat said, I'm only recommending it if you're interested in supporting the developers.  If you're hoping for a game as enjoyable as mid to late stages of Prison Architect alpha testing, you're going to want to wait a while.  Currently, there is absolutely no problems to manage in the game.  You start with ample funds to have students in small class sizes with the best teachers no problems.  There is no conflict that arises aside from frequently sick students due to a dirty school, but I'm not 100% sure why that's happening aside from my janitors being slackers, and there are no consequences for it.\n\nLong term, things that would likely improve the game are adding objectives/failure clauses such as ways to measure the student body as a whole's learning (though that might be a result of trauma from the American Education system, aha), more effort in attracting parents to transfer students to your school through meeting academic or musical/athletic goals with your students such as competitions you send specific students to and making more money possible only after reaching certain objectives.  The introduction of delinquents is a start on making the game more whole, but there's a long way to go to add depth.\n\nAlso, A+ for using the Prison Architect artist.

I absolutely love this game! If it keeps going well, this will be one of my top favorite of all time games. I subscribed to the subreddit, email, twitter and the youtube channel so I don\u2019t miss a single thing. If you liked or loved Prison Architect, you will feel the same way or stronger about Academia. It takes on a very similar gameplay and artwork to that game. I messaged the Dev on Twitter and sure enough, the artist from PA is on this game and he is working in a small group to make Academia. This is his own project and he is passionate about it. I expect great things from this game and I bought 2 copies right when I could on launch day. \nSummary so far:\n\tYou start out with a blank slate in an open canvas as you prepare to make your school. You have 3 zones already that you can of course change. You have deliveries, garbage, and an area for your workers. At this point, there are no scenarios or tutorials implemented yet but that should change over time. To get a sort of tutorial now, you can just take on a grant, finish the grant, then move to the next. In this way, you will get the idea and progress. I haven\u2019t played until end game or anything yet but I can see how it will progress based on what I\u2019ve done so far. The gameplay is similar enough to PA to know what to do intuitively but it is a different game still. You can hire at this point: janitors; teachers; workers; cooks and nurses. This game is based on a high school so there is freshman through senior classroom zones to make. There is even the ability to have a bathroom for men or women. This game looks, feels, and sounds great. It\u2019s a very positive experience so far. I would definitely recommend this game to add to your collection. \n\nPros:\n\u2022\tGreat art\n\u2022\tGreat music\n\u2022\tGreat UI experience\n\u2022\tIntuitive menus for building and management tasks\n\u2022\tSandbox mode for just playing around or experimenting\n\u2022\tGreat communication with players and perspective players\n\u2022\tA team that can be trusted in early access to deliver and not abandon the project\n\u2022\tTasks don\u2019t take too long to get done by workers\n\u2022\tBeing able to vote on the next game project for the devs\n\nCons:\n\u2022\tSome editing tasks can be tedious such as having to bulldoze grass if you lay down grass and want to change it to something else like concrete tiles\n\u2022\tNot enough tile and wall pieces yet\n\u2022\tLack of campaign so far\n\u2022\tLack of proper tutorial so far\n\u2022\tSlow loading to start the game\n\nVerdict:\n     I won\u2019t give a game that released practically a second ago a numerical value or something of the like. I can say that the issues with the game so far will most likely be fixed over time. I don\u2019t see my cons as permanent problems. I simply added them because they are there. If I were to recommend the game or not, I would always recommend it. This is a great start to what will become a great game. I say go for it! \n\nStill not sure:\n\tI can blame you if you don\u2019t know if you should get it or not. I recommend checking out the dev logs and gameplay videos on Youtube. I would also check out the site. That should help you decide for sure. Some games in early access are simply not worth getting yet until they fix and add more content.
