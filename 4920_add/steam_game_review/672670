I had alot of Fun with it...The Controls are Easy to Learn and Work Really Well, It Doesn't take some gettting use to stirring with your Head. Where you look is where you Go. Which, Works rather well I was Roaring through the Streets and Turning Sharp Turns bounce off of buildings or better said, ''Dragging My Face'' off of buildings...lol This Game is Good, It is Simply. But yet!, Hard. You have a Time Limit on your Hoverboard's Remote Controller and the Robotic Birds Are Fast! You're Fast Enough to Gradually Catch up to Em'...It Would of Been Nice, if they Gave you Some Boosters that Recharge to go even Faster. Because when you turn you slow down a good bit...But, Once you're Going you are Going and it feels pretty Fast! Sometimes it lags a bit at High Speeds. But, No Motion Sickness! But, I Really feel like I'm Flying.. I Felt Like the Green Goblin Ridng on his Hover Board and I Stole Spiderman's Gun Hunting Trash Talking Robotic Birds...Note to DEVS: You Know If you just Gave Us a Rocket Laucher Instead and Have The Robotic Birds Explode with Spectaclur Effects the Thrill of Hunting Down These Annoying Birds Would Be Much More Fun! If you like High Speeds you'll Like This Game. Try Flying Low to the Ground and Dodging the On Coming Traffic..I had a Blast! Just Flying Around is Worth the Money Spent! Really Cool Short Game! Decent Price Note: I got it while it was on Sale! With Some More Work this Thing would Be Great! But, Overall, it is Good! Feels Like I Own A Flyboard for less than $5 Right On!", "votes_down": 9, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500249582, "timestamp_created": 1500249582, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198376820898", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 177, "last_played": 1500255402, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
