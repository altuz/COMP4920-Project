Both games are about same (managing space colonies), but Planetside works better than StellarHub. So, if you are looking for space colony management sim - go for Planetside.\n\nAnd now for a little more expanded explanation - why I like Planetbase better:\n\n1. Mechanics - while both games operate on more or less same mechanics, some of StellatHub mechanics make little sense - the whole grid-based construction makes me feel a bit weird along with weird cimilarity of modules, when it comes to their look, but the main weirdness is, of course, solar power points and gas clouds. For comparison - in Planetbase you have freeform placement of modules and furniture in them, the only limit is number of connections your module can have. Solar power plants can be built anywhere and work based on day-night cycle. And, of course, you don't have to pay for a right to build a new module - all you need to supply the needed materials.\n\n2. Immerrsion. I hope that it would be improved in future, but right now Stellarhub does its best to break immersion in the game. Game does everything to show that it's just a flat map with sprites on top of it with little regard of what is there. Everyone walks over crates in the hub. Cargocrew digs into middle of the module and pulls crates from the floor. Sleeping outside of bedroom character rolls all over machinery in the room. Characters sitting in cantina sit above the table. As soon as you start to build something - everyone rushes there, because... because they love hanging in half-built zones instead of hanging in the lounge or bar or somewhere, where it would make sense. There are lots of sprites for sleeping, but there is only one for work for most crewmembers, so technican repairing something just kneels somewhere in the module (not even close to the problem point) and problem goes away. Things like oxygen leak don't seem to affect crew even slightest and they casually stroll into module with problem, etc, etc, etc.\n\nThere are some good points in the game - like ability to reassign your crew to do any task (In Planetbase - you can have a colony of food-producing botanists, who would happily die, because none of them would lift a finger to patch that broken oxygen generator) - but still it feels pretty unfinished at current state, bringing too little of its own mechanics and interesting points and a lot of weirdness like sun shining only over a special spot in space and so on.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505946144, "timestamp_created": 1505946144, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197987442837", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 669, "last_played": 1505943426, "playtime_forever": 52}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35396512", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501863", "review": "I've tried to like it and even suggested some poss fixes in the discussion boards.
