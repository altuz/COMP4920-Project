Enemy rabbits come at you from 3 sides while you're in a 3 way intersection.  Enemies spawns continually and gradually build up.  They all come straight towards you although when you shoot them they will usually bounce up in the air and when they get close they may jump around you and across you.  \n\nThere's basically 3 enemy types.  The bunnies (which turn dark after being shot), the big rabbit, and a strange dark mass that comes towards you quickly and will turn everything dark around you.  You have two guns with different special abilities.  The gun also upgrades along the way.  Most of the time, you're just mindlessly shooting at enemy spawns and then using your special ability when you're overwhelmed by enemies.\n\nIs it fun?  I didn't have fun.  It just felt like endless waves with little strategy involved.  The graphics are good and the game ran smoothly.  I think the voices used weren't particularly funny.  And the music wasn't memorable to me.  Game starts out very easy and the difficulty slowly ramps up.  Either way, I was bored.\n\nRating 4/10 only recommend for kids who want an endless wave shooter / cheap wave shooter \n\n\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506732812, "timestamp_created": 1506732812, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1506730842, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
