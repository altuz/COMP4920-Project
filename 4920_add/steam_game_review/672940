The most basic enemy takes half the hp of your most basic tower. And once you put your towers in the upper half of the screen, the enemies are almost always offscreen. \nYou spend more time repairing your tower that anything else.\nOne of the common strategy to play seems to lure the enemies in empty columns, then suddenly build a tower in front of them. This way, you can have enemies onscreen getting hit by more towers. \n\nLet's add that on the same screen, there are crystal deposits where you build stuff to get ressources, and you have special powers (depending from your character). Also, it's really strange that the devs choose to make a vertical layer, where an horizontal one would have given them far more space.\n\nAside the battle screen, there is a galaxy map allowing you to choose a level, and you have a small upgrade panel.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThis is a barebone Tower Defense where the main gameplay is not really interesting.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503805270, "timestamp_created": 1503805270, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198054157182", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 423, "last_played": 1503804454, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33983330", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500875", "review": "Save your money.
