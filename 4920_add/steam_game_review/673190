There's a weak drift system that can easily be abused, abilities that lack oomph or even discernable effects, characters who don't have faster or slower traits or even special vehicles, and sound that seems to wash things out so that you don't even FEEL like you're going fast, or FEEL like your ability really ruined someone's day. \n\nOn abilities, some are pretty useless, while others can single-handedly guarantee you last place. The theme of the game is fruit, yet many of the generic abilities have NOTHING to do with fruit. Again, they feel really weak, and you have no control of aiming them. You can't shoot behind you unless that ability is MADE to shoot behind you. Very limiting. Plus, to use an ability, you need to essentially pick up pips and charge it. That's not bad, but with the lack of payoff for ability EFFECTIVENESS, it feels pointless..\n\nOverall, there really doesn't feel to be a depth to this game. For as amazing as the characters and world looks, that's a shame. The balancing and uniqueness of the characters and abilities needs more work as well. I'll keep playing for sure, but as of now there really isn't much enjoyment in it :/", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504916956, "timestamp_created": 1504916649, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198083623701", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 159, "last_played": 1504972647, "playtime_forever": 60}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35062066", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "This is the Kart Racer you have been waiting for. Juicy graphics, delicious fun and full of vitamin C. \nIt is already my favourite Kart Racer on pc - but there are also lots of future good stuff in the pipeline. \nThe game works 'accidentally' in VR (I am guessing that the devs were not even aware of this!). The only thing that does not work in VR are the menus - but a youtuber (backed up by me and a couple of other guys) contacted the Devs about this and within hours they were on the case and full VR implementation is promised real soon (which, for one I believe, as these devs do not sit there twiddling their thumbs). \nSomeone else asked for a cockpit view 'sure' said the devs, and this too is coming in the next update. So, the devs are active and responsive  - I bought the game to support them because of this. I am really glad I did, it is a blast. A good solid (And very pretty) Kart racer that tick all the boxes and can be played in cockpit view *and* in VR - a dream come true. \n\nThe only issue I have at the moment is that booting the game somehow boots my rift and diverts the sound through the rift headphones. Not an issue for me, as it is too good in VR to play it on a flat screen. Again, the devs say that are fixing it for the next update (and I believe them). \n\nGood solid game with active development team - highly recommended.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505818373, "timestamp_created": 1505818373, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "steamid": "76561198057590719", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 245, "last_played": 1507040435, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35051029", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451014", "review": "Online mode is still WIP so..", "votes_down": 23, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505760884, "timestamp_created": 1505760884, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197983014610", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 357, "last_played": 1505760790, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
