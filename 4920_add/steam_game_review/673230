An old school shmup, bunch of upgrades, 13 ships to unlock (you start with 2 ships, to total 15).\n\nThere's a ton of shmups on Steam, this is a 2D game made in game maker studio. It has a bunch of nice details (your ship's spirte shows damage when hit, it can loose parts), music is fitting, it has a campaing and a survival mode, overall art and character portraits are well done, but there's little innovation in this tittle. All the way down to the space setting, is a very generic shmup.\n\n[b]I appreciate the linux build[/b] \n\nI'll update this review if there's anything else worth of attention.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506988593, "timestamp_created": 1506977310, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "steamid": "76561197987292682", "num_reviews": 119, "num_games_owned": 284, "last_played": 1507097377, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
