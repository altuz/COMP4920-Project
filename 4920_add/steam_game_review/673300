It's cheap, ugly, boring and no one wants it.\n\nASR is simplistic pseudo-retro platformer full of pandering for 'good old days' (namely project vice and contra) which brings nothing of value to the genre. It's a checklist 'retro' game. Faux 8bit, primitive soundtrack, moving platforms, elevators, lasers, pickups, instadeath pits etc.\nThe issue isn't the fact that it has nothing of it's own (like Axiom Verge or Shovel Knight), but the fact it isn't even good at ripping other games off (like Super Cyborg). If you are that 'retro' to the point of almost copying artwork, just make sure your game is actually any good in comparison.\nThe main story of the game is that Green Guy goes totally not ripping other games off and kills some Pink Blobs in the process. The same 5 types of pink blobs. Every level. Every small boring and repetitive level (with late ones being ugly too). Music is repetitive and not memorable, it's just a faux 8bit beeps you've seen millions of times. You'll fight the same enemies, jump the same platforms in different tilesets, pickup the same guns. Then there is bosses that look like slightly bigger pink blobs and they sometimes shoot stuff and die. Controls are simple, but a bit glitchy (which is rarely an issue though).\n\nTechnically the game runs and supports gamepads.\n\nWell, I think the game could provide a hour of entertainment for a low price if you have no other platformers to play, but you probably do - the genre is pretty healthy these days.", "votes_down": 13, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501461575, "timestamp_created": 1501461513, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197980206308", "num_reviews": 104, "num_games_owned": 2286, "last_played": 1501460327, "playtime_forever": 61}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
