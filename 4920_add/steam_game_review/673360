I quite enjoy the black mist that the game gets its name from.  It adds suspense to what would otherwise be a very bland game.\nThe lives system is also quite nice.  Instead of having a certain amount of lives and ammo, the two are combined.  Shooting uses Energy, which can be regained from falling enemies.  Energy also acts as a life force, so when you run out, it's game over.  You lose Energy when hit by enemies too.\nIt's clearly a game that was made with love, but without too much ambition.  It's a nice time killer if you want something more in-depth than cookie clicker, and brings some new ideas to the genre.\n7/10", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505868435, "timestamp_created": 1505868435, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198071845080", "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 330, "last_played": 1505970975, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
