This game looks good and the gameplay is fun.  It currently has only 3 levels and there are no unlocks.  The Mech level you don't need a controller for and the aiming reticle is used by moving your head around.  I can't decide if I can recommend this game because it froze on me 4 or 5 times in 20 minutes.  I recommended it in this review because it is a fun game and would like to see if others had any issues with it freezing as well before I wouldn't recommend it.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502398503, "timestamp_created": 1502398503, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053682704", "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 61, "last_played": 1502394859, "playtime_forever": 24}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
