What is there now shows nice graphics compared to that other \"airport\" game.  \n\nIt seems to me that there is no easy way to start ANY airport. In other words, unlike other sim games where you can start with something small and grow, I don't see that's the case here.  Certainly this game has a lot of similarities with Prison Tycoon and even Another Brick In The Wall.  But what this game lacks is no clear way to build up.  You have to build EVERYTHING at the same time... like RIGHT NOW.  \n\nYou have to lay the runway, the taxiways, the stands, the roads, and then the other type of roads - the service roads, but not before you separate them with that guard rail security shack thing, and you need a tower which doesn't appear to do anything, and then don't forget to add the bus stop and car dropoffs, and hire people, and the executive staff which unlocks contracts which you need to build the fuel, because without fuel nothing you built previously is going to make any difference, and of course the terminal with endless other check ins, info, you get it the picture.  \n\nThis all devolves into building everything at once, hiring everyone, checking all contracts, etc.  In other words there is no natural progression of the game as a tycoon game, once it's all unlocked because IT IS ALL NEEDED there is no tycoon game left.  You're left with a sandbox.  \n\nSure you get to schedule airlines, and stuff, but for the most part by the time you have a working airport, the simulation is DONE!\n\nIMO, the game would have been vastly better to allow a working airport sooner with less cumbersome need for every aspect.  It could start as a small airstrip that allows private planes into a small terminal with minimal or no need for baggage handling, a smaller and simpler fueling system, and just less stress of running baggage from checkin to the baggage bay and then back to a carousel (which you have to build yourself out of more conveyor belts).  \n\nThere is no \"growing\" experience in the game.  You don't get to discover things along the way.  Everything is sort of thrown at you in a sandbox fashion and you have to build and unlock everything right away just to get to the \"airport\" part of the sim.  \n\nIf the DEVS had spent time understanding how to \"build\" the anticipation of a true tycoon sim game this would be an awesome game, but it seems that everything is required or you have nothing... it's all or nothing sandbox.  It's boring after a couple of hours. And that brings my last point...\n\nA successful sim game is one that engages the player not just for a short time but for a long time with small rewards along the way, with finding what works and what doesn't, customizing things (floors and seat colors are about the only thing you can customize).  A good sim game allows the player's fun and anticipation to grow as the game grows.  AIRPORT CEO does none of that IMO.  \n\nLastly, I understand there is still work being done on the game and it is not fninshed.  I cannot imagine what else they could add to the game to keep my interest in playing it.  What additional items can be added to cusomize the airport or to grow it or make it vastly different.  I think most airports will end up looking pretty generic as there are limited items and ways to add pieces that make it work.  \n\nDue to it's very limited replayability - at this time based on what is available - and the fact that you have no growing curve in the true tycoon sim game style and have to build everything, I DO NOT recommend the game at this time.  Without a fully vetted sim \"growth\" the game is completed early on and just becomes repetitive.  I wish that the DEVs address what is planned in terms of making the game replayable such as:  procedurally generated terrain and starting points, ability to grow airports differently (without requiring all items at the beginning), some way to connect airports to other player created airports, more parts lilke glass walls, different types of restaurants or eating areas, etc.  \n\n", "votes_down": 43, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507000389, "timestamp_created": 1507000389, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 477, "steamid": "76561198007761167", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 92, "last_played": 1506995469, "playtime_forever": 477}, "votes_up": 68, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35279196", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527504", "review": "[h1]Review: Airport CEO for the PC.[/h1]\n[b]*Early Access Review*[/b]\n\nThis is somewhat cool. In fact, it's so cool that if you put this game in the kitchen people would start opening it up looking for a can of Coke or something. Why is this game the digital equivalent of an iceberg, you ask? Well, it's deep, it's smart and it's downright sexy, that's why.\n\nYou already know what to expect from Airport CEO I mean after all, it is an Airport simulation title. With the early access release there's some new stuff, some irratiting bugs have been ironed out, and now running your own little airport has never been better.\n\nAirport CEO tries to seperate itself from the pack with interesting and complex features. One of the great things about Airport CEO is that you get to make real choices along your way through the complex simulation. It really affects the game in a subtle, mature and nuanced way, like whether or not you end the game by going bankrupt and living with your parents and your angry pregnant wife.\n\nEmployees, Facilities & Buildings oh my! Airport CEO is beautifully complex. I mean airports are complex mega-structures anyway! It say's it right here on the back of the box! You have the control, currently in Early Access you have access to many of the normal facilities you would see at an airport; Control Towers, Aprons, Taxiways, Catering and fuel and much more. The employee system is also great. Sometimes you get tired of the old, his name is greg and he does things. Airport CEO goes into this a little more in-depth. From Airport Staff to Janitors, Ramp Works to mechanics. Employees interact with passengers, it's your duty to make sure you have skilled people managing and have stress resistance.\n\nPerformance is great and I haven't hit any points where I have hit a slow down in the simulation speed. I honestly can't wait to see what else Apoapsis Studios can do with Airport CEO.

I like the graphics, there a bit better done then prison architect and rimworld imo.\n\nThis said, after playing a few times and building a couple of airports, I am going to hold out and wait for some more patches before I get stuck in, I think it would be frustrating to build a huge complex airport currently and you would probably make it due ot bugs or strange ai behaviour.\n\nThis will be a good game of that I am sure.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506908898, "timestamp_created": 1506908898, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1214, "steamid": "76561197977786334", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 389, "last_played": 1506863541, "playtime_forever": 1214}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35391259", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508221", "review": "\nI will begin by saying. I loaded the game, and I didn't stop until 5 hours later, because I was hooked. Then I only stopped as it was 3am and my eye lids were closing.\n\nIt is truly what I was hoping for. Here's why,\n\n+ Real airport feel, weather, delays, flight board with status.\n+ Good scaling between vehicles, people, planes.\n+ Two levels of squares, finer for person sized objects, and larger for apron and road planning.\n+ Good level of content considering it is early early release.\n+ Tutorials even though it is early release.\n+ Not many bugs considering how early release.\n+ Customisable colours of objects, allowing colourful or grey airports, up to you.\n+ Enough systems and easy to place objects, but gives you plenty of freedom to design how you want.\n+ People in the airport already have needs, such as tiredness, toilet, hunger.\n+ Customisable road vehicles, not just air side!\n+ Great price.\n\nThe negatives. Honestly, none at this stage, as long as you realise it is a Beta early access, so will have bugs, and is limited in content.\n\nWorth buying yet. If you get it on first week sale and happy with early access sure.\nIf you want a full game, ready to challenge you, maybe wait until release, or closer to. But that's the same with all Early Access.\n\nThanks to the devs. Keep the good work up.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506880677, "timestamp_created": 1506880677, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 501, "steamid": "76561198005606830", "num_reviews": 19, "num_games_owned": 112, "last_played": 1506908816, "playtime_forever": 501}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35380997", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510895", "review": "Very impressed, not a huge amount of content and items yet, but trust me youll spend more time exploring options than worrying about them, that said it has a huge learing curve, the biggest i have every played. ive not put many hours in yet but it is slowly starting to click.
