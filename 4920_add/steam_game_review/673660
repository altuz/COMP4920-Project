They're abysmal.\nYou can work them out by practicing with wasd keys, but really they're a complete mess..\nBasically you have 15 different levels with '80s arcade-like graphics in which you are a green square and must work your way out by avoiding enemies running back and forth preset movement lines.\nThe bad thing is that wasd keys aren't for movement, but they're for the ice puzzles in Pok\u00e9mon (or Epic Battle Fantasy if you prefer): when you hit the directional key, you go.. you can't stop, and this makes everything or super difficult or super easy, depending on the level. You actually -could- stop by pressing space, but controls are so laggy and crappy that you will never stop in the right place.\nOn a further note, the game on my Italian Steam client/website has a translation which is the most horrible I ever saw - and they ask me why I play in English even if I don't like foreign languages..\nThe text goes \"\u00c8 necessario gestire il verde cubo e raggiungere un altro verde checkpoint. Ma \u00e8 molto difficile, cos\u00ec come il giocatore interferiscono con lame rotanti e altri ostacoli rosso colore.\"\nThat translates as: \"It is necessary to manage the cube green (sic) and reach an other (sic) checkpoint green. But it is very difficult, like the player (singular, sic) interact (plural, sic) with spinning blades (article is mandatory in Italian, sic) and other obstacles color red (sic)\".\nI want to meet the translator, he's my hero.\nAnyways back to the game, it's a simple (not for the difficulty but for the fact it has only few short levels and you can only move from one point to another one) and standard arcade game; there are tons of arcade platformers out there that easily overcome this thing.\nGet it only if you want the achievements, you'll find no fun at all.
