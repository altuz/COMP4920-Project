Especially when the Darkness is looking forward to you letting your guard down? And only thing ever kept you from falling into darkness was that Thing? Answer is very simple: Jackie Estacado.\n\nThink of a world, where you have nothing to live for... Think of a world that can't wait for its darkness... Think of a world you are the only one who keeps it away from its destruction... If so, set them on darkness. Devour everything, deny everything and destory anything that blocks your way. Nobody has the right and ability to question you.\n\nWhat about the enemies waiting for your revenge? They will have their turn to come. There are only two ends for those people who fucked with Jackie. One: A grave with one-piece corpse. Another one: Getting torn into pieces.\n\nThen what would you do if you were in Jackie's shoes? What would you do if you had the power to destory anything and take revenge? Would you show patience or understanding for your enemies? Or would you settle their hash?\n\nPlay this game, find out yourself. \n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507084468, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35461156", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198088309677", "num_reviews": 63, "last_played": 1507084069, "num_games_owned": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 359, "playtime_forever": 359}, "timestamp_updated": 1507084468, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Not sure if one should pay 30 bucks for this, but this is a very good game and i can recomend it to anybody who wants to rip people apart with tentacles..."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506681124, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35288867", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198162657551", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1498475710, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 345}, "timestamp_updated": 1506681124, "received_for_free": false, "review": "can we have The Darkness 3 please!"}]}
