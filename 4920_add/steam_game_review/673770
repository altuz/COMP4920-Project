With a twist as advertised, you get to test new feelings and potentially embrace your nostalgia. As a person who absolutely love cats, this game definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nMinutes into starting the first level, I was completely disappointed. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think you even play as a cat. The sprite you are controlling appears to be more like a mouse and the objective is to protect your base that has a white flag with a brown cat\u2019s face on it. I don\u2019t find cats to be the focus in this game.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is that the enemies you face are not cats. The enemies range from Wehrmacht soldiers look-a-likes to police cars. These are the same enemies you face for 30 straight levels. \n\nI find the game overall to be completely easy and boring. This game is not worth the price being sold here and not worth playing at all. \n\nI give this game one stars out of five. It killed a good 50 minutes that I had nothing better to spend the time on, but I don\u2019t recommend anyone else playing it. \n", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504581393, "timestamp_created": 1504581393, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198140949404", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 26, "last_played": 1504580196, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 21, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34965815", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492032", "review": "Shout at your friends, burn the kitchen down and have your food stolen by rats! 10/10", "votes_down": 11, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505458650, "timestamp_created": 1505458650, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198037796318", "num_reviews": 469, "num_games_owned": 6186, "last_played": 1505458611, "playtime_forever": 1341}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
