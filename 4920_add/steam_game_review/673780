So here we are. This is Arkanoid but its mad and full of urban gangsta flava. You could tell by the spray paint for the title and by the fact that you've just been robbed. Let's begin with the basics:\n\nYour paddle is a skateboard and you shoot this wobbling blue gonad at various boxes. The boxes range from slippers, a stick, a picture of Lucinda the crack whore, and a steel pipe(also known in the New York barrio as a Puerto Rican credit card), and a long metal beam. Most boxes need to be struck once to be destroyed. The metal beam is indestructible, the metal pipe requires 3 strikes, and Lucinda, like all crack whores, needs to be hit twice before she leaves you alone. As you destroy blocks, power-ups appear. They greatly help you to complete the game easier. They range from a protective barrier so you don't lose your gonad, to a lengthened skateboard. If you've played Arkanoid before you should know what to expect in the power-ups department as they are esentially similar.\n\nThe Positives: ( I have to do this doctor's orders )\nThere are various levels to play through with increasing difficulties. If you are an achievement whore, then lucky you because you get an achievement for pressing start...so yeah.\n\nThe Negatives:\nI get it this game isn't supposed to be taken seriously but it doesn't excuse the sloppy execution. First of all, physics...fuck it all. The gonad goes wherever it wants to. You may even try Arkanoid tactics to aim the descent of the gonad to the utmost tip to manipulate where it goes but it doesn't matter. Even while it is in motion the gonad will randomly just jerk to any random direction. Sometimes it will riccochet off of nothing. There have been times that I should've lost and the gonad bounced off the nothing and the gameplay resumed. The little obstacles that fly in like the elephants, the bum, the buyers remorse, sometimes it causes the game to stutter and crash. Its like playing a game of snake and the moment you eat your first apple your phone explodes. When I installed the game a desktop icon didn't even appear even though I requested it. I'm not blaming the game; I think my computer knew that this was an anus turkey and rebelled against it. The music...I'm sure that there is some person that'll enjoy this drug induced nightmare and sadly it is the only properly functioned feature of the whole game. UNfortuately, for me, it was okay at best and completely forgettable at worst.\n\nHave you ever played Bloody Boobs? Its exactly what you think it is and it costs a dollar. Its a crappy game trying to sell cheap sex appeal and thrilling gameplay that rivals trying to pick your underwear from the floor with your toes. While that game has been bashed to shit, I letigitmately have had a few hours of fun with the game getting drunk with friend, laughing, playing with the tits and trying to play that anal uppercut of a game. THIS game, on the other hand gave me no such joy AT ALL. I am not getting a refund for this game becuse I'm Catholic and when we fuck up, by religious law, we need to be punished. Having this game on my bank statement is my forty lashes. The only people this game could possibly be catering to are massochistic people looking for a good time and even then I would advise against it. Just slice your inner thighs a few times like a normal social media user and call it a night.\n\n* P.S. - I just noticed that this game supports English and Russian. Wow. First we draw pron of their mascot and now this! If they weren't pissed off at us before, they will be now.\n\n*P.P.S - Just throwing this out there...I played the game to absolute completion meaning I earned ALL the achievements.
