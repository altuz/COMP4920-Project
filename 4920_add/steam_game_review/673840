Don't expect a F1 simulator, this is a fun and fast arcade F1 racer with Vive-controller steering, easy to jump into but quite challenging to master! Check my Mixed Reality VR gameplay I made showing all 3 cars and 4 tracks in action:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VH9E4Vl1h8\n\nThe good stuff about FormulaVR:\n\nGraphics are very good, image is sharp on distance (even without supersampling) and car models are very polished, including the cockpit.\n\nSimple but logic main menu, and you can adjust your seating position any time easily with grip button (very good).\n\nSteering with Vive controllers works great actually, but of course its an arcade game so the sensitivity is quite low. Its easy to steer and I dont miss steering wheel support tbh. Good arcade feeling!\n\nOpponents are challenging and AI is not bad at all. Sense of speed is awesome in 300km/h and no motion sickness for me at all. Good sound effects and awesome arcade immersion! Tutorial is available. Full Mixed Reality support is nice as well :) (thank you SAT BOX). Price is resonable as well (I bought it myself), and performance is good.\n\nThe less good stuff about FormulaVR:\n\nNo Multiplayer (yet at least)\nOnly 4 tracks and 3 cars available.\nOnly qualify+race mode. No warm up and no career or championship modes.\nSome of the tracks are better looking than others, at least one of them is actually taken straight from VR Sports Go Kart game (same developer).\nMusic is mostly from VR Sports (not bad though)\nNo difficulty settings (as far as I can see)\nNo car or tire adjustments/customizations.\nNo car damage on crash.\nNo weather conditions except sunny.\n\nAll in all, very simple but still very fun and good looking F1 racing game. Just jump into it, have fun and enjoy arcade-ish F1 races in Virtual Reality. Check my full gameplay video above for more info and my final thoughts.\n\nCheers guys!\nSweViver\n", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503336410, "timestamp_created": 1503336410, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198164837178", "num_reviews": 70, "num_games_owned": 213, "last_played": 1503232937, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34398125", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "review": "So much fun.
