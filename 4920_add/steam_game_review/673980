Glad I did, as I actually enjoy the game.\nYou can tell this game borrows game play mechanics heavily from the NES game: \"Ghosts 'n Goblins.\"  Even the name bears a resemblance.\n\nThe art style is pretty cool (reminds me of the dupes from \"Oxygen Not Included) sound track is good, and the controls are responsive.  I was able to use an Xbox controller on my PC, so that's a plus as well.  I did not encounter any glitches of any kind while playing. \n\nGame play is fairly simplistic; with your main goal being to navigate across the levels and get to end, where you fight an end stage boss.  As you fight across the levels, there are various weapons which you can use: from throwing knives, to lobbing bombs, to melee spears.  You start out wearing a suit of armor, and when you get hit, the armor will break.  Get hit again and you're dead.  \n\nFrom what I can tell at this time, the story is about a girl trying to save her lover from some type of ghoulish captor.  Perhaps a reverse homage to Ghosts 'n Goblins plot.  \n\nAnyways, the game is pretty good.  If you're a fan of the genre, then I absolutely believe it is worth $4.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502149584, "timestamp_created": 1502149584, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197984712587", "num_reviews": 76, "num_games_owned": 168, "last_played": 1502169641, "playtime_forever": 239}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34091284", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495624", "review": "This game obviously isn't some big AAA title, but it's certainly not a bad game.
