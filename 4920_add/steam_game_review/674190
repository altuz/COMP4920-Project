You establish and manage colonies, there's a good combat minigame, and a huge amount of depth.\n\nYou start with explorers and a small army to explorer the new world. A few turns later your colonist arrives and you find a place for a colony. You gradually develop it and later start other colonies. \n\nYour mothercountry asks for increasing amounts of tax over time, so you will eventually want to declare independence and fight off it's armies.\n\nYou can fight other European settlers or the natives for land to start other colonies. You can also trade with them instead. Interestingly, you can play as a native tribe and try to federate other native settlements.\n\nI love it as you can set the number of turns to be unlimited and just play as an open-ended sandbox game. It has good replayability as it has a random map generator. Also, each country has individual bonuses and you can also pick skills too.\n\nEg I am currently playing as Holland who earn interest on their gold (I cannot remember their other bonuses) and one of the skills I picked was the \"missionary\" skill, so my relationship with nearby natives increases over time. (They wiped out the first army to find them but are now friendly).\n\nThe PDF manual is included in the \"Local files\" for the game, and shows the countries' bonuses. The in-game explanation of these bonuses is non-existent as this game was released back in the era when gamers read manuals. There's also a detailed guide online by \"SMcInerney\" which is easy to google and worth a read.\n\nThe two main game features are:\n\n1) Colony development.\nA bit like the Anno series. You place buildings down, you accumulate resources, upgrade the colony and it's buildings from levels 1 to 4.\n\nThere's a large element of micromanagement as you plan what resources you will need. However,  there are only 5 resources so it's not too bad. (wood, metal, food, goods and gold). You generally harvest the first 3, make the 4th, and earn the 5th by trading.\n\nEach colony can be totally self-sufficient but you'll generally want to specialise them a bit to take advantage of nearby terrain bonuses.\n\nTerrain gives bonuses to the production of buildings within colonies, and you can specialise colonies for more bonuses (to food, wood or metal). You can trade resources between colonies but you don't need to load it onto a ship like Colonisation. You just create the trade, and they arrive a turn or more turns later.\n\nA colony's population is a number, eg 100. It grows by a fixed % each turn and you can build churches to attract more. Buildings have labour requirements, and units have a pop cost too.\n\nIt's very satisfying to gradually grow your colonies. You won't have many so you won't drown in micromanagement hell. Eg in my current game I have just 2, and I'll eventually declare independence with just these once they're fully developed. Then I'll see whether to continue to expand/fight or restart as another country.\n\n2) Combat\nOnce you build a fort in cities, you can recruit armies. These cost population and resources. Upgrading your colonies allows better armies (they have more hitpoints),\n\nArmies are led by leaders, who gain experience over time. This is spent on allowing them to control more units, increases the number of units who can attack each turn, movement speed, etc.\n\nThe combat minigame is really well thought out. This is unique as combat in other turn-based games gets too tedious with large armies, or too simplified where you give high-level orders and watch cinematics.\n\nYou make meaningful choices about positioning and movement, as you get strong flanking bonuses and can also win by reaching the enemy flag. You also make meaningful choices about which units to attack with, as you have a limited number of attacks per turn (based on the army leader's abilities). Even with large armies, the constraints of the minigame mean that combat is never overwhelming.\n\nCombat occurs when armies attack each other but you also get natives raiding your colonies.\n\nOther features:\n- research = spend gold to get various bonuses\n- map has \"nodes\" that give bonuses to buildings within a certain radius, IF you control it. So there's a reason to station armies around your colonies, not just within it.\n- maintenance of armies: number of units is capped, based on number of forts and their level of upgrade. These buildings take up space and labour in your colonies so there's a trade-off between large armies and your economy.\n- you get militia units when defending your colonies but each hit they take will reduce your population\n\nTechnical note:\nThis is the Deluxe Edition, which is has the patches on the original game up to v1.12. So don't think it's version 1.0 with no patches.\n\nIn case you're wondering whether an old game like this would work on modern PCs, don't worry. This release on steam works fine. No crashes or bugs.\n\nAlt-tabbing causes issues, as the resolution of the screen switches back to your normal resolution, which means instead of being full-screen, the game now only takes up a fraction of it (eg 10-20%). You can press alt-enter to make it full screen again (thanks Jack).", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501618928, "timestamp_created": 1500734184, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019599257", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 98, "last_played": 1501883198, "playtime_forever": 747}, "votes_up": 37, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
