I've also unlocked most of the achievements (I've played plenty of 2048). I like having a good version of the game to play on Steam but let me give some criticism and suggestions...\n\n\nEDIT - The Dev has continued to update the game to get many things added or fixed. ALL OF THE # ITEMS BELOW HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED.\n\n1. The \"Modern\" mode is at an odd angle and lacks actual numbers to see your progess easily. You're going off visual 3-D bars that have similar colors at the higher numbers. Honestly, this mode hurt the hell out of my eyes after a while. Either add some numbers or change the colors drastically between numbers.\n\n2. Add a dark theme to the classic 4x4 and 8x8 modes\n\n3. The screenshot button with Steam (F12) does not appear to work with this game\n\n4. Add an option to play without the undo button on Classic mode and have seperate leaderboards for those modes. The undo button is like playing the game on easy mode. ;)\n\n5. Allow us to use the directional pad on a controller. I'm currently using the arrow keys on a keyboard because the analog stick is too easy to accidently make a mistake.\n\n7. $1.99 isn't much to ask but .99 would be better. You can play this game MANY places for free so need to add more features and options if you're going to ask for $1.99. If you can do a lot of the requests that might be asked, I'd glady say $1.99 is more than fair.__EDIT__ This game is worth $1.99.\n\n\n\nEDIT - Dev continues to update the game! Great work.\n\nHe added Survival mode, Time Trials, and Unmistakable (which is what item #4 above was asking for).\n\nThe only outstanding item from my list was a wish for trading cards. This will be up to Valve to allow and really isn't a big deal.\n\n6. Trading cards with badges would be nice. Badges could be numbers going up to 2048. 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and then 2048 as the foil badge maybe? Or start with 128 and hit 2048 on fifth badge with foil being a 2048 with cool difference.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505704571, "timestamp_created": 1503980705, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "steamid": "76561197970559795", "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 1159, "last_played": 1506478029, "playtime_forever": 686}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34642645", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "A pretty fun 2048 game.
