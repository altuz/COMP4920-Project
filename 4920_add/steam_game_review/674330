In between rounds, you only have four (later six) eggbirds to build, upgrade, or gain extra resources. While you can undo immediate actions, you cannot sell or move towers later.\n\nDuring a round, your only action is to temporarily power up towers, then wait a few seconds for the recharge. This might sound limited, but especially in later levels, it keeps you busy with quickly deciding when and on which tower to use your power best.\n\nThe maps are very open, giving you many different options to figure out the best set up by replaying a level.\n\nThe art style is not for me, personally, but also doesn't turn me off.\n\nOverall, the game is all about strategy and planning ahead, which can make it frustrating at first, but more enjoyable on replays. As a fan of strategy and tower defense games, I love it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505680581, "timestamp_created": 1505680581, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 524, "steamid": "76561198079986918", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 32, "last_played": 1507155726, "playtime_forever": 1000}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34975274", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501670", "review": "I just finished my first playthrough of Defend the Cake's 18 levels, and I am very excited to go back and play through all the levels again. \nThis is certainly one of the best tower defense games I have ever played, and is on par with Kingdom Rush and Plants vs Zombies. \nDefend the Cake is relatively easy to beat if you don't care if some of your cake is taken by ants or rocket powered snails, but difficult if you're trying to get a perfect score. \nThe aspect of Defend the Cake that distinguishes it from other tower defense games is that all 6 towers have their own purpose and no single tower feels overpowered. \nI highly recommend purchasing this game if your're a fan of strategy tower defense games.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505490890, "timestamp_created": 1505490890, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 662, "steamid": "76561198094081016", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 31, "last_played": 1507176254, "playtime_forever": 2348}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34981216", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499429", "review": "Cute and fun tower defense game.
