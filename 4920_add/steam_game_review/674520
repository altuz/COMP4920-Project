The influences are evident - Street fighter, Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, Battletoads, Final Fight - the sole programmer seemingly combed through every game you could conceivably call a \"beat em up\" from the 90s, and cherry picked some of the best elements from each. Better yet, he managed to wrangle a surprising amount of depth out of it without having to resort to a \"lane\" system, or requiring you to press a button to toggle which direction you're looking, like some other games in the genre have leaned on in order to shoehorn more fighting-game-style inputs in.\n\nThe presentation is top notch. From the moment you launch it, the CRT filter and arcade cabinet overlay make it clear exactly what kind of game you're getting in to. The musician that was hired gets his own intro, and it's off to the games title screen proper, and you're greeted by the games logo as a tune practically plucked straight out of Guilty Gear blares in the background. Pressing start brings up a neat menu, making it immediately obvious that this game has plenty of secrets to unearth.\n\nMy first foray into the game was by myself, and the pre-game tutorial (which is very arcade appropriate, by the way) tells you just enough to get you going. In the path that I decided to take, new enemy types were slowly introduced, usually by themselves or in pairs, to give you time to figure out how to defeat them. Once you've had some time to practice against them, they start coming in greater numbers, or combined with other enemy types, to create a mental challenge that demands you keep track of all of them. They all telegraph their attacks, but it's up to you to make sure that you can either get out of the way, or throw something into them before they connect with you.\n\nThe game is quite challenging, even on Normal. I found myself falling into button-mashing habits very early on, and got a game over on stage 2. Determined not to credit feed this game, I let the timer run out and gave it another go from stage 1. Everything I'd learned up to that gameover point, and a new-found level of caution got me up to the 6th stage before running out of Steam again. It wasn't until I parked my wife next to me and we played together that we were able to defeat the final boss, using a single continue. After seeing one ending, the game unlocks a new menu item that shows you exactly how much \"progress\" you've made. I won't spoil it for you here, but suffice to say, the game has plenty of replayability.\n\nSince this game is rooted deeply in the days of old, where you buy a game and you own it, and extras are something you unlock and not just fork money over for, there's plenty for you to unlock. Alternate costumes, new colors for any costumes you already have, new playable characters, new modes, and more. Scoring points in Arcade mode and beating the game or getting a game over converts those points into coins, a currency used to unlock things in the extras shop. With the rate that you earn coins, and the number of branching paths available to you, there's plenty of incentive to play the game again and again, including higher difficulty modes that present more of a challenge as you gradually figure out the combo system and how to deal with the enemies. \n\nIf I have any major gripes, it's the absence of online play, and lack of a manual. Only being able to share this experience with local friends is not entirely out of place for the 90s arcade atmosphere the game is promoting very thoroughly, but as a modern title, it's moderately disappointing that I can't share it with my online friends too. I'd also have liked to have some sort of documentation that explains how to pull off the extra moves and combos that, occasionally, I'd pull off entirely by accident. Perhaps this is revealed to you later with the \"tips\" system available in the Extras shop? Still, after having played through once and having familiarized myself with the controls and how to effectively use the one \"combo\" they teach you, I wanted to know more, and was prepared to read for it. Perhaps they're taught to you in the training mode, which is something else you can buy in the Extras shop...but I'm not yet certain, as I haven't bought that extra yet.\n\nThe controls are tight, the overall presentation package is superb, and the length of the game is just about right to casually whip this game out in front of a friend, sibling, or partner and force them to play it with you. Some may protest the price tag, but I think it's a silly notion to expect a game with this much content on offer to be any cheaper than it is.

The stage tiles are given life by a healthy mix of colors with good shading techniques, detailed background and foregrounds (The foregrounds are just on screen enough to give detail, but not enough to block the screen. I love it.) with animated effects such as raging fires, or down pouring rain with ripple effects, that all come together without making it difficult to navigate the screen.\n\nEnemy and character design follows suit, I've yet to ever lose myself or the enemy on the screen, even when there's a ton of stuff going on. On that note, lets talk about gameplay.\n\nThe game will give you a short, brief little tutorial on the controls at your disposal, how to walk, inputting a directional button twice for a dash or a dodge, and your jump, attack, and super button. As you progress through the stages you'll beat up some dudes and earn points that'll turn into coins you can spend on new characters, costumes, and other cool stuffs.\n\nReal quick note, first thing I strongly advise anyone gets it's the training mode. There's some hidden depth behind all of the characters movesets and this will take you through them all (as far as I know thusfar)\nThe game is challenging without feeling entirely unfair (though it looks like Ricardo has a tougher time on his own given that he doesn't have a dash/dodge) by yourself, and is a blast with a friend or two. \n\nGetting through to the end will take practice, this isn't just a smash attack to win styled beat 'em up.  learning how the various enemies and their AI's function, and most importantly who to prioritize when, and how you can string your combo's together in combination with dashes/dodges, jumps and kicks to avoid damage. (You can jump again when ever your character is above an enemy sprite! There is no limit far as I can tell on how many times you can do this.) \n\nBig thing to note, you have a decent amount of delay time you can make use of between each attack, sometimes hitting one guy as fast and hard as possible isn't the best play at your disposal, but rather drawing a hit string out so that you can get the really dangerous guys into the combo, worst comes to worst, dodge, or super out of it if things look iffy.\n\nThe various different paths are a nice touch I feel, some good examples that come to mind, in one of the stages (on a diversion from the standard path already) you have the choice to either escape upwards down a path, or to continue on facing a seemingly endless horde of enemies. Or, in the first stage, you can flee the burning town to the left just like the rest of the townsfolk are doing. And the final example, for saving a hostages life, before the boss can do them in.\n\nNow, real quickly. I'd like to go over some stuff that would be nice quality of life improvements. If you could map a button to be a context action for dash/dodge, so for example, I use a playstation controller. X is super, O is jump, Triangle is attack, I'd love it if I could map it so that I could press, or hold square, and tap any directional button to trigger it's respective dash or dodge. Just something that would take some pain off my left hand and make the gameplay feel a little less frantic.\n\nSecond thing that would be nice, and might already be in the game, I don't know. (as of yet, I have not beaten the game on normal, just so you know.) It'd be awesome if there was a way to see a roadmap of the stages you've seen, and the possible exits within them, and how many of them you've seen.\nAgain, these aren't stuff that are needed, just feel like it would improve the game a little.\n\nAll in all, I put this right up there with Double Dragon Neon for one of my favorite beat 'em up games and hope to see more from SebaGames! Please keep up the fantastic work!\n\nEdit: Stage 8 is made of nightmares and hopelessness. my hands know only pain. But I won't let this beat me. may want to throw in just one more food drop at some point in that stage, also might want to include a save at level start/check point feature for those of us with hand issues, so we can take a break and come back later when the pain has died down.\nA boss with super armor, in a tiny room, surrounded by mooks, that he wont hit, might not be the best idea.\nof the main three cast, Gal feels to be the weakest of the three with few ways to deal with enemies with super armor, she can't throw the larger enemies (which, is fair. she's the smallest, least muscular of the three.) but she I can't help but feel she needs something that'll let her break through armored enemies.

This game nails every aspect of a good beat-em-up game.  If you're a fan or a newcomer to the genre, this game is a must buy.\n\nThe combat mechanics are perfect, even though there are only 3 buttons to press, there is surprisingly a good amount of combos that you can pull off.  Also the combat feels very satisfying, every attack has a lot of weight behind it which in turns makes it very satisfying to punch enemies.\n\nThe stage design is fairly simple with multiple branching paths that you can take.\n\nMusic is excellent.  I'm don't really care for music in video games, but the soundtrack in this game sticks out a lot to me in a good way.  It has the \"pumped up\" feeling which makes you want to go berserk and destroy everything in the game.\n\nThere are many unlockables in the game, such as skins, which gives it a very high replay value.\n\nOverall I am very satisfied with the game, this is definitely one of the best beat-em-ups I have played in a very long time.  The price is a little high, but you will definitely get your moneys worth and much more.  Definitely do put it at the top of your wishlist and wait for a sale, you really do not want to miss out on this game.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506028512, "timestamp_created": 1506028207, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 529, "steamid": "76561198040837514", "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 476, "last_played": 1506659752, "playtime_forever": 529}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35075687", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503051", "review": "Best beat 'em up in decades and top 10 GOTY candidate for my personal taste.

You'll collect coins and unlock all kinds of stuff. Music is all right too, personally I didn't find it to be that memorable, but maybe that's just because I don't listen that much metal. Most of the time the game has a great \"game feel\", you really feel the power of those attacks. As far as I understand, the entire game was made by one person (not counting the music), so the work is very impressive and clearly a lot of effort went into making this game.\n\nThere's just one thing that I don't agree with. The game goes for that arcade experience and you can't save the game between levels. You have to beat the entire game in one sitting, and I am not a huge fan of that. The game is quite short, but I could imagine it can still be too long for some people to finish in one session. The game is very much fast non-stop action and it may get a little exhausting to play it all at once. And I haven't even mentioned that the game throws huge amounts of enemies at you as you make progress, and it won't be easy for those playing in single player mode (in normal mode, at least). I haven't played in multiplayer, but at least I'd think this problem isn't that bad when playing with a friend or two.\n\nI can understand that this is how it was in other retro arcade games back in the day, but I don't see how having the option to save would hurt the game. After all, the game already has infinite continues, so it's not like saving would make finishing the game any easier. The only problem might be that save scumming could be used to cheat and get more coins than you should, but even that could be easily fixed by having it so that saving always resets your score to zero. Naturally this save feature would be completely optional and purists could disable it. Well, this all is just a suggestion. I'm just saying that the lack of saving effectively prevents Fight N' Rage from being a pick up and play -kinda game for shorter sessions. (if you don't wanna play the first levels again, that is)\n\nThat aside, there's a pretty good training mode that will help you to learn the moves and combos. Every character plays differently and it's fun to learn them. Weirdly enough, you start with normal and hard difficulty modes, but easy mode is something you have to unlock by collectiong coins (maybe this was done to encourage people to not play on easy so that their skills would improve more?). I very much recommend all new players to unlock the easy mode as soon as possible and then finish the game once with it, and then try the other difficulty modes after you get better.\n\nStill, very much recommended for all fans of the genre, I've had a lot of fun with this game.\n\n+ Fun gameplay and \"game feel\"\n+ Responsive controls\n+ Three main characters play differently\n+ Great pixel art visuals\n+ Different routes and endings that give it more replay value\n+ Generally it's a well polished game\n- No saving between levels, requires you to finish it in one session\n- Some unlocks require you to finish the game in harder difficulties, that may be really hard for some players\n- I would have liked to see just a few more special moves per character, or even more playable story characters (to be honest this may be unreasonable, as this game must have already been a lot of work for one developer)", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506020476, "timestamp_created": 1505930377, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 817, "steamid": "76561197983732894", "num_reviews": 51, "num_games_owned": 151, "last_played": 1506713474, "playtime_forever": 915}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35099280", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502898", "review": "The game is awesome and worth every cent.  This creative dev brought all of the goodies of yesteryear and translated them into a modern package.  The gameplay is outstanding, art is picturesque, and replayability is cranked to the max.\n\nJust to touch on an example of thinking outside of the box when merging old with new, Fight'N Rage has a very unique take on how specials are performed.  When performing specials you have a special meter that builds up and allows you to do them with out an impact on your health bar, but if you can't wait for your special to build then your health meter will take a hit.  Your character can parry, jump attack, and flatout pulverize enemies.  The moves are flashy, plentiful, and sound great.  \n\nOther reviews go more in depth of the highlights of this 2017 take on beat'em ups of my childhood, I'm just here to co-sign on what the other positive reviewers have already said.
