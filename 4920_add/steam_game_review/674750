It's an updated version of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/270550/]this game[/url].[/b]\n\nSince Microsoft XNA got dumped, so did the devs of original [i]YAZD[/i] dump it and adapt [i]Unity[/i]. Hence, this remastered game. I'm going for comparisons review - if you wish to read my comprehensive review of the old game (going a bit more into detail), [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/270550]it's here[/url].\n\n[h1]What's new?[/h1]\n\nThe game was built from ground up on [i]Unity[/i] but it has all the same features of old [i]YAZD[/i] and slightly more:\n\n[list]\n[*][b]New enemy types[/b]\n[*](in regards to above) [b]Lot more challenging Survival mode[/b]\n[*]One new [b]character model[/b]\n[*][b]Workshop support[/b] (promised but pending)\n[*]Slightly better graphics\n[*]A couple of more new amusing, challenging [b]achievements[/b] to hunt\n[/list]\n\nIt frankly isn't much. It wasn't free upgrade either, but devs were kind enough to give out -75% coupons for previous purchasers.\n\nMost exciting of the above were the new enemy types. The new enemies, like ghouls and hellhounds really freaked me up the first time they appeared, which is cool.\n\nModding (through Steam Workshop) might make it all the more exciting but it's not in the game yet, as of writing.\n\n[h1]What's old?[/h1]\n\nOtherwise [i]YAZD HD[/i] is the same fine top-down tactics shooter / defender as before but more challenging. Zombies get tougher faster, and new enemy types are really just alternative models with different (usually larger) health, damage and speed.\n\nCo-op has been reworked, allowing three different modes of money-spending in the Survival mode. In [i]YAZD[/i] only host could buy stuff, but this can be altered in the HD version.\n\nThe new challenge rating shows adequately: I beat the original [i]YAZD[/i] achievements in 2.5 hours, while it took me over 5 hours to do the same in the HD remake right after seasoning myself in the original.\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\n[i]YAZD HD[/i] is still a good game. If you didn't play the original one, you should get this HD version instead, even if it's a bit pricier.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506295198, "timestamp_created": 1506294891, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001046455", "num_reviews": 135, "num_games_owned": 7088, "last_played": 1504647030, "playtime_forever": 310}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34841580", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515233", "review": "Really good game.
