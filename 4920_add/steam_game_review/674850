Played for 5.6 hours on the first day alone, it is that addicting. The throwing mechanics are nearly spot on, once you get the hang of it you can really dial in some surprisingly accurate throws. The difficulty ramps up very nicely, starting with a defense that is relatively easy to pick apart and moving up from there. By about round 3, it becomes extremely challenging (which is a good thing). \n\nThe play creation is very intuitive, allowing you to draw up your own plays adds a ton of depth to the game and makes replay-ability much higher than only having a premade set of plays. It is addicting planning out each of your routes and strategizing what situations you will design plays for (ie. 2nd and short vs 3rd and long specific route combinations). It's also interesting as you'll find that each defense in each round will use different schemes. For example I've noticed that one defense will play press coverage on receivers while another plays further off. This, again, makes you strategize even more as certain plays you make will work flawlessly against one defense, and will not work at all against another. The only downside with the play system as of now is that there are only 4 play slots allowed, but the developers are very responsive and have indicated that they will be adding 4 more soon which is even more awesome.\n\nAll in all, this game is an absolute steal for the amount of replay value here. Let's put it this way, I've never reviewed a game on steam before but I felt compelled to praise this game. It is that good. The only thing stopping me from playing more is going to work and my arm being shockingly tired from throwing corner endzone touchdowns.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506611750, "timestamp_created": 1506611750, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 675, "steamid": "76561198045546101", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 79, "last_played": 1506912409, "playtime_forever": 675}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35225760", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500681", "review": "I do recommend this game.  I think it is priced appropriately for what you're getting.  However, you should lower your expecations on what you're getting.  This is not a football simulator or QB simulator.  [u]This is arcade football where you're not reading defenses as much as you're just throwing it to the open man/ covered man as accurately as possible and with correct timing to score as many points as possible to get on the leaderboards.  [/u]\n\nYou do have to make quick decisions on whether you're intended receiver is able to catch a ball.  Obviously, if you throw it very accurately and on time, it may not matter that the receiver is covered.  You may want to avoid double coverages.  If you see a receiver open, you don't have to be as accurate, however, throwing it accurately and on time will probably result in a touchdown.  You can keep running the same play over and over again.  Feel free to change plays but I found one play where usually at least one receiver was open. You are constantly running a 2 minute offense and there's really no need to ever run the ball (unless you want a change of pace).  Also, your arm will probably be tired after more than a few rounds.  Obviously, the graphics are not the best and there's really only a few customization options, including making your own plays.\n\nAfter you score a touchdown is where the real points challenge come.  You have to throw the football through the hoops and if possible into the hands of receivers to get max points.  This is where you'll climb to the top of leaderboards.  \n\nDid I have fun?  Hell yeah, it seems like you can draw defenders into covering by looking at your receiver right away or by successfully throwing to a receiver once or twice.  It feels good to anticipate a throw and hit the receiver in stride. So you learn to look off defenders and then throw accurate throws on time.  That will take practice.  You do need a bit more than standing room to get the marker in the tutorial.  But other than that, you can play with just standing room.\n\nRating 7/10 good fun for the price", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506445289, "timestamp_created": 1506445185, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 97, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1506661373, "playtime_forever": 97}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35233442", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Really fun game.

I love how I can feel what it's like to have a pass rush coming at me while I'm having to look off defenders to find an open reciever all within a few seconds. I love how I can design my own routes or have players block for my offense. This game has quickly become one of the few games I've gone back to several times to play and I plan to play it more.\n\nI wish there were a few things that were different. Such as I wish the 4 plays that you get to design before you start your attempt to win it all were able to be adjusted/redesigned either during the game or at least inbetween games after a win. Maybe timeouts can be used to create different plays during the games. I wish there were more plays to choose from, maybe 8 plays or even more. 4 just seems so limited in choices even for a 2 minute drill attempt, especially when the defense seems to learn what you do. I wish the offensive players would not get stuck on eachother when running routes. They need to learn how to run around eachother or something. I wish I could skip thru the final celebration after losing a game, it was fun the first couple times, but now I just wanna skip thru and start over right away and not wait a min or 2 (thats what it feels like) after a loss to try again. Of course, I wish it was way more expanded, such as a full length game, being able to play defense, and more control over all the players when designing plays as well as players having attributes and abilities, like more speed for the WR and more blocking for the TE instead of everyone seeming like they're the same.\n\nBut I am really stoked for one of the earliest football iterations that has come out for VR and I hope it will continue down a path using this as a foundation for what it can become. Thanks for making this game Truant Pixel team!\n\nEdit: I saw right after writing this that there was an update earlier in the day making 8 plays choices possible. But another idea to double that play count is to add a swap sides button so each play can be flipped to the other side of the field.
