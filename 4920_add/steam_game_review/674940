I think I saw the trailer for it because I had the april fools day Totally Accurate Battle Zombilator or something like that. And, I'm gonna rate it just like all of my other reviews! 1 to 10 scale!\n\nGraphics: 9/10: The graphics in this game are crisp and smooth. Though, explosions aren't quite optimized, and i'd love to see some sort of extra distinguishing marks like maybe hats or something similar added later. And certainly a Colorblind Mode for those gamers who can't see certain colors!\n\nAudio: 10/10: The Music and Sounds for this game are a mix of funky techno and awesome gunshot noises. Though I'd have loved to hear an AWP noise from CS:GO for the Sniper Rifle.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10: I will certainly get hundreds of hours out of this with friends. The gameplay is like an older PS3 game a friend had where you could Twin Stick and you had a Punch, Kick, and Energy button setup. And there were random weapons that would spawn. I would like the ability to go into a Training Room with each of the weapons to learn how they play, and some sort of Health Meter would be nice, but not required. \n\nMaps: 9/10: The maps are great and fun to play, But i'd love to see some sort of Map Creator linked to the Steam Workshop Mods system. This would help to keep the game alive unlike other similar and still fun Indie titles like Screencheat, where the game is great, but the small map pool killed the game's potential to purely a few hours and then moving on with my life. \n\nOverall: 9/10: People might say that I am being harsh on a brand new Indie title, but these are valid criticisms, and I do only have a few minutes into the game at the time of this review, but I will certainly be racking up the hours as the weeks go by and I need something to put my frustrations into! I highly recommend this game as a fun Party game.

So far, the gameplay is similar to Duck Game, where you jump around killing your friends with whatever you can get your hands on.

The demo video above is a very accurate representation of how the game plays, and is 100% worth it for the price listed. I've only played with my friends online, but for the people without friends, there was the option to play online with randoms.

Obama had just been elected, Breaking Benjamin were on tour, and every other YouTube video was a stick fight animation using their music. If you don't remember, proceed with caution- you may just cut yourself on all of that edge. For a safer (and arguably more fun) physics based experience, play Stick Fight: The Game.\n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Ingenious in it's simplicity\n[*]Procedural animations lend to the experience fluidity\n[*]Badass movements\n[*]Chaotic gameplay\n[*]Local Multiplayer \n[*]Huge map variety\n[*]Solid weapon variety\n[*]Good performance on my mid-range laptop\n[*]Gamepad, Controller, and K/M support, and all of them feel great\n[*]Fair, if not generous price point\n[*]Kickass score\n[*]Works with Hamachi, if that's your thing\n[*]Devs seem to be listening to the community already- off to a good start\n[*]Looks REALLY good- the colours, effects, animations, etc. are all very well made\n[/list]\n[h1] Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The settings don't always seem to work very well\n[*]Very new- it may be difficult to find online players\n[*]No singleplayer AI\n[*]A couple of the maps are broken (everyone just shoots into the abyss on spawn)\n[*]Combat could be a bit more fluid- sometimes it feels clunky\n[*]UI seems to lag a bit\n[/list]\n[h1]Things Which Could Go Either Way[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Perhaps overly simple- no acheivements, no map selection, no workshop\n[*]No server system\n[*]VERY rough multiplayer- a lot of people are having issues with matchmaking. Try Hamachi, or similar services- just make sure you turn that shit off before you play KSP.\n[*]Gameplay can get repetitive after you play it for a few hours. That said, I was compelled to play it for a few hours just outside of the box.\n[/list]\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nWhen it works, it's awesome. This game is very well made, and very fun to play. There are a few kinks, but the developers are alreay working on ironing those out- and it's been out for less than a week at the time of writing. For five dollars, there's really no reason not to buy it. Hell- buy a few copies for your friends.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nMy friend Katie's laughter and my screams of \"JESUS CHRIST JESUS CHRIST THE SNAKES ARE INSIDE ME CHRIST\" scored me a noise complaint, and someone next door who hadn't even seen any gameplay purchased it immediately.", "votes_down": 12, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506869989, "timestamp_created": 1506869732, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 279, "steamid": "76561198054790221", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 230, "last_played": 1507134626, "playtime_forever": 279}, "votes_up": 44, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35340434", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548421", "review": "[u][h1] Stick Fight: The Game [/h1][/u]\nStick Fight intrigued me. I had been a follower of Landfall's previous games and projects. They had a unique, simplistic art style fitted with a bundle of content. And when I saw this in my email one day at school, I knew I [i]had[/i] to buy it. Me and my friend both loved stick animation since we were as young as 9, and we love party games.\n[b]So, what about the game itself?[/b]\n[u][h1] Pros \u2713 [/h1][/u]\n[b][u]The gameplay: [/u][/b]\nThe gameplay is one of my favourite aspects. Being Landfall, they are bound to have satisfyingly floppy animations, and they deliver. Backflips, frontflips, diving, Naruto running, and so much more is available to do in the world. Me and my friend even RP as different people from different countries thanks to the wide variety of guns and environments. Even though the fighting commences in a closed box, it is the perfect amount of space needed for long range, medium range and melee battling to take place.\n[b][u] Graphics [/u][/b]\nNot much is to really be said here, one graphics option on a dropdown menu and resolution options. I play at a low resolution, and it's good to know they optimised it well, just like T.A.B.S. It's kind of a shame they didn't allow for particle options, however, as one of the laser levels cuts my framerate to pieces.\n[b][u] Servers [/u][/b]\nThe servers are, for the most part, consistent and steady. However, I would like for there to be more options. I won't babble on too much about this, because the game is only 2 days old, but there is only one mode. Deathmatch. I would like a variety of modes like being able to team up with friends, a gamemode similar to the conveyor belt box level, where you jump and evade boxes or lasers while running. However, the game is only two days old, as I've mentioned. It's subject to development, and they have a huge update coming soon.\n[b][u] Developers [/u][/b]\nA little side note here, the developers do not have this as their main priority at the moment. It is currently T.A.B.S, and this game is what they have done in their free time. So, if there are no updates for a few months, it's nothing to rally on about. Just be patient and they'll give updates and more content further on.\n[b][u] Music [/u][/b]\nI really like the music in this game. It fits the tone of messy brawls and speedy jolts, but the music does repeat itself over the course of time, and you will hear the same tune played again after a while. My friend likes to play this game with no music but rather the punching audio, maybe you'll do the same.\n[u][h1] Cons \u2717 [/h1][/u]\nWell, this is going to sound rather preachy, but there are basically no major cons that I can give to the game. Two minor ones I have previously mentioned are the graphics limitations and servers sometimes lagging a tad, but there's basically nothing bad about this game. Maybe the price is something to go against, but a game is a game.\n[u][h1] TL:DR [/h1][/u]\nThis game is utterly fantastic. I recommend buying this game if you need something to play with friends, love fast-paced action or brutal beatdowns. This game does remind me of Gang Beasts, a game I have reviewed negatively in the past, but this is the Gang Beasts everyone wanted. Laughs, beatdowns and difficulty.\nThis is a great game to have in your library. Over the course of some updates, you might find yourself crawling back to it.\nHave fun!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506782572, "timestamp_created": 1506782231, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 672, "steamid": "76561198207598432", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 114, "last_played": 1506979277, "playtime_forever": 672}, "votes_up": 24, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35277308", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543545", "review": "This game is so amazing it made me write my first review", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506644340, "timestamp_created": 1506644340, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 271, "steamid": "76561198085554511", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 91, "last_played": 1507055264, "playtime_forever": 271}, "votes_up": 28, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35284020", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549427", "review": ">join game\n>spawn into fight that's already going strong\n>beat up blue guy\n>green guy kicks me in the head near death\n>get shotgun\n>blast red guy\n>green guy moves in to finish me\n>jump\n>fire shotgun\n>go flying into oblivion\n>green guy teabags, wins\n\n10/10\n\nWould fly again", "votes_down": 18, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 70, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506665628, "timestamp_created": 1506665628, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 359, "steamid": "76561198021350492", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 285, "last_played": 1506751193, "playtime_forever": 359}, "votes_up": 48, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35403888", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534862", "review": "I was bored and searching the Steam Store for something fun that I could play with my friends.
