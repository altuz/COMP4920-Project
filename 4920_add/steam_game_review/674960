If you like any of those genres, you need to give this a try.\n\nRun around telling your mens where to go and what to build, then the sun sets and the wheels fall off as all sorts of hellbeats come crawling out of everywhere to eat and/or kidnap your whole village. Sure sure it's just little skellymens to start but soon you get golems, and bigger golems, and hella bigger golems, then the skeletons learn to cast spells, some bad guys from Doom show up with rocket launchers, and then finally these wiggly-ass'd hellsheep looking thing with skull masks try to drag your poor people off the map.\n\nCombat is hectic, but you've got to figure it out first. That would be my one real knock against the game: Crow Key, brosif, please, a tutorial would be so nice. Just maybe a twenty second one to explain things like \"If you don't have garrison when the first sun sets everyone will die.\" A little one.

To cut to the chase: This is a rogue-type RTS game that has heavy levels of RNG in it to have you to survive. One of aspects of the game is leveling up your hero which grants more health and stronger hero abilities for each tier you've unlocked. The game requires that you juggle between leveling your character or your base structures through [b] Aether. [/b] [b] Aether[/b] and Material are the key of the game's mechanics as you're forced to mine out Material and kill monsters for Aether with the game increasing it's difficult each step of the way.\n\nThe game, after a few nights, becomes exceedingly difficult if you don't keep on your Hero's Level and the level of your defenses around your Crystal. With some of the RNG events, like nights where Goblins bomb the living hell out you to nights of peace with fire flies flying around, you can either lose that run or exhale that deep breath you were holding onto to let your workers work at night.\n\nOverall, this game is fun and I enjoy it deeply.
