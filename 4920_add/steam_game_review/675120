The game has a very nice retro look and a good retro soundtrack and if you enjoy retro platformers this game is a definite must buy.\n\nThe controls in this game are simple and very responsive.  You have 3 buttons, attack, jump, and reflect.  Attack and jump are exactly what you would expect, when you hit the reflect button your knight sounds out a wave in front of him.  This wave does not damage enemies at all but will destroy any projectile on impact.  Use of this mechanic is mandatory to fight certain enemies and get over tricky jumps which would otherwise be impossible due to streaming projectiles.  It is implemented well and adds an extra layer of gameplay to the game.\n\nThe game is split into 8 worlds.  You are given 3 lives and unlimited continues, you can also stop at anytime and contine from the last level you left off at.  Extra lives are awarded at 15000 and 35000 points(I never got any higher than that), and a typical playthrough of most levels will grant you at least 15000 points meaning you will usually have 4 lives to complete a level.  Each level is divided into 2 sections than a boss battle, if you die you start from the last checkpoint, if you lose all your lives you start back from the beginning of the stage.\n\nThe level design is great, has all the typical locales one would expect, and the game has a nice smooth difficulty curve.  The first few levels are nice and easy as are the bosses but the difficulty ratchets up a few levels into the game.  This is a challenging game, expect to die while you learn the levels, but it is not a frustratingly difficuly game.  You could probably get through the early levels without continuing and in the later levels you may have to continue a few times but you won't be smashing any controllers cursing at the screen.  Most of the challenges in the game are fair and when you die it is your fault, there are a very small handful of times where you get killed by something you had no way of knowing was there but these are so infrequent they are not worth worrying about.  \n\nOverall crusader crash is an incredibly fun retro throwback that gets just about everything right.  Solid retro graphics and music, fun and varied level design, tight controls, and a decent challenge, the game sells for $4 and for that price this game is a steal .", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506387402, "timestamp_created": 1506387402, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 123, "steamid": "76561198116707297", "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 1298, "last_played": 1506386537, "playtime_forever": 123}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
