I wouldn't recommend it.  The game is still in Early Access and is in a pre-alpha state and comes off relatively bland and somewhat featureless.  \n\nThe developer does seem to have a few interesting ideas up their sleeve and I'm curious to see if they manage to bring them to fruition.  If so then I'll gladly change my review to a recommend because some of the ideas presented look like they could be really fun.  \n\nJust for now I'd hold off on hitting that buy button unless you feel like floundering around a pretty barren desert, hoping you don't dehydrate.  \n\nKind of like I did here (also if you wanna see it in action): https://youtu.be/XP1hxjVULWw", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502861892, "timestamp_created": 1502861892, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025227359", "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 169, "last_played": 1502860677, "playtime_forever": 23}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34556131", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "I support this game and early access games from people with an idea.
