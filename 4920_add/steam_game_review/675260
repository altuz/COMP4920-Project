If you want a game that is going to make you cry, go back and play the Walking Dead Season 1. If you want Telltale's newer titles to be written better, try inciting a boycott in the forums.

Gameplay is certainly more interesting; getting to choose what takedown you want to perform on the fly does add a bit of spice to clicking random buttons whenever a prompt shows up like a trained monkey.\n\nThe story is what made this episode less than stellar. Because, at least 3 \"twists\" during the episode can be seen coming from a mile away. Without giving any spoilers, it's very clear that the writers had to ignore a [strike]gaping[/strike] glaring plothole in order to make one of the \"twists\" work and to move the plot forward.\n\nAlthough, I did like a relationship between Batman/Bruce Wayne and another character that they included and played around with throughout the episode.
