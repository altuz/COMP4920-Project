Script still desperately needs to be proof-read and edited for grammar though.\n\n--\nI really wanted to like this but compared to other Dogenzaka Labs VNs (which I like overall), it's a gigantic mess.\n\nI can ignore the low resolution backgrounds and cluttered main story screen. For whatever reason, characters aren't given their own screens in this so it's up to you to sort through 6 pages worth of stories and figure out the character continuity if any. Sure, OK, I can deal with that.\n\nWhat's unforgiveable is the quality of the translation and its presentation. [strike]There is no word wrapping in the text box so words will be cut mid-line and continue on the second line. If you can get past that without your brain melting eventually[/strike], you'll have to deal with what appears to be [b]a total lack of editing/proof-reading[/b]. Within seconds of starting the butler route, I was inundated with so much truncated gibberish, I couldn't even tell what was going on. I promptly stopped and came here to write this.\n\nJudging by the cluttered main story screen, this VN seems to have a lot of text. Out of the 36 stories, about 19 of them are dedicated to the main step-brother, some of them \"main\" (with a significant amount of chapters), a lot of them side. The amount of content seems staggering but none of this means a thing if it's unreadable.\n\nThis sort of thing can be patched but until it is, there's not much point getting it now if you intend to read it in English.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "10", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505408519, "timestamp_created": 1505159742, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198032673602", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 572, "last_played": 1505408242, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 26, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
