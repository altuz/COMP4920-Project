I see it as a new, growing platform that needs an enthusiastic audience so it can develop as a medium for entertainment.  The few good ones I have experienced have been amazing, immersive experiences.  For example, Miyubi, Allumette, Old Friend reminded me of the first time watching Avatar in 3D at the movie theatre (experiencing something new and magical).\n\nHowever, this VR episode is a muddled mess.  As much as I want to support it, I cannot recommend it.  There's just too many things that make it difficult to enjoy.  First of all, the story is not well written or structured.  There's actually very few spoken lines in the entire 24 minute runtime.  Most of the time the camera is too busy moving around at very weird angles and also scales to even notice what's supposed to be happening.  There's just very poor direction in this episode.  There's a few \"violent\" scenes, but I have no idea why they happened.  The dialogue did not help at all in deciphering what's going on.  The scenes are too dependent on the visual surroundings that are supposed to carry the story forward (I suppose is what the director was going for).\n\nSecondly, the game world visuals are not pretty to look at.  The world look very grimy, with an almost 70s style grainy movie filter.  There's very few colors in the world, mostly green and browns.  It's a very poor game engine to use, ps3 era type of game engine and the textures are very low.  There's nothing visually appealing to look at and enjoy.  And the camera just keeps moving around, high, low, around, now everything is big, now everything is small.\n\nLastly, the voice acting is okay.  There's just very few lines.  I'm sure the actors did their best job, but how can you convey anything with such short dialogue?  There's really not much there for the actors to have worked with.  The music is also fine.  In fact, it's probably the best thing about the episode, but still nothing too memorable either.\n\nOverall, I was bored watching this and was waiting for the 24 minutes to be over.  And at the end you're just riding on the longest elevator ride with a view of what might as well be a parking lot.  And the animations of the guy there (behind you) are just being repeated of him smoking.  I won't ask for a refund, but I don't think this episode is worth anything.\n\nRate 3/10 only buy if you want to support VR movies so hopefully we get better content, i.e. you have money to burn\n\n", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504148265, "timestamp_created": 1504148265, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1504234892, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34649545", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497314", "review": "Even if this were free, I would not recommend it.\n\nThe story is not clear at all and half of it is a camera just very, very slowly creeping down hallways with no action or narrative in sight.
