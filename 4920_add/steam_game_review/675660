The sound effects kind of weirded me out, as the goblins (at least I think they're goblins) sound like infants... or some kind of squeaky, rubber duck. The combat is very simple, and key bindings which are on the menu, don't actually do anything in game. There is a jump button. You can rebind it. You cannot jump in game.\n\nWorst of all, this game is on Steam on the same degree as any finished product, but it is not. After beating any of the two levels, there is in game text that states \"game is in development stage.\" Nowhere on the store page does Idea Cabin say that Relic Keepers is still in development. That's withholding information, not a feature that you will \"add more content for free.\" Either slap it in right on the game description that the game is not finished, or put it up as an Early Access game.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505512061, "timestamp_created": 1505269251, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993925975", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 58, "last_played": 1505268453, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34925929", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512744", "review": "Defend a sword from waves of demons and goblins that make the most dumb sounds ever.
