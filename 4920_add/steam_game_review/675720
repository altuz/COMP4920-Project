It makes you want to kill yourself very fast.\n\n-Now another horrible thing about this suffer machine - VISUALS - you are chased by rainbow vomit, and it constantly glowing and changing colors - EPILEPSY - On top of that EVERY GOD DAMN PASSED BLOCK REVERTS THE COLOR SCHEME OF THE LEVEL - EPILEPSY. Even if you turn off the color change thing the game itself remains a toxic colors mess, it hurts to play this thing.\n\n-The game's concept is VERY simple, this guy made the exact copy of Audiosurf, every second it generates new obstacle, speed increases every few obstacles until you die. This problem of this dogsh`t is that obstacles generated with randomizer with a set amount of holes and because of that - Very hard - difficulty is 5 times easier than normal ill explain below\nEasy - 3 lanes - every obstacle contains 2 walls and one hole -  short track and 33% of the space is empty - OKAY\nNormal - 4 lanes - every obstacle contains 3 walls and one hole - very and very annoying because you are constantly getting holes at the opposite parts of the track so when its speeds up you have to constantly mash your keyboard.\nHard - 5 lanes - every obstacle contains 3 walls and 2 holes - easy as hell because most of the road basically is empty and it's very easy to reach 500+ lanes\nVery hard - 7 lanes with 2 or 3 holes - Can be hard sometimes because the initial speed is high and the track is wide enough to make this a problem\nInsane - 9 lanes with 3 holes - basically it's really hard because once you face couple of lanes where it has 3 holes at left then 3 holes at right you CAN press it fast enough buy your shit may easily get stuck because it's not moving that fast sideways\n\n-500 steam achievements - it has quite a few steam achievements but the problem that they are very hard to obtain, you have to reach wave 500 on every difficulty + you have to farm something around 13 000 blocks passed to unlock all the ships, don't forget that this game is suffering to play. You can buy a slow mode for 3000 - it changes the initial speed modificator and increases the amount of the blocks passed to every speed increase, so you can actually reach 500 lanes on every difficulty, but keep in mind that you WILL suffer from one more thing:\nTHE INITIAL SPEED ON EVERY DIFFICULTY IS MEGA SLOW - it takes \u0441rap ton time to get through the very first 100-200 lanes, and then when it speeds up it's really easy to die on lane 400 or 500 and you WILL HAVE TO SUFFER ALL OVER AGAIN. \n\n+You can pause the game and take a break at any lane, pause is working good, it gives you like 1 second to understand what is going on on the table when you unpause.\n+\u0421\u043e\u0441k skin for your ship\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1115490366\n\nIt is a good game to gift to a person you hate.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504368822, "timestamp_created": 1503268409, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198028673669", "num_reviews": 320, "num_games_owned": 5466, "last_played": 1506036455, "playtime_forever": 570}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34642250", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502154", "review": "Love it it's extremely mind numbing", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504208656, "timestamp_created": 1504208656, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198302640982", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 9, "last_played": 1505350014, "playtime_forever": 905}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
