IMO the HexWar game engine is better suited to Napoleonic battles than it is to WW II armoured clashes.\n\nThe Peninsular War is a relatively little explored theatre in computer wargames and I knew I would buy the game on release as I have had an interest in the war since reading the Sharpe novels as a kid.\n\nI'd say it's well worth the \u00a36 or so they are currently asking for it.

The designers paid very little attention to building the behavior of different kinds of units and formations into the game, but lavished attention on glitzy graphics and animated sprites.  Being a graphics modder I have nothing against glitzy graphics, but the core functions of the game shouldn't suffer at their expense.\n\nThis game feels like it was meant to be played on a tablet, and the designers decided to toss out any aspect of reality that wasn't tablet friendly.  Unfortunately, by its nature, Napoleonic warfare isn't tablet friendly, and if you make it look like it is what you've made is a tablet game dressed up in Napoleonic costume.\n\nSeveral of the formations (notably the square) are currently exhibiting some odd behavior, but I'm sure (or at least I would hope) that the developers will squash these bugs after a few patches.  But the designers seem to be unaware (or don't care) that a Napoleonic battalion in column formation was essentially incapable of marching down a road or crossing a bridge because each company in the battalion was actually in line formation (a hundred or so yards across), with the four to six companies of the battalion stacked one behind the other (which means that French columns tended to be a hundred yards wide and twelve to eighteen men deep -- not really what we normally think of as a column).\n\nI played this game for half an hour before it became clear that this was a no go.  You might learn something about the war in the Peninsula from playing this, but as far as Napoleonic warfare goes, it's a waste of time.  For all their faults, JTS Software produces much better Napoleonic titles (including one on the Peninsular War).", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504808408, "timestamp_created": 1504808408, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198117221161", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 195, "last_played": 1504742264, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
