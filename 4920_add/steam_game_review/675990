I did enjoy this game a great deal, I will play it more next weekend, I'm sure. It's very sweet, funny and charming. It is also quite addictive as there is the urge to just do one more quest. It's a quirky game and it really appeals to me. It seems that this is early access which hopefully means they'll add more levels and things. I'm not close to finished with the game (I think) but it will be interesting to see what they do with it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503255237, "timestamp_created": 1503255237, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030916122", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 207, "last_played": 1503791756, "playtime_forever": 277}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34520400", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506695", "review": "Great little time killer with a lot of comedy and choices that matter....", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503807076, "timestamp_created": 1503807076, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "steamid": "76561198077297773", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 40, "last_played": 1506168475, "playtime_forever": 122}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34311512", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501657", "review": "This game is addicting and funny as hell!
