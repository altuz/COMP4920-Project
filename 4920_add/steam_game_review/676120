I was thinking it crashed or frozen. After 3 attempt to start, I was heading to the forum and people were saying, it is just needs 4 mins to load up. Yes with SSD and with a kickass Gamer PC.\nThen after 4 mins, the game starts, in windowed mode (of course the good old ALT+ENTER did not work), then there is an unskippable demo (with no sound whatsoever). I am already around 7-10 mins and I did not even played. Then finally, you have the option to choose language and head to the settings. I recalibrated the graphic details and then....\nyou need to restart the game (NOOOOOOOO),\nOkay, I restarted the game, I waited another 7-10 mins, and finally I was in the rooster to choose my character and beat some asses (and chew bubble gum). \nBlack screen and only sound (OMG WHAT THE****), okay Alt+TAB always helps, pressed it and out of blue finally I have got picture in full screen with sound (YAYYY), but....\nthe game is pretty awfull. It is not bad, it is just not good. I played 2 matches and pressed the ESC...\nOh wait, nothing happens, how the hell am I suppose quit from this? Okay my friend Alt+TAB will help, he is always helps, I never got dissapointed in Alt+Tab. He was my shinning hero, who saved my sorry @55. Task manager, end task and...\nthe game is still on. Okay no panic man, you can do that, I repeated the same procedure like 5x and finally the game is died. \nHuh that was creepy, so I called the exterminator ( Uninstall + Refund) to beat this ****the ****out it,\n\nSo this is my story with Sango Guardian (in 720p, as there is no option to change resolution.)\n\nThank you for listening :D :D", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502220033, "timestamp_created": 1502220033, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021368242", "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 721, "last_played": 1502219288, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34096995", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509424", "review": "mikado be with us", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502173698, "timestamp_created": 1502173698, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014925671", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 322, "last_played": 1502173558, "playtime_forever": 40}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34462564", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500815", "review": "So... this game is a trainwreck. It takes on average 4 minutes to load. It has no training mode. There's like maybe one or two songs in the game. It's a very huge mess of a game that probably has no business being released.\n\nBut why the hell do I recommend this game? I know there are folks out there who have played fighting games long before Street Fighter IV came out, long before the idea that \"balance\" was a big deal and the need to patch and make adjustments here and there to overall make it \"competitive\" or what have you.\n\nSango Guardian represents a time period where none of that was a thing. You just find some weird fighting game while browsing the internet, you sat down and played it, and you find the most brokenest thing that you can, have a lot of fun trying to figure out how this game ticks, and you just roll with it. For many, this was a weekend filled with hours of fun, trying to make sense of stuff like \"Holy crap, this guy's crouching light kick has barely any pushback and it's spammable for like 15 hits\" or \"Wait what, this guy can combo off of normal grab into super and do like 50% of their life?!\"\n\nIf you got local friends (because this game has no online) who are into random janky fighting games, then honestly you're all set. This is perfect for those occasions where otherwise you're playing some random anime fighting game that isn't BlazBlue or Guilty Gear, or maybe playing some old arcade fighting game off of MAME, or maybe you finally found out what the heck Dong Dong Never Dies is. And even by yourself, this game has quite a bit of things to keep your entertained, possibly leaving you appaled every time you find something new.\n\nAnd it's not that this game is unplayable either. It's very much playable and not sluggish at all. Sure, it has optimization problems from what I understand, though I haven't really ran into these issues. But for the price you're paying? You can't really do any wrong here. Save yourself the money from buying another soulless Street Fighter V DLC character and just put it towards this.

Sure, there are tons of moves and mechanics straight copied from various 2D fighters (Street Fighter IV and King of Fighters mostly). Certainly not the prettiest game in the world. Yes, the loading on start up takes 4-5 min. and the game is not the best optimized. Yes, 2 Player Vs. mode & training mode was not available at launch (Still had 2 player jump in during 1P mode and Vs. has been added as of this writing), but the developers have been responding to the discussion threads and doing their best to update at least (You can skip the intro movie. Press T on default keyboard settings). Honestly, it could be far worse and there has been way worse than this.\n\nNow as for the game itself, it actually plays well given that it's a hodgepodge of \"throw things to a wall and see what sticks\" and is a fun game to play. Overall very easy to pickup and play if you already have experience with SF, KoF or FGs in general. And even then, only $7.99 so you're really not losing much. Hopefully the game can be ironed out some in the future. Give it a try and you may be surprised if you're willing to look past the issues and have some silly good fun.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503374192, "timestamp_created": 1503374192, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198002825131", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 464, "last_played": 1503725532, "playtime_forever": 417}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34109843", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501520", "review": "Solid fighter, very nice graphics.\n\nI want them to release the training mode so that I can get to grips with the awesome fighting mechanics.\n\nLoading time is abit long at the start and no 2player versus atm.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502218814, "timestamp_created": 1502218814, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065848287", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 78, "last_played": 1502683336, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
