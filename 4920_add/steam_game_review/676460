It looks like a lot of fun, but I would advise waiting... just in case. \n\nPros:\nNice atmosphere, well designed graphics.  \nReasonably good sounds too. \n\nCons: (I'm sure the developer will address all of this in later patches.)\nAlthough the game claims \"Anything can be used as a weapon\" (At least in early areas), not much is.  Enemies do not drop weapons, and nothing is within reach. \nMovement once the game is started does not seem to work. \nCollision physics are a bit wonky.  Things that should hit don't, things that shouldn't do.  Wind up flailing randomly because it makes very little sense. (Which works??)\nWhen \"Hit\" they use the FPS cliche of surrounding the view with red, but the way it's implemented shrinks the vision down to a basketball after the first hit making it very annoying and difficult to see.  Since there's no healing/regen, after that 1st hit, you're stuck with the deminished view permanently. \nGame over screen may say you've won, or lost, incorrectly. \n", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506741444, "timestamp_created": 1506741444, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "steamid": "76561197970724308", "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 936, "last_played": 1506740876, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
