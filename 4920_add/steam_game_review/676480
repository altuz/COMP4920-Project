Most games need to grow on me. Jettomero didn't. Instead, it instantaneously made me feel home. I launched the game, saw, heard, read, clicked a little, and there I was, already in a state of euphoric cosiness.\nOf course, this makes sense, since you can pretty much tell from its trailer how much it relies on seduction. Actually, a few seconds of its trailer were enough to conquer me.\n\nStill, it's a thrill to let it bring me back to my late 90s /early 2000s, when the generic art student that I was was raving to the beautifully naive, silly and other-wordly melodies that kept popping out from record labels such as Warp, Planet Mu, Rephlex, or Tigerbeat.\nJettomero : [i](unwise)[/i] Hero of the Universe, like a few other space games out there (thinking of Nate Schmold's delightful Cosmochoria), has this particular mood, - both melancholic and good-humoured -, that was like the common emotional ground on which the aforementioned wacky, clicketty-clacking sci-fi scores were standing. When I did shut down the game, I felt an urge to dig my music library for some Bogdan Raczynski, Arovane and Jega tunes that I hadn't been listening to for a long time.\nNaturally, special attention has been paid to Jettomero's soundtrack (which can be purchased on Steam as a DLC). It is deeply rooted in this electronica scene, and well, it's fine [i]Music for yet-another-stroll-on-a-distant-world[/i]. To put it simply, it's very [i]Boards-of-Canada[/i]-ish, it works great, and you may well end up humming one of its tunes while doing housework.\n\nSo what is Jettomero like, gameplay-wise ? To be honest, I don't care much. It is very simple, in the sense that it is both easily understood and done, and humble. It is very probable that the people at Ghost Time Games didn't care that much either. The essential point is that they made it feel smooth. That's enough, because what I'm here for is to enjoy the audiovisual ride.\nAnd it's a damn nice and fluent ride. Jettomero's comic book style truly works wonders. This clumsy, clueless giant robot is adorable.\nJust peek at the community's screenshots page, and you'll see that the game's integrated photo mode (which lets you pause the game, choose your angle and apply filters to your images) can give quite impressive results illustration-wise, and that it might prove a fun toy to tinker with.\n\nThanks, Gabriel & others, that's great work!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505928661, "timestamp_created": 1505843931, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "steamid": "76561198126116795", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 173, "last_played": 1506452876, "playtime_forever": 455}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35312323", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "Charming game where you discover the history of a fun robot through a fairly repetitive process of jumping into a wormwhole, exploring a few planets, finding a big monster, defeating it, rinse wash repeat.\n\n\nThe game was developed by a single developer which is an incredible feat considering how great the game looks, feels and sound. I give it a recommendation because I'm a sucker for games that have a strong sense of style and likeable protagonists, however, the timed events and repetitive nature of the gameplay might not please everyone. It also has a few bugs having been released only recently.\n\n\nI would almost have prefered a more condensed experience lasting 2 hours so I wouldn't have had the chance to get used to the mechanics of the game before it ended with a surprise.

Around 80 parts to collect)\n- The story\n- Music with sfx\n\nMixed Feeling:\n\n- The action: while its fun to destroy the first few \"civilization\" you meet but it get old fast since there not much diversity in both the civilizations you see and the destruction you can bring upon them ( no special attack, just stomp or walk trought to destroy)\n\nNOte: For me its was better to play with a controller since i didn't like how to keyboard control was.\n\nAll and all ill still recommend it since its not just another asset flipping game and the devs put efforts into it.\n", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505490176, "timestamp_created": 1505490176, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026280814", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 421, "last_played": 1505482697, "playtime_forever": 62}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35484261", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Jettomero: Hero of the Universe is a short and relaxing game about a robot doing its best to save what remains of humanity. You should expect your adventure to last around 3 hours or less depending on how much you engage with photo mode and the huge number of filters.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the game\u2019s biggest weakness which is its repetitiveness. You\u2019re not going to have any moves unlocked as you play. You can clumsily walk around, trying not to destroy innocent people, swatting away angry human spaceships, stomp the ground to collect new body parts or just for fun, and engage in a boss battle if the planet has one occupying it (followed by a decoder puzzle). Then you can take off and fly around space into a wormhole or so that you can land on another planet to explore. The lack of gameplay variety means Jettomero is best experienced in shorter sessions despite its already short playtime.\n\nWhat kept me playing was the game\u2019s continued delivery of a chill experience and my curiosity about the robot\u2019s past. It\u2019s backed by a soothing soundtrack filled with synths as I tried to avoid smashing into things\u2026 usually. I was heroic for the most part, I swear. The strong visual style and wonderful filters also kept me entertained, especially when I noticed filters carry over into the boss cutscenes. I definitely had my handful of favorite ones that I used regularly, but the default game already looks great.\n\nThe photo mode is also a good addition to this game as I probably spent way too much time tweaking filters, angles, and finding just the right position for that perfect or not-so-perfect shot. Here are some examples:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1158217279\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1157362901\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1157362966\n\nWhen it comes to the value proposition of the game, I think I received my money\u2019s worth at $13. That\u2019s very subjective though and dependent on your disposable income. If you\u2019re on the fence, then definitely reconsider it during a sale. I do recommend picking the game up if you\u2019re looking for a chill time and not overlooking the fun of photo mode.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507168430, "timestamp_created": 1507168430, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 184, "steamid": "76561197982079483", "num_reviews": 110, "num_games_owned": 809, "last_played": 1507158573, "playtime_forever": 184}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35055975", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Although a bit short, everything about this game makes me love it.
