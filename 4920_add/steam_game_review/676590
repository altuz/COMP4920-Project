Each stage is designed to be replayed and littered with stars.\nGetting all stars on all levels is going to be the true test.\n\nThe game features 35 levels spread across three worlds. You will want to return to these again and again because you\u2019ll want to get the unlocking content like new characters. \n \nThe game evokes feel of 2D Mario games, but it is a deceptively simple game that serves as a full-bodied celebration of genre runner-jump.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501084378, "timestamp_created": 1501084378, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198319515523", "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 1108, "last_played": 1501085599, "playtime_forever": 237}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33805153", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478467", "review": "Nice 2d runner game with lots of different levels.
