A bit obtuse UI, lacking in instructions and could use a button to speed up test runs. But as of now I do not recommend this game. After playing for about an hour I discover that the game is not saving. Even for such a cheap game that is an unforgivable flaw. Will not play until this is patched.\n\nEdit: Seems that there is no patch or even comment from the developer.
