For around $5 it's certainly worth it.\n\n\nEDIT - Just buy the English version and don't be an idiot like me", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502617438, "timestamp_created": 1502078639, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198041816431", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 577, "last_played": 1502696852, "playtime_forever": 224}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
