You are attacked by bugs in waves with increasing complexity. Consumables in the form of turrets, mines and grenades will help you stay alive longer. With the help of a more powerful gun I think the pumping will go faster. In multiplayer you shoot bugs and other players. The maps in the game are not large.\n\nThis game leaves a very positive impression.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501945447, "timestamp_created": 1501943806, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198053451195", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 32, "last_played": 1506310971, "playtime_forever": 209}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34962827", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "after telling them there multiplayer doesnt work this still have not fixed it do not buy this shit its a waste of money and time thanksyou and go fuck yourself devs!", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505445007, "timestamp_created": 1505445007, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198147114308", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 29, "last_played": 1504755840, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
