Can't say I expected much, but at least i was hoping for an enjoyable kill-time little game. Risks were calculated But oh man was I bad at math . \n\nSo The game plot setting seems a little cliche : detective, muder, supernatural element, ghosts, investigation in the middle of the effing night (who does that ?! ). But it promises me \"deep horror experience\" and \"no screamers\" and puzzles. Sounds interesting enough. \n\n( First time set-up took me 20 minutes. for a 500MB game that's pretty long, but it just could be my potato computer. ) \n\nThus I was thrown to this abandoned seemingly haunted house with a flashlight, which was probably a luminated donut because it has a big black spot in the center of the lighting. I had to examine things from the corner of my view, otherwise i can't see sh*t. The amount of batteries are very limited, and they burn faster than Usian Bolt.  Is this intended for added horror experience ?\n\nThe tutorial and hint style is somehow familiar, then I found a twinkling book that read \" PRESS TO SAVE PROGRESS\". Press what to save ?   PRESS WHAT TO SAVE? I tried almost every key on the keyboard, also my mouse. Nothing worked. I feel trolled. \n\nAlso, everytime I go through a door the game throws me at an weird angle. Sometimes I am facing the door i just came through, sometimes forward, sometimes to the left. It's just very confusing. \n\nPuzzels in this game aren't strictly \"puzzles\", most of the time you'll just be running around checking every nook and cranny for items, then use these items on obvious places. It doenst seem that the devs put too much effort into puzzel design. I mean cmon, a flash game could do better than this ! \n\nAfter 20 minutes of gameplay, I couldn't save, ran out of batteries, in-game sound dissappeared, and i was bored to my skull.\n\n Dio Alias Games does an okay job with casual sim games like Battle of painters and Joy Pony, and it might be a brave move for them to step into a new genre. But sorry, this game is just not good at all , it's not even sincere, It feels like a quick money grab. And it certainly not worth 1.7 bucks. \n\nP.S. \"No screamers \" is a lie", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502940327, "timestamp_created": 1502940327, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007747398", "num_reviews": 61, "num_games_owned": 226, "last_played": 1502938721, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34283138", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513296", "review": "https://youtu.be/eaRrBkLU_8Q\n\nSo basically so far this game has been the usual unity 'horror' fare. You plod around at at agonising pace looking for items to interact with. Yes there is a torch. Yes you need to find batteries and yes the batteries burn out faster than a speed runner on crack. However this torch works opposite to most - there is a large black blob in the middle where light should be forcing you to hold the torch up above the thing you wish to illuminate. \n\nThe 'puzzles' so far have all been find the item needed to progress. However even this mechanic is iffy - some items have a clear icon showing there is something to interact with, sometimes they dont - leading to a fun game of hunt the pixel with a torch that does not work and bleeds batteries. \n\nSo atmosphere? Well the vivuals are halfway decent, but nothing outstanding and there are certainly better looking games out there. Audio is sparse and adds little to the game.\n\nSo my experience so far has revealed the only thing behind the door is a tedium. Some doors are better off left shut.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502913683, "timestamp_created": 1502913683, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 1203, "last_played": 1505166003, "playtime_forever": 64}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34662340", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "review": "It's not terrible, but ultimately playing it isn't a very fulfilling experience.\n\nGameplay consists of exploring an abandoned house, spamming your E key hoping to find the item you need to complete the puzzle you're confronted with. Some of these items are easily spotted and even have icons suggesting they can be used, while others don't, for whatever reason. Providing you find the right items though, the puzzles won't test you in the slightest. Saving, however, proved to be challenging.\n\nVisually, the game looks pretty decent. If you've ever played a Unity horror game from Gamejolt or Itch.io, chances are you'll know what to expect. Audio is okay, with some basic ambient noises and sound fx adding a little extra creepiness to the experience.\n\nIs the game scary? \nNot especially. Don't listen to that \"No screamers\" bit in the description.\n\nCompleting the game will probably take you around 20-40 minutes, after which you'll probably regret becoming in any way invested.\n\nI've paid for far worse, but overall, I still wouldn't recommend this unless you've really run out of other games to play.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1sXaIZKBHY", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504379830, "timestamp_created": 1504279585, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197975093091", "num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 434, "last_played": 1504188609, "playtime_forever": 66}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34311227", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504465", "review": "For a full playthrough please see my youtube video below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwqkBIOynHE&feature=youtu.be\n\nTL:DR - Behind the Door is a decent little game, considering it is made in Unity, and I feel it's worth the price. \n\nIt's a bit short, and assuming you got lost like me, can take up to 1 hour to complete. The graphics are OK, would prefer if they were higher definition but again, Unity game. The sound design is pretty good, the effects are crisp and well chosen.\n\nThe gameplay itself is standard fair. Go here, find an item, use the item on object and receive spooks. The atmosphere is average again for a horror game, very dark, and the flashlight doesn't help a great deal. The 'batteries' for it to me seem mostly useless, because it's such a short game, the batteries only last for like 5 minutes. Would suggest using batteries like this for much longer games.\n\nThe spooks mainly come from the atmosphere and anticipation of things lurking in the darkness, but I would like to warn people, while the game description states it doesn't have 'screamers', it DOES have jumpscares. They don't happen often and are placed pretty well at the end of atmospheric segments.\n\nThe story is almost non-existent, with there only being a brief mention at the start of the game. You never really find out what happened and why. Would advise to add more story elements to the next game.\n\nThere are a few bugs. The first is that 2 crucial items (the cup and leaky pipe in the bathroom) do not have a cog icon indicating they can be used. The second is the flashlight having a black splodge in the centre, but the developers have said they will fix this in an update.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502989603, "timestamp_created": 1502989603, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197988088832", "num_reviews": 36, "num_games_owned": 312, "last_played": 1502983182, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
