Played for about 30 minutes and then felt like I had no idea what I was doing or how to progress. I had gone all the way one direction, and then all the way back another direction (which takes ages because the game's \"sprint\" speed is atrociously slow, and even with sprint being the speed of a brisk walk, there's still stamina, making walking take wayy to long.) After doing this I found a guide on the community hub and used it to realize that there's a specific order of operations that you have to follow to proceed through the beginning of the game. These things that you are required to do this in specific order are not clearly set out for you and you have no way of knowing where to go first or what you're even supposed to be looking for or interracting with.\n\nAfter around an hour of play time I managed to find the first \"scary\" thing, which with the graphics is not that scary, and essentially, with the way the game works, you're supposed to avoid this scary creature as effectively as you can. If it sees you, you are dead, so you pretty much try not to even look at it. I then got bored of trying to navigate a complex maze of a building (while trying to avoid this creature) to find out what I was supposed to be doing on my own, and then I gave up.\n\nOn top of all of this stuff, the english voice acting was among the worst I've ever heard in a game. I know this game is in early access, but if this game ever intends to draw an audience, it has -a ton- of work that needs to be done on it.", "votes_down": 9, "language": "english", "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501878849, "timestamp_created": 1501878849, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198061724678", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 74, "last_played": 1502931627, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 16, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34146193", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506817", "review": "At this point I can say with certainty, people are NOT going to enjoy creeping from room to room over and over again waiting for something to change, listenning to high school kids read their scripts, and thinking of ways to tape or weight the W key down. Left stick of an Xbox controller does work, btw. The graghics are [graces must be given here] weak at best, with trees outside coming indoors through walls.
