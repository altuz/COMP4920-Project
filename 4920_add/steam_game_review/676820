Bithell uses these topics as a springboard into mystery about a robot detective investigating other missing robots on an underground rail transit system.

To me this title, along with Oxenfree demonstrates that with good writing and enough player involvement, you can make a compelling game out of just two people talking. Everyone you talk to on the train has a memorable personality, from a bot that speaks in flowery decelerations of love, to a corporate bot who tries to tie every convo to the product he's shilling. \n\nIt lasts exactly as long as it needs to be, is priced appropriately and the ending leaves a massive impact. It genuiely made me think, and will stay with me for a good while. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a nice, short offbeat sci fi story.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504657520, "timestamp_created": 1504657520, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198021261198", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 353, "last_played": 1504825767, "playtime_forever": 275}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34852169", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Subsurface Circular is fundamentally a text-based story game where you play as a robot detective, and the graphics, dialog, and premise itself build an awesome environment for those text conversations to take place in. It is not a long game (~2 hours plus a bit more cleaning up achievements), but it is a good one. I had massive expectations for the game as it is from the same team as the gem Thomas Was Alone, perhaps unrealistically high, so while I was a little let down by the fact that I wasn't sucked into the game, I did really enjoy it in the end. There are 2 (I don't think there's any other than 2) puzzles in the game which are suprising difficult for being seemingly a very small part of the game, but there is a built-in aid to solve them which does help, and they should be solvable by pretty much any player.\n\nGameplay takes place as text-based conversations with other robots on a train where your dialoge is choosen from a set of options you're given each time it is your turn to speak. You talk to a variety of robots from a variety of occupations, and the game does a great job painting a world and making each conversation seem unique. The game takes place as a 3D render of the robots as they sit on, enter, and exit the train which makes the game feel much more full than if it were simply the text. The rendering is nice and the intro scene is really neat. The music that plays is choosen well, but is mostly background. The story is interesting (as you would hope from a story-driven detective game), but not overwhelmingly so, and up until the end I would have had few qualms about getting up and taking a break if I had needed too, contrary to a game like OneShot that keeps you wanting to play more and more in the same sitting.\n\nIn terms of achievements, most are tied to progression and will be awarded in a single playthrough, and the others can be gotten in a few minutes by going back and replaying specific parts of specific scenes (you can choose to replay specific portions of the game once you've beaten it). A few may not be immidiately obvious as to how they are earned, but there are discussions on the game's Steam forum to help you figure it out.\n\nI guess the purpose of reviews is to help you answer the question: Should I buy this game? And I think the answer in this case is, yes, you should play through this game. However if you aren't super intrigued by the game's style, perhaps you should wait for a sale as it is on the short side, so the price may be a tad steep in some people's eyes.\n\n\n\nA Note (Mild Spoiler): After playing through this game I played back through Thomas Was Alone, and I really like how this game made subtle references to it. I think that did improve my opinion of this game, as they reference it in a very clever way that makes a lot of sense, and if you haven't played Thomas Was Alone, give it a go.
