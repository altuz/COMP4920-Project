From there, the story goes down a fairly predictable, but enjoyable path.\nSkye starts out incredibly weak, given only 4 HP and armed with a puny projectile weapon. This makes the game's difficulty primarily front-loaded, as for the first three worlds the game remains particularly stingy on upgrades. However, once the player starts to accumulate power-ups, things become a lot more tolerable.\nIn structure, Guardian most closely resembles Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, where it has several large zones strung together by an overworld map, and to finish the game each area would need to be fully explored, requiring multiple visits. Each zone has at least two boss encounters, one yielding a new ability for the player, and the other, a useless crystal shard to appease your deity. Infrequently, the game also resorts to the tried and true \u201ckill all enemies in the room\u201d method of progress gating, but thankfully, once cleared, those rooms remain empty henceforth.\nIn order to facilitate exploration and provide reasons to revisit areas, the game uses \u201cskeleton keys\u201d. Each new door requires an ever-increasing number of them, but opening one will not take keys away from the player. This means that the number of keys, in actuality, is your \u201ckey level\u201d.\nOther doors can be opened by special attacks and elemental magic. Magic, in particular, isn't all that useful in any other context, as for most of the game Skye can only cast it once or twice before needing to grind enemies to replenish her MP bar. Moreover, when used in combat the spells are weak and have inconvenient attack paths.\n\nIn the beginning of my first run through the game I was frustrated beyond all reason, mostly because my player was so weak, I barely had a chance to try a new strategy before getting murdered, but as time went on and her health increased, I came to grips with the controls and oddities of game design. On my second playthrough I breathed through the early areas.\n\nAfter nearly 20 hours and two complete play-throughs I am finally done with Guardian.\nAll in all, it's an enjoyable, if flawed, game. A lot of its downsides can be traced back to the developer's choice of middleware \u2013 Construct 2, the package one wants to use if they want that \u201cmade with sticks and duct tape\u201d look and feel. In my two playthroughs I have twice been hit by progress-blocking bugs, but the developer has patched those up since.\n\nFor all of its janky lack of polish, Guardian still has plenty of heart and a very earnest quality to it, not to mention decent presentation and plenty of content.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505365153, "timestamp_created": 1505363689, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561197997053623", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 438, "last_played": 1506490381, "playtime_forever": 1128}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34819693", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500412", "review": "In the few minutes that I played it, I could tell this game was far from finished.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504893218, "timestamp_created": 1504893218, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198109056948", "num_reviews": 26, "num_games_owned": 1394, "last_played": 1504893171, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
