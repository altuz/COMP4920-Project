I've begun playing it for some videos, so you can check those out here! :) \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak77YohSEgo\n\nMagic Potion Destroyer is a sort-of Auto Battler where you fight waves on a stage by stage basis, fighting tougher enemies until either you reach wave 100 or you clear the stage by using a certain spell which requires a certain amount of MP depending on the stage. You use MP you gain through battling to purchase upgrades for that stage and strengthen your character, but it all goes away after clearing the stage. \n\nThough there is a form of permanent progression in the form of Potions that you unlock by fulfilling various requirements, like clearing stages or reaching certain levels of stats, and you unlock Dose Points to equip potions with by pushing to the furthest wave you can on every level. The potions are extremely potent and can easily change how easy/hard your game is based on what you have equipped, like Double Max HP/MP, Double Attack/Regen, MP gained multiplier increase when you increase your Max MP, and Elemental Attacks.\n\nDa Moosic is also vurry good. 8/10\n\nI'm not extremely far into it (currently at stage 9), but I've greatly enjoyed progressing and going back to clear wave 100 on older stages. Overall I would definitely give this a positive, though I could imagine if the game had too many stages, the repetitive nature could become boring, though I think the in game speed ups of animations help this perhaps.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506619966, "timestamp_created": 1506618834, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 897, "steamid": "76561198028988454", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 851, "last_played": 1506993498, "playtime_forever": 897}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
