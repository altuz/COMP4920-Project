The game is fun and challenging! The climbinging aspect is fun, sort of like \"The Climb\". The stamina recovery system is a bit buggy. Make sure to hold on to objects with both hands until the heart beat steadies. Some levels require some puzzle solving. Free locomotion without any dizziness.

After about 10 minutes I found myself needing to take a break due to frustration from constant respawns.. not because I kept failing a jump, but because the poor player detection kept making me fall.\n\nSo for most ledges, the game has you grip the edge, lift yourself up and put the VR controllers behind your back. It's fun at first, but 3 times within the first 10 minutes I would lift myself up a ledge, let go, and have my character either get stuck and fall back down or suddenly be thrown into the sky due to bad physics and respawn.\n\nThe game is also very unforgiving with climbing in general. As I started to throw myself from one ledge to another, I quickly discovered that the game wants you to climb a very specific way.\nHurling myself from ledge to ledge would often result in a random fade-to-black respawn while I was still flying through the air because as far as the game was concerned, I was in the air without gripping a ledge for a long enough time that it thought I died, not realizing I was still flying towards a ledge.\n\nI still recommend Cloudborn because I love VR, and climbing is always a treat, but hopefully these bugs get resolved and aren't a part of how the game was designed. VR is all about freedom of movement, so when a game takes that freedom away, it's a lot more obvious in Virtual Reality than when using a controller.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506576310, "timestamp_created": 1506576034, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "steamid": "76561197970754349", "num_reviews": 93, "num_games_owned": 471, "last_played": 1506818179, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
