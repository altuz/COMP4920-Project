The only issue I had, and I'm not sure if it's an issue with the Rift or with the game, was that I couldn't change the look of the drum set.  Which was weird, because all the other customization options worked except for this one.  + The game starts off with 4 songs which you have to get an S rating on at least the easiest difficulty on each song, before unlocking the next set of 4 songs.  There's a total of 20 songs in the game library.  Most of the songs were from NTWO Studio (Korea) the developer, but some of them were from Mike B. Fort who had much better songs, while the dev songs were uneven in quality and had varying genres of music.\n\nAnyways, what really sets this game apart is all the customization options.  You can adjust the height, you can set the delay (they have a handy tool to measure any problems with visual or audio delays), you can play a song on three difficulties from easiest to hardest and you can play it at normal speed or half speed or twice as fast, or 1.5x.  There's just lots of options.  \n\nAs I said, I couldn't change my drumset but the option is in the menus.  You can also switch the VR environment (there's only 2 though, one is the default you've already seen and the other is a nicely done forest).  \n\nI had a blast using the very easy to use VR editor where you can beat down your own drum interpretation and share it with others.  In fact, I did that myself easily on my first try after watching a quick tutorial.  However, I don't know if you can add your own songs and I didn't see an option to do that.  Basically, you can edit the in-game songs.  They do describe the ability to edit your own songs, so maybe I missed something.\n\nAnyways, is this better than Drums Hero VR or Drummer Talent VR?  Not exactly.  But it does offer something very different with all the customization options.  I do recommend this game simply because of this.  Honestly, I wish there was a VR drum game that had the awesome songs of Drums Hero, with the realism of Drummer Talent VR, and with the customizations of Into the Rhythm.  Still, this was fun to play.  \n\nRate 8/10 ... changed score from 7 to 8 after discovering how easy it is to add your own beatmap or drum note highway to your own songs and play in VR, and how fun doing that is\n\n[u]UPDATE:[/u]\n\nApaprently the game now is listed as having Oculus Rift support and they are working to make it even more compatible (awesome).  Also, you can unlock the drum sets but it takes playing 100 times to unlock :O  ... And lastly, you can add your own songs using the 2D editor and share if you have license rights (but I still prefer the VR editor which is so easy and fun to use)\n\n[u] UPDATE #2 [/u]\nOh boy, I didn't realize how easy it was to create your own \"beatmap\" (drum notes) to your own songs for this game.  [b] I freaking created a beatmap for Tool Stinkfist HELLL YEAAAHH!!!! [/b] \n  All you have to do is:\n1)  Have a .wav or .mp3 format of your favorite song\n2) Start ITR directly from Steam Library \n3) Choose 2D VR editor\n4) Create New\n5) Choose .wav or .mp3 file\n6) save (it should save as ITR) *\n7) Start ITR VR\n8) Choose VR editor in the menus\n9) Open new project\n10) Select the file you want (of the mp3 or wav)\n11) Hit record **\n12) Do your best beat map or drum note highway in VR (feel the beat young padawan)\n11) Save and exit VR editor\n12) Play from custom songs \n* Note if you got an error on saving in the 2d editor, it won't work in VR editor either (this happened on 46 & 2 and I don't know why, the steps above worked on all other songs)\n** On Oculus Touch, you have to point at the tab like a laser is on your controller then trigger \n\nThat's it.  Your score will save and your IRL friends and family can play it.  Obviously, it's better if you have some drumming knowledge (I have zero except from games, but even my crappy beatmap was so much fun!!!)\n\nUPDATE #3\nClarified the songs available and unlocks, marked with + is the start", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "10", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506273532, "timestamp_created": 1505804198, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 247, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1506743020, "playtime_forever": 442}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35115017", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "[b] I should be born as octopus. [/b]\n\nWell I thought it should something like drums, but this is hard as french kissing a cobra. You should be an octopus to play this game. I don't know who these peoples with top scores on leaderboard panel. \nAlso this game has LOTS of techno music. First rock track opens on 3rd level, that sucks. Nevertheless on high level you will get more different types of music, chiptune, opera style, rock and may be something else. But if you want to open it you should complete opened musics on S at any level. That sucks too. I don't like techno, I don't like dub'step, after playing 2 hours I am completely dubstepped -_____- Why? Why don't you open all music at the start and make it by genre? \nGame has it's own editor, you can add your tracks and create your own paths. I don't know is it possible to do this on desctop, but in VR it doesn't seems very convenient. \n\nWell main idea is that you should have 8 hand to play this. \nVery hard. \nI am not pro drummer, but also are not complete noob, still I don't understand how to play this on NORMAL level sometimes. \n\n[b] You can watch my struggle compilation [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKgZpxrctDE] here[/url].
