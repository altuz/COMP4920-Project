In it's simplest form, the goal of the game, is to gradually increase the fame of your dungeon. This will open up new floors, loot and trap upgrades, and entice better equipped [strike] fools [/strike] heroes who, in their quest to feed their insatiable lust for shiny tat, are all too happy to risk falling prey to your fiendish traps and ravenous monsters.\n\nHowever, if your traps are too effective, or your monsters are too good at munching the bones of the hapless, your dungeon will fall into decline. You will need to balance it just enough, that you entice them in, and let [i] some [/i] leave, to continue to increase the fame, or infamy of your dungeon.\n\nAs your monsters level, you can improve their stats and even merge them to make new monsters... but with bigger teeth! And every real life day, you can take your minions to do battle on the surface.\n\nIt's the most fun I've had, from the least amount of money I've spent here on Steam in quite a while. And if you like strategy games at all you owe it to yourself to give this a try. You may like it.
