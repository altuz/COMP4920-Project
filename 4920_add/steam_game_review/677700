I noticed a few things that could be improved.\n\n1) Remove dead-ends from maps. The Cave map flows much better than the Town map because the player never runs into a room with only one way in/out. Just adding exterior doors to the rooms in the Town map would improve the flow.\n\n2) Make the pick-ups clearer. I couldn't tell what I was picking up until I'd collected it.\n\n3) Speed up player movement a bit. I think even a speed increase of 50% would make the game feel better.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502346315, "timestamp_created": 1502346315, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197969546230", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 219, "last_played": 1504937455, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34133596", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488597", "review": "The best way to describe this title would be if someone took a classic atari game from the Late 70s/Early 80s and added some flavor to the mix.
