So the gameplay is like this: You move on a map on small circles. Every few fields there are special fileds with events or fights. A fight is turn based and you use physical or magic attacks. You can gain levels and this inceases your stats. Also your stats are increased by -what I call- Karma-runes. All  together it is more like a board game. The graphics are beautiful and high resolution.\nThe story is told similar to a visual novel.\nI enjoy it so far.", "votes_down": 21, "language": "english", "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506795066, "timestamp_created": 1506795066, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 547, "steamid": "76561197988323561", "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 127, "last_played": 1506866312, "playtime_forever": 547}, "votes_up": 110, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35470559", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501451", "review": "Combat is painfully slow and devoid of any tactics. Sometimes you can talk your opponent(s) into not fighting, but most of the time you have to fight. You click on attack, a long animation (well, actually just a text saying how much damage you did) shows. Then your opponents attack, each showing a long animation again (well, actually it is a single image growing in size plus the damage text). \n\nSure, you can turn combat off, but you'd lose a large part of the game.\n\nOn the map you move along specific paths (shown as a line of circles). You have to click on every single circle to move, say, 20 paces to the right to reach the exit. Once again, painfully slow. You should click on \"Explore\" on every tile, too, so you don't miss anything. So, click on circle, click on \"Explore\" (all the way up near the top of the screen). Then circle, then \"Explore\". Again and again.\n\nThe one good thing about the game are the graphics. High-res, high-quality, very well drawn character images and backgrounds.\n\nThe story is so-so. Everyone I talked to tended to blabber on and on. There seems to be a nicely built world behind the game, but getting to it is, once again, painfully slow.\n\nAfter what felt like ages I realized that actually, I had spent less than two hours with this game.
