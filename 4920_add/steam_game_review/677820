It has A LOT of good ideas and mechanics, but the game has more bugs than even good ideas and mechanics. The terrible localization for english, to the point where many words are not in english even after setting the game to english, and sentences just get cut off by something, and you cannot read the last several words because it doesn't fit in the same amount of space as the original language. If you take ALL these things away, the game still will cough and spit at you as you try to play, and randomly empty your bank account to \"NaN\", whatever that is supposed to mean. This effectively ends your playtime.\n\n This should NEVER have been released in this state, as if the dev had just put together a solid product over a couple months, without all these bugs, I would say it is the best business simulator out there. After 2 hours, and multiple game ending bugs, I played for a solid 75 minutes in one playthrough, and saw many of this games hidden gems and features. I could NEVER recommend this game in it's current condition however, but I would be more than willing to take another look at it, if the dev put in the effort to release a product worth paying for. As of right now, there is just too much detracting from the shiny paint job to forgive it.\n\nTLDR: DO NOT BUY THIS! Too many bugs, Dev should NEVER have release something in this state, it is literally full of bugs and a hodgepoge of multiple language localization.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501264458, "timestamp_created": 1501264458, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006524453", "num_reviews": 43, "num_games_owned": 668, "last_played": 1501263708, "playtime_forever": 133}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "33860135", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489974", "review": "This game needs work. The english is spotty and a lot of the game is in finnish even if you select english as your language. The textures and graphics need a serious rework. For a game that is primarily focused on U.I., this game's U.I. is clunky and dosn't look good. The gameplay itself is promising, but needs better tutorials or a gude to reference, as the game gets complicated and it doesn't help when the complicated parts are in a foreign language.\n\nHere's my verdict. At the moment, with the amount of issues, I can't recommend this game. HOWEVER, if you write off this game because of the graphics you will be missing out on one of the most promising, original game concepts I have ever seen.\n\nEven with the confusion over the language and graphics issues, this game easily held my attention and interest much longer than some other AAA titles I have played. The idea of entrepreunership and business is one that seemlessly integrates into the videogame genre and yet has been missing, despite hundreds of \"tycoon\" games on the cusp of discovering this new genre. \n\nThis game absolutely nails the feelings and ideas behind business, allowing you freedom over your company as well as your tactics regarding it. For the first time in a videogame I really felt immersed in entrepreneurship. I think this game can really make an impact on videogames and create a new genre if they just fix it up.\n\nTo Do\n- Streamline the U.I.: The organization of it is almost there, but a few things feel out of place. This will mostly just take a lot of testing. I would recommend giving free copies to some people you know and ask them to take note of any confusion they had when navigating the menu.\n- Clean up the graphics: The city itself needs a bit of work. If you want to take the low-poly route like Unturned or Kingdoms and Castles, keep most surfaces texture-free and instead focus on lighting. If you want it to look more realistic you will need to put textures on every surface and still work on lighting a bit. The U.I. should be retextured to all fit the same style, I would recommend a minimalistic style to reduce the confusion further. Remember, keep it simple.\n- Translate everything: This can be costly if you have to bring people in to translate, but if nothing else feed all of the text into google translate. This way you will have grammatical errors, but it will still be readable, unlike now where I have to use google translate on my oen to understand it anyway.\n- Market the game: The only way I heard about it was when I specifically tried to find a game like it. You don't want your users to have to search to find this game, bring it to them. Find some youtubers that play similar games, such as Avaak or Etalyx, and send them free copies. (I would recommend upgrading the graphics first.) Their fans are interested in these types of games and if they are captivated by the gameplay AND the graphics they will buy it and tell their friends and their friends will buy it and so on.\n\nThis game is truly promising. The only way to mess it up is to stop working on it. Please keep updating and improving this game and in time it will be a really innovative title.", "votes_down": 9, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501260724, "timestamp_created": 1501260724, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198057518454", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 154, "last_played": 1502230340, "playtime_forever": 217}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "33923605", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469745", "review": "bad to much\n", "votes_down": 13, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501492420, "timestamp_created": 1501492420, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198125075780", "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 63, "last_played": 1501413207, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
