It's just that.\n- Developer claims that this is for the communtiy, yet bans every kind of negative feedback (Early Access titels won't work if you ignore everything that people dislike).\n- Developer thinks that people writing negative reviews are haters.\n- I myself have been banned from the forums myself with this reason: https://i.imgur.com/aZnhe8o.png\nHere is the link that I had posted http://i.imgur.com/FG4ytMY.png\nYeah..... I'm most certainly some kind of hater. He also refuses to explain to me why I have been banned.\n- Horrible english spelling both ingame and in the update news. Just a hint: It's menu not men\u00fc, enemies not enemys.\n- He DMCA'd a YouTuber who released a negative review.\n- Dev uses alternative accounts to write positive reviews.\n- This is what the developer thought about the criticism. I quote:\n\n\"Also we get some criticism from people how tell us \"asset flipper\" and \"bad guys\", negative criticism makes us also better, \n we are young people on a big market like steam and haters gonna hate, \n but we will make a game for the community with the community, so if you wanna hate us, \n dont buy the game and search a other place to hate. \n Maybe come back in 6 month and take again a look on the game\"\n \nI think it is clear that this guy can't deal with people telling him that he did something bad, and as a \nresult he just does a whole lot of more bad by throwing out copyright strikes to YouTubers that have critique about his \"work\",\nbanning people from the forums that have critique and marking negative reviews as inappropiate.\n\nDear Developer, if you happen to read this, then I am here to tell you that negative feedback is also important. If you go ahead and tell me\nthat \"negative criticism makes us also better\", then why are you so hostile towards anyone giving you criticism?\nFeedback, postive and negative ones are both equally important. People who buy early access games are usually fully aware of the fact that the game\nisn't finished, but as a result of that, they will tell you about everything that they personally dislike. It's up to you to decide whether you will fix\nwhat displeases them in order to improve the game and make those people happy, or to find a different solution in case that you just have other plans and want\nsomething done on purpose. Banning everyone who gives you that negative feedback however will result in them making a quick refund and leaving a negative review.\nIf you want people to like your game, then you will have to make improvements. Since this is just an asset flip (you can't escape the truth) you will have to make a TON\nof improvements before this will become a game that people are willing to spend their money on. Stop pretending this to be some kind of \"Game for the community\" when you\nban everyone who gives you negative feedback. Yes, some people are just hating, but there are also some with legit concerns. Swinging the ban hammer either way just makes you look\ninmature and insecure. If you can't handle criticism, then you should leave the internet. Your friends will be the only one that will do you the favor of telling you that\nit's amazing even when it isn't, but people who have spent money on your game and don't know you personally will confront you with the brutal truth, and the truth is that you\njust asset flipped that game and there is a ton of things not good about it either.\n\n\nI conclude: You just want to get quick money. That's it. If you really wanted to make a good game, then you would actually listen to your community, but you choose to ban everyone giving negative feedback\nso that people looking at your game might not notice that something is wrong in the first place. Oh you greedy person.... But Valve is known for taking down games where the developer has upvoted himself\nvia a second account. I'll be looking forward to that day where this happens. If you truly believe that everyone giving negative feedback are just dumb haters and that you do this for the community,\nthen all you really do is fooling yourself.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505490280, "timestamp_created": 1505490280, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198029743548", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 197, "last_played": 1505486292, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 24, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
