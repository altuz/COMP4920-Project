Try this one.\n\n\nConsidering it is a indie game, there goes my analysis.\n\n\nLevel Graphics 10/10 - Really, really cool and immersive.\n\nSprite Graphics 6/10 - Could be better, both visuals and movement.\n\nGameplay 9/10 - Controls are fluid and responsive, but you can't aim your gun down.\n\nMusic 10/10 - Immersive, scaring and fits perfectly!\n\nSound effetcs 4/10 - Really poor, gun shots sound like bublegum bursting\n\nGeneral level and game concept 10/10 - You really feel on space!\n\n\nGame is mostly good, an old school feeling and some bits of good humor.\n\nThe only really bad thing about this game is the map, it's almost useless, not functional as in Metroid or Castlevania. Gives you no hint about where you really are.\n\nPS: DAMN MUTANT CHICKENS!\n\n\n\n", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504109944, "timestamp_created": 1504109944, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198038445569", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 11, "last_played": 1504258933, "playtime_forever": 433}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
