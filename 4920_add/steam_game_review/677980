But when I plugged in my USB Xbox controller, it simply wouldn't work. To elaborate on the keyboard controls, I can count the number of buttons on one hand but they still don't work very well. Arrows to move? Z to jump? I guess maybe the Z is because of the title, but that's a little silly to be honest. \n\nGameplay: Basically, you are a small blue man with a jetpack. That's kinda it. I'm personally not a fan of the time limit, especially because for most levels it's ridiculously short. And you never should have a game over screen for a game where you're expected to die so much. \n\nDifficulty: This game is really hard. I only beat a couple levels so far. The controls probably don't help, though. \n\nOverall, needs a bit more polish but I see a lot of potential in this.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502485936, "timestamp_created": 1502485936, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198077889168", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 1188, "last_played": 1503313257, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
