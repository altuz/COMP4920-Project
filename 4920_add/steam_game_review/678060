But Be Aware That it is Very Short, Only about 10-15 mins start to end. The Distruction is not that great as building dont become destroyed as you would expect, as you can demolish the whole first few floors of a building but the rest just hovers in the air. Would be more enjoyable if the building collapsed if you destroyed enough of it to see it tip over and destroy everything bellow it.

You can't move around the city. You sit in a small area and destory the things in the play field (a blue box around you) and once everything is destroyed, you move on to the next play field. Since you're a giant monster, you'll be squatting down majority of the time as well, which can be kinda rough. Other than that, theres not weight to your swings, the video shows stuff getting smashed in one hit, but that doesn't happen often in the game. You'll end up swatting at things a couple times just for it to fall to the ground instead of crumbling or flying. The people work kinda well, but they're oddly sized for everything you're destroying.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502737452, "timestamp_created": 1502737452, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197985194760", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 253, "last_played": 1502667590, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
