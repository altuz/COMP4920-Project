Although the graphics are simple, it works for what it is.  The controls are easy to learn and you can just jump in and play, but the tutorial portion of the game is always there in the begining which can be a little anoying wwhen you already know the controls, it makes you go through them each time. I hope the developer adds some really tall skyscrapers or bridges with construction, like lifting I-beams or equipement.  Inside the platform of the crane is very basic with no other interaction besides controlling the crane itself, would be nice to be able to use some of the buttons on the fuse boxto say start up the crane, or the elevator, maybe some alarms or safety switches, I dont know, make you have to start it up etc. There is a constant musical beat repeating in the background that gets very repetative quick, would be nice to be able to mute or change, perhaps add your own tracks from steam library. Also no way to end the game inside the game, no menu.  Thoes are a few things that I would say needs a little work, but the fun factor for me is the job simulator kinda game, your a crane operator loading and unloading containers on a cargo ship, with a time limit and money earnings...what can you buy with the money...not sure yet, maybe the developer will figure out something, but for now the money is your score :) So if you've ever wanted to be up in a crane picking up containers and moving them into position, this game is for you. As for replaying, sure I will try to beat my score with better precision and less damage and will continue to play if more areas are developed", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502289650, "timestamp_created": 1502289650, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198348017757", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 67, "last_played": 1502421783, "playtime_forever": 54}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
