Control ship speed to control the range of your shots/bombs, interesting level completion benchmarks, unique upgrade path system, etc.\n\nIt begins relatively simple, but I very quickly began to see the complex interactions between the different weapons on the ships, and how difficult they can make your life. Some of the setups forced me into a hit and run mechanic that pitted me against the clock, as you only get so many runs before they reach earth. My only complaint is that on a rare occasion I would be pushed to the edge of the map and pinned there, which isn't much fun in a game that is otherwise about non stop shooting action. But, each level is hand crafted in a way that forced me to approach it with a fresh strategy, and that kept me coming back for more punishment. \n\nOverall it's a good challenge with some fresh mechanics, well worth the price of admission.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1500842730, "timestamp_created": 1500842616, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197992573012", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 283, "last_played": 1500946795, "playtime_forever": 1947}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
