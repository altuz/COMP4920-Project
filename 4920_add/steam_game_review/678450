This game is in a pre-Alpha state. So many menus are just  place holders, your characters tongue is sticking out the side of his throat at all times, the AI is unable to find each other on most of the maps and the list goes on and on. This game should be less than a dollar while in early access if the creators are looking for a test bed for a completely broke game. I will eat my mouse cord if this game every reaches a \"proper\" release state. For those of you with thin skin or weak consitutions, don't watch my review. DO NOT BUY in this state. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Cze4yvJ1s", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505194560, "timestamp_created": 1505194560, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198030083302", "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 712, "last_played": 1505186467, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34986127", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509071", "review": "Well, this game isn't worth it's 15\u20ac price tag. First, you need to create an account in order to play the game. It took me 9 tries to make the verification link work. There are NO audio settings at all, and only a few graphical settings like resolution settings, windowed or fullscreen mode, vsync and anti aliasing. The graphics itself look very dated.\n\nThe maps are too big for the only handful of bots you spawn with and the AI itself is extremely dumb, standing most of the time just around or running stupidly across the map. The marker spread is ridiculous and the balls fly all over the place. The store to buy new equipment and customize your character are non functional. Oh and not to mention that NOBODY is playing this online. You'll find one server but it's just some bots playing on it, and I mentioned how bad the AI is.\n\nIn this post, http://www.fullonpaintball.com/community/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1490&start=10\none of the devs claimed in summer 2014, that the game's almost done. Nope it's not! Features are missing and some stuff is non functional.\n\nAlso, in this post here http://www.fullonpaintball.com/community/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1700#p1700\nthe dev claims that the game's in beta. It doesn't feel like a beta at all. More like a raw Alpha build.\n\nTerrible!
