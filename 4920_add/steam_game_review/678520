I loved the look and feel of the environments and the characters. The voices were great.\n\nThe novelty of being an unrestrained pervert was amusing but lets be honest, that's just a novelty. If we really wanted to get perverted in VR there are better outlets... Not that I have any first hand experience mind you... Seriously. Stop looking at me like that...\n\nOnce you get past the \"Oooh, pretty\" and the \"lol, wtf Japan\" you're pretty much left with a wave shooter. There really isn't any deeper gameplay mechanic to the game that I could find. Shoot the demons, shoot the girls, wash rinse repeat and move to the next position.\n\nCouple that with the headache the game was to get started... The game would launch but nothing would show up. I'd see the game try to launch in the HMD. The loading screen would be visible for about 30 seconds and then it would boot me to a blank white, generic Vive environment with no information as to what happened.\n\nOh, and the game would still be running so to fix the issue I had to close and reopen Steam...\n\nThe ultimate resolution was to put the .exe into compatibility mode for windows 7 (not sure if this is required or not) and to disable my antivirus.\n\nA $30 game shouldn't require you to turn your antivirus software off to run. This above all really hurts the games score for me. The first 2 hours of this game were nothing but failure to start, googling, getting nothing and trying random things. Several times I threw my hands up and said screw it, the games not worth it...\n\nIt's cute. It's funny. It's just not worth $30 for a wave shooter on top of the setup issues.\n\nIf you're a big ecchi anime buff it may be worth it. If not, you'll probably want to pass on this one.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506563748, "timestamp_created": 1506197822, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "steamid": "76561197983689849", "num_reviews": 92, "num_games_owned": 334, "last_played": 1506207630, "playtime_forever": 103}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34766992", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499554", "review": "This is one of the best FPS VR experiences you can buy as far as I am concerned. It's got tons of plot and depth as far as the eye can see. The future it now!!\n\nJokes aside the game is a lot of fun in VR, the HTC Vive (what I played it on)  makes it so easy to play and gives a really surreal Anime world experiance. It's a little jarring to be inside a classroom and feeling like you could sit at a chair and interact like it's all physical. The games simple to play and really enjoyable shooting game that will really suit anime fans that don't mind a little ecchi promiscuity. It is all in an amusing vain 'game experiance' and has a lot of charm to it that I bet a lot of people will enjoy in VR especially. \n\nThe game however makes me wish there was other VR games where you could interact with your favourite anime cast and visit some of the locales. Be awesome to walk around Tokyo from Durarara and watching the scenes unfold live in front of you.
