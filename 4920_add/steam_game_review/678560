I had a wonderful time, and have been playing non-stop for the last 5 days. The game is so immersive that it is hard to stop.\n\nWhat I love about this game is a preponderance of quests. Many of the quests are event / location based. When you are at a specific location, or talking to a specific person, and event will be triggered which advance the quest to the next stage. \n\nHowever, it is also possible to miss certain side quests. Some side quests might be disabled before/after you reach certain stages of the main quests. This is the tricky part as I have missed a few quests during my first playthrough. Currently I am nearing the ending stages of my first playthrough and I am taking down notes of the various events. This game is interesting enough for me to do a second playthrough, where I will try to learn all the ultimate skills, get all the ultimate weapons and armor and do all the possible sidequests. I know this is not going to be easy; however this game certainly is fun enough for me to try.\n\nCurrently this game is not available in English yet and you have to understand Chinese in order to play this game.\n\nI have about 10+ Chinese games on steam, and I highly recommend this particular game to anyone who can read Chinese and love RPGs.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504781260, "timestamp_created": 1504781047, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011891156", "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 759, "last_played": 1505012390, "playtime_forever": 4505}, "votes_up": 25, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
