I will however be picking it up and delving deeper when I recieve a new pad.\n\nDon't be fooled by it looking pretty basic, it's incredibly hard (as it should be) and rather than you feeling cheated, you're more likely to want to just keep trying and persevering with it. At least that's how I feel about it. Oh and things do get more colourful the further you go.\n\nHighly recommended for rogue-lite fans and anyone up for a challenge.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502754716, "timestamp_created": 1502754716, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198155118569", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 2206, "last_played": 1504482400, "playtime_forever": 81}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
