If you are not familiar with the genre here's a short description: walking simulators (or FPE, first person exploration games) put a lot of emphasis on walking instead of shooting (hence the missing word \"shooter\" from the name of the genre). The emphasis is on immersion and these games often showcase the capabilities of a particular engine and are relatively short (which explains why the price is significantly lower than that of an AAA game). They are slow-paced, have relaxing, atmospheric music and can usually be completed in an hour or two.\n\nAs the title suggests, the protagonist in his latest FPE is a deity himself. Similarly to the Nephise series a narration is done at regular intervals as we make progress throughout the 3 chapters the game offers. These chapters offer different landscapes, music and they take place at a different time of the day. My favourite was the 2nd chapter titled Moon which takes place at night and as we look up to the sky we can see a green moon and the constantly shining aurora borealis.\n\nThe game showcases the features of the 4th iteration of the Unreal engine. It is a bit too heavy on effects (e.g. shining grass) and it could have used a bit more water; the landscapes I now found more diverse and interesting than in previous titles of the creator. Also, there's more story here (do note the advanced level of English grammar here along with the excellent poems encountered regularly at statues) and, interestingly, 2 endgames depending on the choice we make.\n\nThis is a must-grab for those loving this genre as well as for those who are about to grab their first walking sim. You'll get a relaxing 2 hours and a game with 6 easy achievements.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505120370, "timestamp_created": 1505120370, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197986360343", "num_reviews": 335, "num_games_owned": 630, "last_played": 1505034519, "playtime_forever": 89}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34888274", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422562", "review": "Lovely game. \n\nThe story is short, but holds a lot of lore. \n\nThe gameplay consists of mostly walking, but there are a few \"collect items\" to progress and a few interactions here and there to keep you involved. Additionally, there are statues that contain optional lore to the intriguing story.\n\nThe level design is nice. It starts off rather plain, but as you venture forth, it evolves into an awesome landscape that conveys the story's direction perfectly. \n\nReccommended if you want a short interesting adventure.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505155618, "timestamp_created": 1505155618, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079603837", "num_reviews": 54, "num_games_owned": 521, "last_played": 1505155002, "playtime_forever": 49}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34916110", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504123", "review": "Another great little story, beautiful visuals, relaxing and a real joy to play through.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505294660, "timestamp_created": 1505294660, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970941771", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 327, "last_played": 1505294589, "playtime_forever": 366}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
