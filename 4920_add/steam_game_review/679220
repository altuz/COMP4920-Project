There are a lot of glitches with the speed booster, if your car barely even tilts and you are pressing the shift key aka the speed key, you will go flying and into outer space, as well as the game is way too bright, making it extremely hard to see, if you are reading this, developers, it would be a good idea to tone down how bright the tracks are. The game is an actually difficult racing game though. I find present day games to be way too easy, but that takes the fun out of the game. I like the game, keep fixing the bugs, I will start really playing this game when time scores are added because I really like speedrunning. Looking forward to the full release of this game!", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505689958, "timestamp_created": 1505689958, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198176916446", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 45, "last_played": 1506713370, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
