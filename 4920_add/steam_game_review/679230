While playing the first game, [i]Asher[/i] (which can be downloaded for free on the developer's blog), is not mandatory to play this stand-alone game, it can help get a stronger grip on the lore and the motivation of a couple characters, and I would recommend playing it beforehand of after your first ending. Now, onto [i]Tell a Demon[/i]. It is undoubtedly one of the strongest visual novels I\u2019ve played yet, both in terms of visuals and story. The art is totally unique, more reminiscent of paintings you would see in the 16th century section of a museum than classic VN art. I can\u2019t express how much I love the attention that went into little details in the sprites: sometimes the only observable alteration comes from a raised eyebrow or a bitten lip, and yet the change in expression is striking while conveying a subtle shift in emotion. The CGs are also phenomenal, but seeing as the video in this page gives a pretty good sample on what you can expect art-wise when playing [i]Tell a Demon[/i], I won\u2019t expand on the subject.\n\nI found the story to be extremely engaging, if maybe a little hard to get into on the first playthrough. There are a lot of characters that are only alluded to, dates and places that can easily get confused with each other and deities with several names each. However if you are willing to pay attention, this quickly becomes fascinating: the world-building is strong and coherent, taking some inspiration from classic horror stories (vampires and such) and yet revamping it into something truly unique: the Asher series revolve around the legend of an immortal-yet-dead Empress whose hubris created a cursed line of demons who continue to plague her country more than a century after her disappearance. In the present day, the player embodies three characters: a human girl - who sports a fabulous Louise Brooks bobbed haircut (did I mention the fashion is also great in this game) - aspiring to find a job far from her farming roots, as well as two vastly different, charismatic demons who must paradoxically learn how to change to stay true to themselves. The game enables you to influence both the outcome of their adventure - 16 endings, with a pretty satisfying balance kept between\u00a0\u2018\u2019happy\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019unhappy\u2019\u2019 ones - and their personality: this leads to a lot of variations and subtle changes in dialogue, which I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve yet seen all of even after nearly 20 hours of playing. There is also a healthy dose of compelling romance - both m/f and f/f -: just enough to be satisfied without getting overwhelmed.\n\nIn short, [i]Tell a Demon[/i] is a very intriguing, beautifully-crafted, expertly-written game, and I can only recommend all visual novels lovers and people who love artistic games to give it a go. I want to point out that it is not a horror game, so the most sensitive souls can stay reassured (there is some blood and creepy empty eyes though, you have been warned). Actually, [i]Tell a Demon[/i] succeeds in being as engrossing as a quality novel and aesthetically pleasing as a painting, and I can only hope that this will also be carried on within the third and final game in the series, [i]The Empress of Aeser[/i], which I\u2019m already waiting for with eagerness.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505419813, "timestamp_created": 1505407315, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198138967991", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 109, "last_played": 1505659759, "playtime_forever": 1330}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35091349", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "review": "I could write a very long explanation on why exactly I absolutely adore this vn, but I'll  keep it short.
