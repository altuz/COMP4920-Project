You can't choose your character name, which is pretty strange since you can even choose your gender, hair color, skin color and hair style.\n\n2. There is no mini-map, which is true, I didn't need it, but the only reason for that was:\n\n3. I accepted the 3rd quest from Van #2. It says he will cast a spell so lubo's hairs fall off when you kill them.
