I could barely see where I was moving sometimes\n- sounds are so annoying that I muted it in Windows after a few minutes\n- while it offers quite accurate pathfinding for this game type, my character often failed passing doors or simply stopped moving, endlessly showing a run animation\n- its insanely easy. At end of level 2 I had 4 of 6 inventory slots on flawless (purple) gear, a horribly cluttered inventory with no visible option to get rid of old gear, and only used one or two spells on the bosses\n- no mob ever used a single ability on me, all just ran into melee\n- the only quest type available are kill quests\n\nOverall, its current price of 8,99\u20ac is an insulting rippoff. Got it with a 90% coupon and it was still barely worth it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505840050, "timestamp_created": 1505840050, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198108729861", "num_reviews": 94, "num_games_owned": 228, "last_played": 1505839962, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
