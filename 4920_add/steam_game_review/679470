The characters in Balthus Requiem + Emo Natsu are supposed to be very over powered as they\nare the heros of yesterday and etc. So the battles are quick, the towns are sparce and the\ndialogue is rushed because they become way more important later on. As the game opens up very\nslowly like Game of Thrones, it starts to get better and better. But it sort of takes awhile :/.\n\nIf you only play Balthus Requiem to the first part of Chapter 1...you won't like it. But if you\nstick around and vanquish Sylph Cave, the game gets more rewarding. The hidden items and secrets\nappear like crazy. The jokes keep you entertained and the fights get more challenging and more\nfun. You have to really play your cards right to survive, but it does get easier as your characters\nnot only grow to become strong, but eventually they get stronger then the characters in Balthus Requiem.\n\nOnce you finish chapter 1; the plot thickens and the actual story of what the heck they are mean't\nto do unfolds. From this point on it starts to grab a hold of you and reel you in. You are rewarded with\nsellable items every new town you enter. The save points are at every resting lodge/Inn and every field.\nFrom Chapter 2 and so on you unlock the Weapon Shop, Armor Shop, Accessory Shop, and so on and so\nforth. They introduce fresh new items that alternate in stock as you reach new towns. Every time you unlock\na shop or finish unlocking all the items in said shop you get rewarded with items that make your journey easier.\nI found the characters cute and endearing. Although, some were sort of boring, I think\ntogether they had a realistic family bond going on for a band of rag-tag individuals.\n\nIn chapter 3 there is the fishing and fighting mini games which I found quite enjoyable. There was also this\ncard game that reminded me of a card game in ff8 that was hidden in a wall in chapter 2. There was also\nthese alter boys hidden in a priest's basement lol. It also had a mini game in which I was also offered drugs\nand played as someone called Big Beef Gai and was trying to feed people the Big Beef Sammich in a hallucination.\n\nAs you progress more and more things become available to you, things get harder as enemies level up\nwith you, and you have to gear up and learn new skills to stay ahead of the game. The main healer\ncomes around mid chapter 2 and it gets easier from then on out. Balthus does learn cure a little\nlater in chapter one though. There is secret bosses, secret dungeons, secret final weapons, secret quests.\nsecret unlockable characters and secret chests. Lots to explore. Past chapter 3 it starts to slow down again,\nbut by then you'll be so invested you'll hang on. Around chapter 5 you get hit with something fierce and it\nwraps it up beautifully with no stones left unturned in chapter 6.\n\nThen there is this end game resort where you can purchase every single playable character from the story and gear them up as you fight monsters in a dragon quest x like arena mode. All and all, a lot of effort went into this game. I honestly think that it deserves a chance. You will NOT like the very start as it's very unprofessional compared to the rest of\nthe game, but it's obvious to someone who has actually played the rest of the game. There is also a 90 page\nshort story sequel that finishes the entire series. If you really enjoyed the lore, I'd read it find out what\nhappens after you beat the game. The game is definately worth beating, but you can't just play up  untill chapter 1\nand expect the game to be like that the whole time, as it gets so much better.\n\nGraphically though, it's not all that great and it is pretty default, but honestly it really doesn't matter. It's so clear that a ton of effort and work has went into this game and most people who use rpg maker to make games aren't as crafty as most people in the game industry tend to be. When I take a step back and look at the bigger picture as a whole, I think\nI see a struggling developer who has spent an enourmous amount of time trying to get his story out into the world\nand deserves all the positive recognition he can get. Just give the game a chance and no...beating the prologue\nisn't giving it a chance. Game of Thrones sucked for many seasons, but when it came to season 6 and 7 the build up was\nso great that it exploded in such a fantastic way that it was ultimately enjoyable. But if all there was, was only\n5 seasons I would have dropped that show so long ago.\n\nThe point is you won't like it if you only play until chapter 1. But if you play chapter 2 and onwards then it's safe to say that in total; Solenars Edge Rebirth is a rare gem that shines bright in a sea of crap. I cannot wait to see more from\nthis developer.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506266013, "timestamp_created": 1506266013, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 889, "steamid": "76561198424996617", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 2, "last_played": 1506265370, "playtime_forever": 889}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
