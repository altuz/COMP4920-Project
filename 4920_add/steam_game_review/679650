Cool style, neat little story going on, and the kind of retro-tastic design and controls that make it the perfect kind of game for me. There's just one problem.\n\nThe game is broken.\n\nLike, I don't mean that in a salty way, I mean the game levels legitimately have unbeatable sections. During the \"REVERSE\" area, initially there was a gravity ball that was impossible to collect due to momentum from the falling player. I came back to the game a few weeks later and suddenly there was a platform under it. \n\nNow later in that same level, a section arises that seems to require the player to jump while the gravity is reversed, only the game doesn't let you jump in that situation. So you're just stuck scooting along the ceiling feebly for a while before deciding to quit. No, there's not another solution to the level. I suppose I'll just wait and see if there's an update in a while and try again.\n\nI want this game to be good, because it's got potential, but as long as I keep having to wait for updates to fix unbeatable levels, I can't really recommend.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503369007, "timestamp_created": 1503369007, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561197998451693", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 517, "last_played": 1506096812, "playtime_forever": 121}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34337383", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513207", "review": "As a platformer fan I love challenging platforming games. Super meat boy, N++, The End is Nigh, that's my shit. Seeing this I think to myself \"huh, this looks interesting\", The very cheap price tag made it seem even more intriguing, so I went in without some hope. Sadly I was let down. I'll divide this into sections to make it easier to read. \n\nGraphics - They're not really what I'd qualify as bad, you can see the lack of polish in them, but they're ok for a game like this. What caught my attention were the glitchy blocks which made the experience unpleasant because they're awful to look at and it's something that could easily be replaced with something else, since they're very distinguishable they could even be simply removed.\n\nMusic - Nothing to complain about here, for 1 euro I'd probably rather buy the soundtrack than the game in all honesty.\n\nGameplay - Well here's the core of the game's problem the mechanics, the gimmicks and the controls itself. The character feels very floppy, which from what I understand was done on purpose. I have no issue with that, I personally loved N++ which utilizes momentum into the gameplay. However this game doesn't utilize it as a fun thing to take care of, and it's simply an inconvenience, and a rather bothersome one at that especially considering some poor in my opinion game design choices. Such as putting damn spikes on the start of a screen which the player is unable to know about, and as soon as he sees them he has no control over the character and simply slides right into them. Then something I'd say was world 3 came around. I was in darkness all I had left of my character were red glowy eyes (visible on game's screens) WHICH DISAPPEARED after a few seconds. Ok I don't understand the concept of making shit invisible, it's really annoying and the complete disappearance is just testing my patience, that's where I gave up.\n\nStory - Something that seemed interesting, didn't get a chance to experience it to the utmost due to getting annoyed by the game design. Although I would mention some broken english, I'm not sure if it's something the developer overlooked or it gets worse later, as the first part was pretty well translated but there was a line that went something like this \"There are look like spikes\".\n\nOptions - There are none, the game doesn't run in full hd, it's capped at 60 frames (which is not that much of an issue but still a bummer), controller support ? forget it.\n\nTL;DR Interesting concept that went to waste due to weird game design choices I can't agree with, get the soundtrack if you want to support the game I guess", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503092909, "timestamp_created": 1503092909, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198060076751", "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 298, "last_played": 1503092016, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34088399", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495435", "review": "its indeed an unusual experience - who ever might think there is a sense of making a game that looks like 80s ms-dos combined with VHS glitches? but now i know i have a great sample to show kids how computers look before their birth :))\noverall - i recommend - properly done, clean, minimal, atmospheric", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502135175, "timestamp_created": 1502135175, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110829497", "num_reviews": 240, "num_games_owned": 2596, "last_played": 1502126099, "playtime_forever": 169}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34320444", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498813", "review": "This is a very interesting concept and a cool story,  but unfortunately the overall gameplay really lessens the whole thing.
