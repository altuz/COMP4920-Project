It's a relaxing (but not boring!) puzzle game where you swap tiles to lay out a path for your little hero. I love that you can choose from several classes for the protagonist, and buy new stuff for him/her with the gems you collect during the levels. All this gives SwapQuest much more personality than most puzzle games out there.

Sometimes the levels are a little bit too long for my taste, but I like the variety, you are always looking forward to the next one. Very much enjoying the atmosphere. \n\nGameplay is interesting, but it get tedious if you have to click too often in order to get your character move or collecting all jewels. However, over time you get very fast in swaping, so you will no longer struggle, but you need some skill to do so.\n\nIt's satisfying when your character gets very strong, while you know the average player would not collect so many jewels and fight so many monsters :]", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503705009, "timestamp_created": 1503705009, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198046820386", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 109, "last_played": 1503704382, "playtime_forever": 89}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
