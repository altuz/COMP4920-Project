You literally just click in 1-6 different parts of the screen as fast as you can. It only gets difficult when your hand starts to hurt because you have been moving and clicking your mouse for 10 minutes straight with no enjoyment. The only reason anyone would ever play this game is for the prize pool that the devs promised at week one of the game, which is scumy because it tricks people into buying a shitty game for the hopes of winning 100$. But whats really sketchy is that rather than having a leaderboard function built into the game, you have to send the dev screen shots of your score, so you can't confirm if someone really won or not. Please do not buy this game unless you want to win the prize money. I had more fun playing noob sqaud, because it was terrible in a good way. this is terrible in a bad way, but it is still presented as good by the devs.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504556338, "timestamp_created": 1504556338, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065218873", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 265, "last_played": 1504555959, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
