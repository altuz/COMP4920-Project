I needed about 40 hours to complete all 20 levels today, I had more fun than expected, but I don't feel like suggesting the game at the moment due to some very bad issues I experienced, here are my pros and cons:\n\n\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][u]CHARACTERS[/u]: Commandos features 6 characters with a specializations for each. I really loved this strategy, it forces to make them cooperate, making it impossible to complete the level with one character, despite 2 characters will usually be main in every level they are because they are more specialized than others. There are some linear puzzles, but you decide the strategy, you can use different characters to solve the same puzzles in different ways, you decide the way you like most.\n\n[*][u]MAPS[/u]: Commandos featured a good variability of settings, you play missions in a castle, a bridge, a railway station, a city, on roof, a harbor and more. I really appreciated they did not choose to use the same setting with different shapes and colors, almost every level is different than the others, everytime I had an overview of the new level, always made me want to play it more and more. Bringing curiosity like this is the key to make gamers keep playing and not give up, it worked very well on me.\n\n[*][u]VARIABILITY[/u]: As already explained, the game offers a lot of variability on your tactics. There are a few linear puzzles, but the game gives you several different ways to solve puzzles and win the level, the biggest is about going stealth or going loud, going through each character's specialization. You can interact with the environment and use objects like barrels, guns and vehicles to help your tactics.\n\n[*][u]LONGEVITY[/u]: Unless you played this game for years, it will keep you playing for a long time before you finally win the last level, I completed it in about 40 hours, which is an interesting time for such a old game. Each level can be solved in ten minutes up to several hours, Every level will literally ask you to play it to the end and beat it, and when you finally start the new level, it'll make you curious enough to start it. Despite the problems, I couldn't abandon the game, I wanted to play it to the end.\n\n\n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n\n[*][u]COMPATIBILITY[/u]: Probably the biggest problem is compatibility. I was lucky enough to play it without compatibility problems (win7 x64), but I read many problems with win10 and even with some 7s. Developers are aware of Win10 problems and I appreciate their topic to find a fix, unfortunately I will never understand why an old game should be rereleased and on sale on steam if it has some obvious compatibility problems, I believe if a game is too old, should be abandonware, if it's updated, can be on sale. Selling a very old game with so many incompatibility cases is enough to not suggest it, unfortunately.\n\n[*][u]LEVEL 4[/u]: Despite being lucky and not experience incompatibility issues, I had a very bad known bug while playing level 4. The game would crash on every savegame load and only work after dozen times trying. Beating that level was hell, I was about to give up in rage, I tried to use cheats at least for the last part to avoid further crashes (but cheats didn't work), eventually I just kept it crashing until I could finally make it, I spent at least 6 hours trying hard. The compatibility issues is already pretty bad, add a broken level at the beginning, that just kills the game, unless you have enough patience or rage to complete it.\n\n[*][u]INACCURACY[/u]: This game is the kind of game you need the best precision and accuracy for your tactics, you can literally lose the entire level for a pixel of difference. While I do like this kind of game, I expect its accuracy to be high enough to keep the flow, unfortunately it has some very bad inaccuracy issues that ruined hours of play. Beside inaccuracy on basic commands, I had my worse time with the enemies' dynamic field of view. I could hide bodies close to their field of views, 15 minutes later these enemies could spot the body, despite walking on a \"rail\" with the same FOV. That's because their sight moves, every \"lap\" they take has a different FOV and even a few pixels of difference can kill the game. I experienced the episode above and my last savegame was too late to move the bodies in time, I had to replay the entire levels a few times and waste hours of play. Another problem is the lack of information, sometimes you use decoy on enemies, some goes to it, some stand still and turn to it, you can stab some groups but can't do it to other groups, you have no idea about these differences until you test them. There should have been more accuracy for a game like this.\n\n[*][u]INTUITION[/u]: I already praised Commandos' variability, the dark side of it is all about intuition. Some solutions have no hints unless you find them with luck, there are no informations about buildings and enemies, hence you must try it first. Just a few examples with spoilers, the last level is impossible to begin, the only way to start it is climbing a wall of a castle with no hints you can climb it beside the change of icon. I had problems to understand how targets and building could be blown up, some don't explode with barrels and need dynamite, but again no hints or information about what to do or not to do, there could have been at least informations about buildings and groups.\n\n[*][u]HOTKEYS[/u]: I'll make it short and simple, the game is impossible without hotkeys. You can't play it entirely in a point and click mode, you must learn all weapons and hotkeys and use your keyboard as much as your mouse. While I didn't dislike the use of hotkeys at all, I didn't like how the game forced me to use them, and I had to use them very quickly to complete some levels. If you don't like fast hotkeys games, don't play this game.\n\n[*][u]SAVEGAMES[/u]: Commandos has a classic manual savegame mode, actually it's not a real con, but its inaccuracy killed the game and savegames. When my bodies were spotted 15 minutes later, I had no savegames that could make me move the corpses in time, making me lose the game. It's not a real problem, but it's way too easy to lose a savegame because of bugs, I had to use all the savegame slot to make sure to have enough checkpoints.\n\n\n[/list]\n\nFinal word: A very good classic precision strategy game, crippled by inaccuracy and shot in the head by incompatibility. Recommended only when fixed"}]}
