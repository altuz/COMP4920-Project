One can play almost without any H elements, treating it as a normal rpg.  Grinding has the dual advantage of increasing character power and earning more of the money you need each chapter to avoid a bad route.  If you're looking for H elements, they come online once the character is no longer a virgin, so losing a boss fight will speed that along.\n\nAs pointed out by other reviews, the translation is very poor.  At times dialogue is comlpetely unclear, and it is nowhere more amusing than during H scenes.  Particularly sound effects.  \"Poof! Poof! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!\" is an actual text panel in some scenes, presumably to represent grunting or other sound effects.  I laughed more than once. On the other hand, surrender all hope of understanding much more than the most basic brushstrokes of the story.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506372099, "timestamp_created": 1506372099, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1230, "steamid": "76561198424705252", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 9, "last_played": 1506937718, "playtime_forever": 1230}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
