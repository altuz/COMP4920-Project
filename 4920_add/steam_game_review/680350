I don't usually enjoy puzzle VR games, but the physics and simplicity of the game made it really fun. It is short, so the price tag makes sense. Though I do wish there more levels. The graphics are simple but very nice. The game feels very solid and the throwing is perfect.\n\nI did beat the game in about half an hour, I might go back and try to get some of the achievements, so maybe 1 hour total of gameplay. I so with there were more achievements and that they were easier to understand and more fun challenges. When it said beat it without trails, I thought it meant the blue trails on the ball. But I guess it meant the green trails from the  assists? Either way, I tried to get that achievement and couldn't figure out how to unlock it.\n\nAlso, maybe I got super lucky, but I beat the final level on my first try. Shouldn't it be harder? I sort of with there were some super extra hard bonus levels. Overall the game had a lot of really hard levels, but now that I got good at the game, I want more.\n\nFor the small price tag, I'd recommend it. A simple well made puzzle game that's also probably a good game for showing people vr for the first time.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506710315, "timestamp_created": 1506710315, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "steamid": "76561197979372009", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 58, "last_played": 1506739258, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
