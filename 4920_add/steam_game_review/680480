It was needlessly difficult, clunky, and obtuse and I gave up on it after a bit.\n\nFrostbite Edition fixes literally everything. Bugged dialogue, broken or wonky features, an adequate difficult range, interface fixes that are so massive it makes the game feel like a proper sequel. The combat system is really great, too, different but it services the game well. I never once felt unsatisfied whereas in the first iteration of ICY I absolutely hated combat, I avoided it at all costs and ended up uninstalling due to how user unfriendly it was. But in the Frostbite Edition I'd venture to say that I'm sad that I didn't get more game to play. The exploration, the quests, the characters, all of it was great!\n\nThe only thing I could think about being added is a genuine system dedicated to companions. Romances, friendships, rivalries. The individual bits and bobs about the characters are great, though the randomized nature of the game at times makes it seem like you can miss things before the final battle and, potentially, lose a companion you have kitted out with valuable gear.\n\nIt's an indie title with a lot of heart, great fun and an amazing story.

The man then comes out with a dead girl in his arms , asking to be killed. I ask him what had happened, he claimed that they killed his daughter, and they claim that he is the murderer. I decide to belive the \"murderer\" and attacked the group instead. turns out he was telling the turth. after I convinced him to join the my group and stoping his sucide. he went on to pervent several dissaters like the time all my group got high during a hiest and the guard gave us a bomb instead of the loot, he went and threw the bomb at the city and destoryed a big chunk of it. \n\n10/10 would get high again.\t[/spoiler]\n\n\nfor a person with not a high budget for games, I thought twice about buying a game I will finsih in one day. but it was well worth it. am going in for my second campagin now. \n\nYou can always try the demo, but I think the developers were too genrouse with it. I played 2 hours inside the demo and it still did not finsh. I was curious to see how far the game would go, but then I felt the ethical dilema of that and just bought the game since it gave me more than 2 hours on a demo. \n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504685333, "timestamp_created": 1504685333, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198056019664", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 72, "last_played": 1504730298, "playtime_forever": 928}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
