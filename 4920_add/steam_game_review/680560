I really did not want to put a no recommendation because this is such a great idea and from the video you can see that these guys put lots of time and effort into this.  However, I just can't recommend this experience in its current form.  The video quality is just not good enough.  \n\nYou can move around in the circle area and even jump.  You can look all around.  But the video 360 quality is just so poor that it's very difficult to enjoy the experience.  It's also a very cloudy day, so you mostly see clouds.  That could be exciting but not with such poor video quality.  It's really a shame.  I wanted to like this.  I won't ask for a refund.  But this is not worth anything really in it's current state.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502943709, "timestamp_created": 1502943709, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1502943329, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
