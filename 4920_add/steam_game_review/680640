Contrary to the other comments I like the gravity it kinda keeps me on my toes and makes the game more fun. I think the story is really cool of just being in a kitchen for a week, as well gives it a nice sense of realism besides the actual game itself. I think it is pretty insane the amount of equipment and food that was made for just one game as well. The attention to detail of all of the ingredients is really great and the design of the loft and kitchen is amazing. I also love the mini games within the game, it\u2019s kind of like a few games in one. I also find the simple act of chopping and slicing and following the instructions for a recipe to be weirdly relaxing and almost meditative lol. Overall I think it's got a lot of great stuff and I hope the dev keeps adding to it! An Itialian one would be pretty awesome too. Would love to make some pasta in VR!

The game was pretty easy to figure out, even with not really paying attention to the tutorials I was able to complete a few recipes without any problems (if you don't count dropping all the food as a problem). There seems to be a lot of different ingredients and ways to combine them, so much so that I could see people losing hours just trying out whatever recipes they could imagine.\n\nThe mechanics themself felt fun, though some aspects could definitely use some work. While I enjoyed cutting stuff up, it felt a bit difficult to hold things still to get good cuts (I ended up accidentally slicing an entire loaf of bread in half the wrong way). Luckily you aren't graded too badly for making these big mistakes. Interacting with all the different parts of the kitchen, using the stove and adding seasoning was all fun (though I had no idea how much of any spices I was actually adding, maybe actual cooks are better at judging that).\n\nThere's also a few fun extra, non chef related, activites to enjoy (but I wont spoil them). They provided a nice quick break if I felt overwhelmed with the cooking. I also enjoyed taking pictures of all the food I made (though I hate people that do that in real life). I created some pretty nice monstrosities.\n\nThis game is a very well put together VR experience, especially for what seems to be this studios first game. Sure there's a few bugs, but it looks like they're being addressed and I don't think I've played a VR game without bugs yet. I hope that this studio continues to add content to the game. Like others have said, different types of cuisine would be a fun new thing. I also think there could be some fun to be had in some form of multiplayer (especially if you can throw knives at each other). I rate this up there with the more enjoyable VR titles I've managed to play as of yet.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505741799, "timestamp_created": 1505682608, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198007623101", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 308, "last_played": 1505680152, "playtime_forever": 54}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34804833", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495091", "review": "It\u2019s a cooking experience for VR and an extremely fun one. I\u2019m a terrible cook in real life, but in ChefU I feel like a Michelin star badass.  Figuring out the controls is easy and the game does a great job of getting you familiar with the environment and the rules within it. You can learn what takes to run a restaurant in story mode, master your skills in timed mode or cause chaotic-fuckery in free play.  You gain a star rating out of 5 for how well you cook the recipe, which gives me a reason to come back and try again. The kitchen is designed beautifully but also intelligently.  There\u2019s a front of the house restaurant with people, a dart board and a pool table. I did noticed a bug or two, but it\u2019s a new VR game and it never impeded my enjoyment. There\u2019s plenty to do in the game and based on the way the world is set up, I can see the potential for TON of new content.\n\nThings I liked:\n-The ability to speed up/slow down time so you\u2019re not waiting around for you food to cook\n-Easy to learn/hard to master\n-Potential for DLC & developers who respond to feedback (*I\u2019d love to see a BBQ themed)\n-Throwing glasses at people\n\nThis game is the closest I\u2019ve ever come to feeling like I can cook something and for that reason 100% recommended it", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504828402, "timestamp_created": 1504828402, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001094127", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 28, "last_played": 1504810030, "playtime_forever": 216}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
