But this game is also developed by one person, which commends my respect. It requires a great deal of dedication to do this alone.\n\nSo what does this game have to offer?\n\nFirst of all, the building mechanics, albeit different, feel the same as in popular games like Evil Genius. Despite being a front to create a disease, the gimmick feels very much the same, which is a positive feat.\n\nThe game in its current state has enough content to keep you interested for a few hours in one sitting, with plenty of time to see what works for you. For me, that is trying to make floors departments, which is tricky to manage with limited money, but a fun challenge.\n\nAll in all, this gets my approval, and I can't wait to see what the developer will still produce.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506466598, "timestamp_created": 1506466598, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "steamid": "76561198004520862", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 173, "last_played": 1506114652, "playtime_forever": 214}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
