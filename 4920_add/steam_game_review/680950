They all look awesome and unique.\nWhether you wanna play in an old school 70's style bowling alley or relax inside a mansion under a chandelier.  There's so many.  I'm looking forward to the garage looking one with the Lamborghini parked next to you.\n\nNo multiplayer YET.\n\nI was looking through for Left handed option.  I couldn't find it!  I said, oh no...\nI bowled maybe 4 times in my life.  But holding the ball it feels a little small.  Am I wrong?  I wanna know what you people think!\nMaybe they can slightly upscale everything.  I don't know.\nI tried to make the ball curve/spin but hit gutters.  I think I can see it slightly curve.\nWhen I got 2 strikes in a row I was questioning myself.\n\n8 mins into a solo game and it crashed.\nI just restart because there is almost no loading times.\n\nEverything looks really good.  I just couldn't believe the left-hand option was missing.\n\nIt will definitely be interesting when multiplayer comes out.\n\nI know Pierhead Arcade has multiplayer bowling but the graphics on Let's Bowl just blow everything else away.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502604706, "timestamp_created": 1502603272, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197976314677", "num_reviews": 81, "num_games_owned": 743, "last_played": 1502603979, "playtime_forever": 38}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34320484", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510896", "review": "Looks great and has potential to be great. Currently EA here's a few things that would make it better:\n- Environments look great, but wish I could teleport around in them.\n- Needs a simple view reset (teleport would solve this) hitting my couch on my follow through. \n- Annoying tablet is always attached to left hand, need a way to hide.\n- Wish I could make a fist, be able to pick up bottles ala Sportsbar.\n- Needs in-game SS adjustments\n- Music is terrible, doesn't fit its great visual sytle.\n- Wish the score was kept on those cool-looking scoreboards in the environment.\n- Also tried on Rift but no luck, can't get past first menu. Touch controls feel more natural for bowling.\nLots of great potential here, excited to see it finished.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503029232, "timestamp_created": 1503029106, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198278904140", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 146, "last_played": 1503291705, "playtime_forever": 28}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
