From functional mechanics, a complete storyline, believeable characterizations and visible effects of player actions, this is a complete package that knows what it wants to achieve and ends when it has done so. It is game design done right.\n\nHeadliner is simple to pick up, fast to complete, and yet entices you to come back for a new quick playthrough by being more fun and thought provoking than dozens of titles out there. \n\nWith its multiple endings, engrossing story, functional mechanics and cheap price, I find the game well worth my money.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507134751, "timestamp_created": 1507134583, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "steamid": "76561198326953474", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 31, "last_played": 1507132877, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35480173", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "A Celebrity Died - Police drones were everywhere -  Daughter got a scholarship -  Wife was happy -  People listened to my news.\nLovely game.
