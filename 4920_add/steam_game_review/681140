The spiders gets super boring in the end from how repetetive it is which ends with the game not even being challenging. \n\nAdd more weapons or buffs that works properly. The mines doesnt explode properly and sometimes they just disappear and the spider doesn't get hurt at all. Also when you kill them, sometimes the spiders doesn't even drop gold at all which could be frustrating if you want anything to change in the screen. \n\nThis game is very glitchy and is not worth paying even with just 10 cents. There is games that are free which has the same mechanics but has more enjoyable playstyles. Only reason I can see someone buying this game is to just fill their library with quantity of games instead of quality. \n\nIf you are here for the achivevements. Use an autoclicker to keep yourself away from the pain in the wrist from clicking too much. \nIts not rewarding enough to even want to play the game properly. You just want it done and after reading other people's reviews, comments etc. I can agree that its annoyingly long to recieve the achievements and its not worth doing it for hours straight.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505234322, "timestamp_created": 1505234322, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198081840750", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 976, "last_played": 1505246381, "playtime_forever": 260}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34774786", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489374", "review": "i hate myself", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504701764, "timestamp_created": 1504701764, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198079237560", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 63, "last_played": 1505209770, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35033969", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490897", "review": "fuck you assholes this is the greatest game to come to the fps industry for years", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505685173, "timestamp_created": 1505685173, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066385588", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 64, "last_played": 1505618413, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
