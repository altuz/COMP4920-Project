Nice 1st effort by this Dev. Be aware though, that the difficulty level leans toward the very easy to medium end of the scale. No tough ones, really. Also, the game states 33 puzzles - well, you'll burn through those instantly. SEE EDIT And Yes, I wish there was an endless puzzle generator. EZ 100% Achievement, and nice English & Cyrillic alphabets for Profile pages. I don't see much replayability here, with so few puzzles. Even at 99\u00a2, you'd like more content. This one gets a 'Thumbs Up' - Cheers\n\nEDIT:12SEP2017 - Dev added free DLC +10 Achieves - LOVE IT !

But it isn't, and it offers basically nothing more than an usual Sudoku book you can find everywhere in shops, supermarkets and so on.\nBasically, this game consists only of 30 (and some DLC more) classic Sudoku puzzles.\nControls are quite crappy, and limited to mouse only; there are no option/configuration pages and you have to deal with big Sudoku puzzles only with clicking from 1 to 9 cyclically - left mouse goes 1, 2, 3, right mouse button goes the contrary. Stop, no other controls. And the hitboxes are really strange, like, you have to click in the centre of the number.. it's very badly designed..\nSo, really, this game is a plain and simple collection of Sudoku puzzles that also you can find everywhere as smartphopne free apps and so on, if you don't like pen and paper.\nIt isn't worth the money.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507206264, "timestamp_created": 1507206264, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "num_reviews": 115, "num_games_owned": 225, "last_played": 1507207240, "playtime_forever": 46}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
