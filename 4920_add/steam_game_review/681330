A smaller, more refined attempt rather than featuring dozens of specific zones to explore and trade in. It is sadly more simplified though, where sending ships to automatically trade instead makes them sell to all stations within a Sector who are willing to buy, instead of setting a single station to manually trade with. But it adds its own level of complexity to ship systems. You can disable engines, weapons, power. You don't need to destroy a ship to win the fight. Movement feels good, combat feels good. There's not much more to say here. Its good.\n\nThe AI: If any of us have played the X games then we should all know the AI is terrible in those. I've been pleasantly surprised by Helium Rains AI pathways. Auto-Docking is cleaner than i ever could have thought possible. Though bugs do persist that requires me to manually dock sometimes.\n\nResponsive Developers - As far as I have seen the development team appear responsive to suggestions and tweaks. It is always nice to see an Early Access game that is cared for publicly.\n\nCons:\n\nExploration - Rather than going through Warp Gates to reach zones, you instead 'Fast Forward' after selecting a spot orbiting one of the four planetoids in the Menu. It can feel as though it is removing you from the flow of the game as days pass by in-game before you reach your destination but for you it is merely 1 second per day. It feels too much like teleportation since you can do it from any area to any discovered zone. It takes seconds to reach the other side of colonized space, causing this sensation of disconnection with events in-game.\n\nThe Menus - Though the UI is certainly well designed and easy to navigate, half of your time will be spent inside of it. This also suffers from taking you out of the perspective of the Universe. The game feels almost half like an Information terminal sometimes. Watch gameplay of Helium Rain and you will see a Window taking up the entire screen with text more often than you would think. Not a con if you like this terminal-focussed gameplay, but for me it can become frustrating not knowing whats going on around me while im inside of it. (The game continues in real-time when you open it up)\n\nStar System design - The trailer and screenshots shown tend to focus on the handful of Zones that genuinely look breathtaking. But these are far and in-between. Most of the regions you will explore look barren, with only the odd few asteroids to give aesthetics. Along with this, these systems tend to have the Stations clumped together in close clusters. Giving the impression that these were rushed into creation to get the economy up and running first, aesthetics later.\n\nFactions: Each Company in the game has a monopoly on their chosen industry. You are the new comer, someone who can choose which industry to focus on and act competitively against one of the Dominant Corporations. There exists a reputation system, which I tend to love in Video Games. But I dont feel it is handled well in Helium Rain. There are no set rivals for each company, aside from Pirates. I haven't waged war yet to see if it affects reputation, but I feel it is a large miss for reputation to not be dynamic. If you want to be cosy with one faction then another should totally begin to hate you for it.  You could go the entire game being neutral to all and friendly with some and face no consequences. But that's just my opinion. I liked how Freelancer handled it is all. You simply couldn't be neutral with everyone at once, someone will always hate your guts, which kept things dynamic.\n\nEconomy - Speaking of the Economy, it leaves much to be desired in its current state. I have found simply saving up for a large transport and then buying a full cargo of water and parking it in a Sector that consumes the most of it for trading can make the entire purpose behind the games ability to buy stations and wage wars completely mute. With 2k a day in profits, you can simply click the Fast-Forward button and leave it at that. Gaining a hundred thousand within 50 seconds. You simply do not need to do anything else to make money. And if you really wanted to abuse the economy, you could repeat this step by buying more transports and selling resources where they are most consumed over time, your supplies will always be bought first so there's no need to worry about the AI selling them before you. The game has a very unbalanced economy and the existence of a fast forward mechanic seems to work against the premise of doing missions and undercutting your competition as you will simply only be doing them for the early game. It is just not worth doing anything other than sitting through the fast forward process because the Time Wasted versus Profits Gained ratio is so far out of scale that its just more beneficial to just not bother at all. Building stations in fact act more as a drain to your income than an actual benefit.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all the game is still early in development and these are issues that can and likely will be fixed given enough time. I'd completely recommend the game in its current state as long as you enter into it with a refusal to abuse the economy and take all the fun out of it.
