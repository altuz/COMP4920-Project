The most basic zombies are bullet sponges, not to mention the higher level enemies. Add to that the fact that there are massive numbers of them, too many for the fairly small maps to hold, so they tend to move in tightly packed clusters of anywhere from 5-6 to 20+ zombies. This isn't a huge deal on the levels where you can just run away from them as you shoot, but once you get to the \"defend the gate\" stage it can literally turn into a dogpile that builds faster than you can kill.\n\n\nAmmo is fairly scarce, even with copious use of melee weapons, the only real way to get a usable amount of it is to purchase it from the shop in between rounds, but they barely give you enough time. And finally the bosses, they're basically invincible, I get they're supposed to be stong and all, but they have no mechanics, you just kite them around and dump clip after clip after clip into them, and melee weapons are not viable, meaning if you managed your ammo poorly you have zero options.\n\n\nIt's not expensive, and it is pretty fun, but these issues are frustrating. overall if there were more difficulty options I would definitely recommend it, but in it's current state its not really worth playing in my opinion.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505081574, "timestamp_created": 1505081509, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197997767492", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 54, "last_played": 1505079797, "playtime_forever": 379}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34940660", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499343", "review": "I don't get all the positive reviews .
