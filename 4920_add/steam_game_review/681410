Very adorable concept and I am a sucker for the retro look and clean premise (clean meaning no sex, drugs, or other filler that distracts the player from the actual game content.) When it was released, I saw it was only 0.89...I would have paid a few bucks for it but I had no prob with this price either. \n\nIt says 1.5 hours of gameplay but I am not that clever at these types of games so I have played almost 2 hours to get to around level 25. Either way, it was nice to buy a decent game (decent in quality but mainly in appropriateness) from an indie and support something other than a AAA title for a change. I will be looking for other indie gems that are family safe and I will vote with my dollars.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503212383, "timestamp_created": 1503212347, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052287490", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 8, "last_played": 1505248470, "playtime_forever": 199}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
