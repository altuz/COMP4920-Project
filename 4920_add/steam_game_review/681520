This isn't a bad thing, it's a clean game world and it's quite relaxing with the sea, the sunshine, the sound of the waves and the incidental meditational soundtrack.  Unlike The Talos Principle this game relies a bit more on platform elements which is fun and you can complete each puzzle in ways that aren't quite so linear and obvious i.e. a wall thrown block onto a pressure pad or a well placed block on a ledge in front of a laser beam.  Sometimes I'll think \"Was that the way the puzzle was supposed to be solved or did I just game the system?\".  Anyway the puzzles get you thinking but aren't too hard and you progress in a linear fashion (no back tracking if you aren't a fan of having to do that) without any sudden and sharp ramping up in complexity.  It's the puzzle game equivalent of easing into a warm bath.  Overall I'd say it's a nice little challenge that I think you'd enjoy if you're familiar with The Talos Principle and want something similar or even gave up on The Talos Principle as too hard.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505385821, "timestamp_created": 1505385821, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198317335512", "num_reviews": 10, "num_games_owned": 256, "last_played": 1505554215, "playtime_forever": 340}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
