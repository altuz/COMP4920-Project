Taking cues from crypt of the necrodancer, Noisz involves tapping to the beat to perform actions. Like CotN, this forces you to make quick decisions on the fly (in this case, shield or hit). However, that's about where CotN ended being a rhythm game. This takes it one step further and creates bullet patterns that express the music. \n\nThere's a lot of potential here already, and in the few songs there are, even on easy modes, the potential is already being met. \n\nWhile the art style is fairly clunky, the game lags a bit on my computer, and there's no visual indicator as to the beat that a lot of rhythm games have, what's there is still incredibly solid, and it really can only go up from here. \n\n$15 may still be a bit steep at this stage, but there is plenty there for both hardcore rhythm gamers/shmuppers who can work on perfecting scores, to newbies who can slowly work their way up to getting better.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505890394, "timestamp_created": 1505890394, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 106, "steamid": "76561198008677658", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 264, "last_played": 1506312698, "playtime_forever": 155}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35191711", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Fun and challenging.

It is the best rhythm genre mash-ups I've ever played. A lot of them just feel just like a different genre with nothing rhythm game about them besides doing something to the beat. NOISZ feels like an arcade rhythm game though and through from the boss patterns, scoring and ranking, difficulty modes, and more. Its more a shooting game than a rhythm game, but it is so so so obvious its made by a team of rhythm game developers.\n\nThe shooting game aspect is really accessable too. No matter how much you get hit you never get kicked to the title screen (accept for the hardest difficulty) so you always get to enjoy the whole song and practice all of the patterns. It has a bullet absorbing mechanic that lets you chose to make a lots of patterns way easier if you need to (and plays into scoring in a fun way too). And being set to music makes it so so so much easier to memorize boss patterns when its needed.\n\nI'd recomend this to anyone who likes arcade style games. Its just really good.\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506221543, "timestamp_created": 1506221543, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 506, "steamid": "76561197973021625", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 196, "last_played": 1507172263, "playtime_forever": 709}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
