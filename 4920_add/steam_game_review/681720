Hopefully they could add more characters for you to play as since it seems they will sticking to one style for the game! This is truly an amazing sandbox/platformer! \n\nSome things that would make this game amazing though I think are unlikely\n1. A form of Multiplayer.\n2. A race a ghost of player mode.\n3. More Backdrops and Block Themes for spice levels up a bit.\n4.

One particular level made by the devs really shows this \"Good Author\". Another huge thing is the complete randomness in difficulty when picking easy, normal, or hard 100 man challenges (yes they did that). Also a lack of maps but still enough to have some fun once you learn the physics. I hope the devs do something soon.
