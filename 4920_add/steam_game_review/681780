Well collect 10 Blueprints. Why? Dont know sorry.\nGame wont tell your progress in this \"quest\" so keep track of how many you have collected your self. (I bet its impossible to find em all anyways)\nYou cant run, but there is a stamina bar in the bottom of the screen, i guess its for decoration only.\nI THINK there was 1 or 2 jumpscares, well the sound did something but I never saw anything.\nThere are no starter menu, you just play right away.\nYou have seen this invironment many times before if you have played just a few Indie horror games.\nOh yea also, if you run out of batteries, while looking for these blueprint you dont know what is for, you are screwed, cause you cant see. \n\nI think that is all.
