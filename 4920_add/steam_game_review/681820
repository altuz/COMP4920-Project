The memories I had with this game was unforgetable, it surely explained a beautiful stories and showed me well wtritted characters. \n\nEven I vote for yes, I strongly not recommend you guys buying this game, it is absolutely not worth 6 bucks, but as long as this game comes out anytime, I'll keep buying it!!!!\n\nI got plan to translate whole game into english version, so even the game itself is not that good at all----bad animation, ugly environment build up, poorly made sub-class mission, etc. But the story, best story of whole Chinese Paladin series. So I want other foreign players like me could enjoy this game like I do once I make it into english version.\n\nFinally, if you are chinese, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, UNLESS U ARE LIKE ME! And for foreign players, strongly recommend you guys try this game once the english sub comes out, is one of the best ways to experience how beautiful it could be as a Chinese Final Fantasy game.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "9", "votes_funny": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504604520, "timestamp_created": 1504604257, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 518, "steamid": "76561198064434466", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 112, "last_played": 1506579367, "playtime_forever": 1122}, "votes_up": 32, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34836337", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505354", "review": "My friend \u3042\u304b\u308a\u3093(Akarin) recommended \u4ed9\u5251\u5947\u4fa0\u4f20\u56db-Chinese Paladin 4 was released on steam, I tried playing it.\n\nSince this game was originally released in 2007, It has been just ten years ago from now.\n\nso, there are problems such as not being able to display full screen due to resolution problem.\n\nThere are setting items that can display full screen, however selecting it makes it possible to see the scanning line, I am not able to play very much.\n\nIt is not translated into English, so it may be hard to play for those who can not read Chinese character like me :,-(\n\nThe content is based on the story of ancient China so it is very interesting.\n\nI think that you are able to enjoy it, if you are able to understand Chinese characters.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504960538, "timestamp_created": 1504960417, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198352765262", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 5, "last_played": 1505260084, "playtime_forever": 323}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35420583", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "review": "Classic", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506957744, "timestamp_created": 1506957744, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 251, "steamid": "76561198054143465", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 57, "last_played": 1507209040, "playtime_forever": 261}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34774094", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500921", "review": "\u82f1\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u5b57\u4e71\u7801", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504699107, "timestamp_created": 1504699107, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198194298311", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 37, "last_played": 1505095234, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34757688", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489205", "review": "It is an excellent game, it is a miracle of Chinese computer game.\n\nFirst of all, it is hard to imagine Softstar (Shanghai) can use only  6 million yuan (no more than 1 milliom US Dollars) to finish this game.
