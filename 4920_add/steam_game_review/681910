You have limited moves of course, points for every level and hints.. it can be really difficult some times, even because these kind of puzzles usually have a rectangular/square-like grid while this one has different designs carved into a rectangle for every level, so you never have to make a square or a rectangle with your pieces but other \"solids\".\nI saw that the developers added more levels recently too.\nReally relaxing and recommended :)", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506254106, "timestamp_created": 1506254106, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "num_reviews": 115, "num_games_owned": 225, "last_played": 1506429868, "playtime_forever": 142}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34922339", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "review": "Fun and hard little game.
