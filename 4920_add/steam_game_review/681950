This game is better than it looks.  More fun and more challenging as well...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krDybK3RmG0\n\nEasily worth its asking price of 99 cents, I put over an hour into this unique little indie game the first time I launched it.. and that is RARE for me to do with ANY game here on Steam, even big budget games.  That should tell you something!  But then again, I always have had a fondness for developers who don't simply toss up asset flips or low effort crap and put a 99 cent price tag on it.  No memes here, sorry kiddies.  No sexual references or images of bouncy cleavage, sorry pervs.  Instead what we have is probably the most unique game I think I've played in my 35 years of gaming.  While it's not going to make game of the year, it is easily worth your dollar and offers enough challenge to make you holler!  ;-)\n\nMy \"First Play on Launch Day\" initial scoring:  \n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nVALUE: For a dollar, if you don't think you can ever get an hours worth of gameplay out of this little gem, then I'd tell you to try roaming away from the hordes of sheep and AAA pretty glamour games once in a while and open your mind.  ..Just sayin'  Easy 40 value here.\n\nFUN: It takes a few minutes to get the hang of what's going on and a little longer to figure out how to control yourself, and probably much longer to \"git gud\" at controlling yourself and your shots, but there is a good amount of fun and challenge offered here.  21 out of 30.\n\nCONTROLS & BUGS:  This game just goes to show that good games with solid controls and few bugs CAN be made and sold for the cheaps by using the free version of Unity.  A few minor bugs like the image of your astronaut clipping through the planets at times, but nothing that makes your gameplay suffer.  18 out of 20 points scored here.\n\nGRAPHICS & SOUND:  By far the least important aspect in my scoring criteria, this game just proves yet again that AAA amazing graphics and a $60 price tag aren't required to have fun with a game.  The graphics and sound works just fine here, and the ambient music is perfect for this type of a game.  6 out of 10 points.\n\nMy SCORE:  (40 + 21 + 18 + 6) equals an impressive 85%.  Nice game for your first game ever Mr developer.  Well done and I look forward to your next game!  :-)", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506134109, "timestamp_created": 1506133533, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "last_played": 1506137663, "playtime_forever": 85}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
