I admit, it cuts it a little close, but it still fell on the positive side.\n\nIt's a short game; one full run took me an hour to finish. I found the main character quite likeable, and I enjoy playing as mothers on a quest (Fallout 4, don't interact). There's quite a lot of descriptions for items laying around, and they all show Nalia's personality quite well.\n\nThe game is, admittedly, not outstanding visually; it seems to be assembled from asset kits. It didn't bother me, personally. Its main draw is the plot; it's the way you interact with characters pushes the story forward. I found that it has more to do with a visual novel than an RPG. Gameplay-wise, it seems to be a standard RPG Maker game: walking, interacting with people and items, and choosing actions. (There might be contextual spoilers in the paragaph below.) \n\nThe first part of the game had a very good atmosphere - I bought it right after laying the demo. Creepy isolated building! Mysterious monsters! Secrets! That's my jam! Unfortunately, I found the reveal of the mystery to be unsatisfying; I can't judge for others, but it's a trope I am personally very tired of, to the point of rolling my eyes and throwing another new piece of media that uses it on the giant pile behind me, and I was less engaged with the game after that. It also makes the replay value low for me, because I'm not interested in aiding the other side.\n\nI found the worldbuilding to be very promising; I was immediately fond of Nalia; the atmosphere suggested a murder mystery; finding out that the rest of the game is going to be This Thing\u2122 again was very disappointing. I feel like there are so many more stories to be told in this setting. I think it would support a bigger game quite well. \n\nPros: \n- Not very expensive; free demo available on itch.io\n- A lot of dialogue options for the protag; a lot of item interaction text\n- Interesting atmosphere and worldbuilding\n- Multiple endings to collect\n- Likeable protagonist\n- Authors' first game; a lot of potential, a lot of room for improvement\n- Characters are quite vbrant\n\nCons:\n- Grammatical errors, typos - the authors of the game are ESLs, so I overlooked an odd construction here or a word that doesn't quite match there, but there's also a lot of typos that were clearly the result of not proofreading, and that annoyed me much more. \n- Little dedicated artwork\n- Plot twist doesn't live up to the potential of the atmosphere, in my opinion\n\nFinal verdict: though the game disappointed me somewhat, I don't regret buying it - it's been a long while since I've had the strenght to finish a game, and finding something that interested me right off the bat, even if it didn't end up as strong as it started, still makes me feel very positive towards it. It has a lot of good ideas, and executed its story well, but lacks the final polish. I see a lot of potential, and I'd be interested in checking out a new game by this studio, improved by their experiences and with received feedback.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1501975797, "timestamp_created": 1501972589, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025460438", "num_reviews": 13, "num_games_owned": 104, "last_played": 1501975689, "playtime_forever": 116}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34039840", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509750", "review": "I really liked the little details, and how some choices were actually tough.

Gathering the clues, realising how they intersect to create the bigger picture and figuring out how to fight enemies without dying is fun.\n- Battles require you to pay attention to what others say in order to pass. Something about having to dig up clues on the enemies you face in order to beat them is nice. Whether it be learning that an enemy has a weak side or that they'll do a particular type of move can really help you pay attention and engage with the game. I even liked that you had choices to make instead of typical JRPG battle system, and that some choices only appeared if you had a specific item or piece of information.\n\n\n=Bad=\n- There were a lot of problems when it came to the writing. For the most part it's quite decent, but there's a lot of places through-out where it's stilted or has bad grammar. This is a big issue when the game is so dependant on the dialogue and descriptions to move you forward. Thankfully, what is written is understandable, but it could definitely be a lot more polished, especially for a commercial game.\n- Graphics are a bit hit and miss at times. For the most part, the RTP and other tiles are used well enough to convey the areas, but there are some times where it's questionable in its use. For example, walking on the cliff tiles to get to the cave was a really bad choice. Some areas look great but it would be nice if a bit more polish were added to the maps to make them look better, again, especially for a commercial release.\n\n\nThere were a lot of features that were just 'okay'. The interaction with Samson, for example, ended up leading nowhere. There was also an issue where I was supposed to have unlocked an ending but didn't (the Trail of Blood. I'd found the ring and the two other bloody bits (axe and dress), then talked to that person where you were supposed to. :/ )\n\nI would have liked to have seen the game have a bit more length for the price tag, but overall it's decent fare for RPG Maker commercial. Better than a lot of commercial RM games but not something I'd bother to play again or say someone must absolutely buy. \n\nGood job, dev-chan. I hope to see you revisit and fix up the issues the game has in order to make it a more complete and polished experience.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502453811, "timestamp_created": 1502435614, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198052909961", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 320, "last_played": 1502434776, "playtime_forever": 109}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34255976", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "I thoroughly enjoyed this game!

It's obvious the devs were aiming for a narrative-centric game.  The reason why they didn't include a RPG combat system is because that would compete with the narrative. \n\nHaving finished all the endings, I'm not sure if all the answers neatly tie together, but you learn enough about the characters to see how they fit in the larger setting. \n\nThe reveal wasn't really interesting in itself, but there were some good moral choices towards the end. The whole scenario/dilemmas fit well with the protagonist, Nalia. The game highlights the fact that every choice is a conscious one. There's no \"oh I went up against the villain because that's just how story goes.\" Having to bear the weight of every decision might just be enough to cause you a bit of ... moral anxiety.\n\nIt's a short game and obviously there are limitations.
