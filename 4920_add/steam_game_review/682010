I appreciate that it's an indie project, but the game is incredibly rough and unfinished. I'd love to see something better than the current audio loop (pretty short for a loop), the game has several bugs (tooltips not going away, no fullscreen option in sight, randomly going to main menu, characters not dying, infinite games, game goes crazy when you lose). I would reccomend this game because it's unique and cool, but the gameplay is repetitive, glitchy, confusing, and simply unfinished. It really doesn't make sense why half of the things that happen in this game occur, and there isn't much explanation in-game.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506181472, "timestamp_created": 1506177908, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 121, "steamid": "76561198080782175", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 151, "last_played": 1506201760, "playtime_forever": 121}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
