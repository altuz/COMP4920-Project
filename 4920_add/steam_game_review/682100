The monsters really, REALLY want you dead - and you have to take them out quickly and precisely in order to survive, which made it a rather intense experience. The levels are pretty small, but well designed (and packed full of enemies). It ran really well, looked good and had a nice atmosphere to it. It took me a bit over an hour to beat it, and while that might seem short, I actually felt that it was the right length for it.
