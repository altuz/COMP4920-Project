The themed sets are great, and I would definitely love to see more of them added in. There's nothing extremely difficult, the hardest puzzles take about 10 minutes to put together. Right now, the puzzles are designed to be relaxing, but it'd be cool to have additional optional goals like using as few words as possible. That way, there's incentive to play older puzzles.\n\n\nThe dailies are fun, and with 3 different board sizes everyday, it makes sure anyone can go into this game anytime and always have something new.\n\nThe bonus Quads minigame is fun and worth the money on its own. It's essentially a cross between Boggle and 2048. Even if you have the main game finished, coming back to Quads and trying to beat your high score is a great way to spend time.\n\nOne thing I'd like to see is the implementation of Steam workshop. It'd be very cool to create and submit my own puzzle sets, which would be beneficial for people who've completed the main game.\n\nOverall, a relaxing and enjoyable experience (even if it made me hate the letters Y and K just a little bit more.)

Two people will almost certainly have different solutions to a puzzle, depending on what words they know and what comes to mind first. Each puzzle is pretty short, and there are different sized daily puzzles to tackle depending on how much time you have available. Even small puzzles can be difficult depending on the letter composition, though.\n\nOne complaint I have is that the dictionary isn't very strict in the game. There are a lot of words that feel cheap to use but are pretty useful, and you can get a lot of 3 letter combinations by trial and error until a permittied one comes up that wouldn't be found in most dictionaries.
