Would love to see 4 player couch versus added and can't wait to see future genders.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhzxKAeAAVQ&feature=share", "votes_down": 9, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504961318, "timestamp_created": 1504961318, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198001876420", "num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 552, "last_played": 1504824246, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
