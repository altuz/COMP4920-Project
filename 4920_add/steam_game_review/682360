The graphics are fair, but there aren't even effects for shooting anything.  The bullets just dissapear into whatever your shooting at.  I had no clue how to play this game at first.  I couldn't reload or figure anything else out without trial in error.  You'll see what I mean in the video.  The default language is in Chinese and it wasn't initially clear how to change it because the menu was in Chinese!  There are certain buildings that make movement very jittery and seem like the FPS dropped even though it hasn't.  The initial load time is also long.  There are just way too many issues with this game, it's not even early access.I am not going to say it's 100% the game developer's fault it froze because it COULD be my hdmi to displayport cable.  I have just ordered a new mini displayport to displayport cord to figure out if it's on my end that i've had a few games freeze on me often recently.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502579795, "timestamp_created": 1502577618, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053682704", "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 61, "last_played": 1502577267, "playtime_forever": 34}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34211290", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519636", "review": "I have to start with a positive: the concept is a good one. Rescuing people who trapped in a prison overrun by zombies is a cool idea. The problem with this game is the execution. From the start it doesn't even let you choose the language before you enter the game; luckily changing languages wasn't too difficult to figure out. Then the game took a long long time to load with nothing but a blank screen and at first I thought it had crashed.\n\nOnce in the game it gives you no clear indication of how to reload the weapon. It was only once I got frustrated and flicked the gun upwards that I realised that method was in fact the way to reload. Things are pretty easy to figure out after that but the game just doesn't play very well.\n\nMany of the zombies are lying on the floor when you first encounter them and only awaken when you are standing right next to them. If you shoot them while they are lying down their death animation is triggered and they instantly stand up only to fall over. In addition, the zombie animation is pretty poor, but that is fairly standard for a lot of VR games.\n\nThe worst thing is probably the inaccuracy of the guns and this is a particular problem because the ammunition is fairly limited. I ran out of bullets trying to complete one of the cell block sequences and couldn't leave the area until all the zombies were dead. This migh not be such an issue in other games where you can resort to you melee weapon but in this game your bullets your only means of hurting the zombies. You can't punch them, push them away or hit them with your empty weapons. Without bullets you are completely defenceless and this makes absolutely no sense.\n\nThis game is far too early in its development cycle to have been released for sale. This sort of thing shouldn't even be allowed as early access. Get the game working properly first and then use the early access period to add features. This was a total disappointment and has become the first game on Steam that I have requested a refund for. It's a real shame as this feels like a wasted opportunity.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502621787, "timestamp_created": 1502621787, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197964916414", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 378, "last_played": 1502617672, "playtime_forever": 35}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
