My curiosity was sated in 3 missions.\n\nUltimiately I got annoyed too quickly. I only played the first three missions, but the mechanic of giving you a \"perk\" for a perfect score provided far too important and offered too much frustration.\n\nThe problem is 90% of the 3 maps I played were cake walks until the last few waves when I realized I messed up ever so slighty enough that a single zombie punched to my base would set me back another 10+ minutes trying again.\n\nSeeing the game is 20 or so maps, I don't see myself enjoying the escalation of difficultt that will likely be determined by how fast I can Micro-mange limited units hopping from base, to turret, to turret. \n\nGame feels like a realy nice RTS for people who like frantic RTS defense.
