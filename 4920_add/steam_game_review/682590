Dungeon Marathon is essentially a running game where you dodge enemies and collect apples to keep yourself alive. On normal difficulty apples are poisonous so you have to collect enough gold to buy detox potion. My main problem is just the lack of any motivation to play it. The game itself is very easy so the only challenge comes from not being familiar with locations of the apples. So basically the core of the game is grinding stages until you get all apples that give you a gold bonus. Unfortunately, I don't think you would want to play this game for a very long time that takes to master each stage.\n\nThere are 4 characters that you can unlock that have different speed and health. Aside from animation it really makes little difference. You don't really get any benefit for doing stages faster (which is weird cuz it is a running game with a marathon in the title) Another thing that bothers me is the usage of older assets. Verdict Guilty and Death's Hangover had a unique feel to them where this game reuses some of the sound effects. Also, I really did not care for the soundtrack, it was very generic compared to previous games.\n\nYou can avoid poison system by playing on easy but then collecting anything looses its purpose. The normal difficulty at the time of this review does not seem very balanced for a new player. While I enjoyed the game maybe for 1 hour it quickly outstayed its welcome. Gameplay is alright but it fails to keep things fresh and interesting. Most of the obstacles are easily avoided on a first try. There are a bunch of power-ups but you don't even need them. You can also buy things from the store that marginally impact gameplay if at all. Stages do not really change enough to create any memorable moments.\n\nI understand that developer has limited resources being mostly one person team. Being a fan of Retro Army it is a little painful to make this review. That being said I think he bit more than he could chew with this one. It just feels like there is an emptiness to the game with a lot of loose ideas. Maybe it's better to make a smaller game but one that you can do properly. Death's hangover, one of the best breakout games I ever played. This game, it just feels dull after few hours.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n+ interesting concept (different kind of running game for that matter) \n+ decent animation\n+ tight controls\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n-lack of funny story that other games had\n-weak soundtrack\n-no motivating progression\n-no challenging difficulty, mostly grindy \n-reused assets\n-limited mobility options \n\n[h1] Final Thoughts 5/10 [/h1]\n\nWhile not a terrible game I just feel that there are better options for $5. If you collect Retro Army games I am sure you will be able to get it on sale eventually. Dungeon Marathon kind of gets boring because there is no real challenge other than just grinding levels for apples. There is nothing wrong with simple games when you get some sense of purpose which I did not get from this game.  I think \"Collecting\" format was just a wrong choice for core gameplay. If developer designed it around speedrunning it would have made more sense. Other Retro Army games at least motivated you with funny characters. I would not be surprised to see some good updates later but right now I am not feeling it.
