However, it's a blast to play.  Very good graphics, nice 360 virtual world environments.  Fun, satisfying gun play.  No problems with tracking.  Decent variety of robot enemies.  Both defensive and offensive upgrades.  Best of all, you can also choose to teleport for locomotion or, like me, just have fun sitting down.\n\nMy primary complaint is that you do need to grind for a little bit to get an upgrade.  It's not too bad, but you start off with a revolver where you have to press trigger to shoot.  Well, that doesn't sound bad at first, but when you are killing 100s of enemies, it can start to feel tiring.  At least, my trigger finger started to feel tired.  There's no reloads which, I think should be added as it seems odd to have unlimited ammo and also no reloads.  Hint: save all your money ($3000 I think) to get your automatic weapon.\n\nEven with Early Access, this game has a lot of polish.  I think with a few more updates to add environments, guns, enemies, this could be a must buy... but for now, I do strongly recommend at the sale price :D\n\nnote: played on Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers ... can't speak for Vive compatibility", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504306512, "timestamp_created": 1504286121, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1506295435, "playtime_forever": 61}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
