One of my favorite modes is the rodeo mode (currently holding he high score.) The game is not easy either which is good. It does not hold your hand and wants you discover the tactics and the different ways to succeed in each level . The challenge is a great way to change things up and you simply can't get enough of it! The levels were great too I never saw the same map and enemy's in the exact same place. I hope to see more added in the future and great job!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506814184, "timestamp_created": 1506814184, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 256, "steamid": "76561198101181934", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "last_played": 1507158435, "playtime_forever": 256}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
