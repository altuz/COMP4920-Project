While some improvements were made, there are still glaring issues. For example, trading the number 2 overall draft pick will get you, at best, a future 1st round pick. And the ratings for rookies are always too low. Mitch Trubisky, for example, was so low that he was cut the next year and no one picked him up. Which is totally insane!

I have been playing sports sims from about the 1985 years. One of my first was a game called Dugout Decisions made by a company called First Base Software. The company is no longer around. I have been a user of Front Page Sports Football & Baseball, Madden, Front Office Football, and my all time favorite OOTP Baseball.\n\nMy only football sim I had before my purchase of Football Mogul as of 5 years ago is Front Office Football. I do not have the latest version. I decided to see what Mogul would have compared to Front Office. And from my reading reviews Front Office is just a roster update and rule changes the NFL made anyway. So I gave Mogul a shot and this what I have so far experienced.\n\nThe good is it can be totally customized to your liking in league set up, you can edit player ratings, make and add players and plenty of options. The game is fast as you can play 5 or 6 years in a 7 to 10 hour time frame. You can create and edit a playbooks, set prices and ticket values.\n\nNow the bad. If you are like me and want to be the coach and call plays, you can however I see no substituting players, no fatigue stat, but you can call a timeout??. Now I maybe missing something and if so let me know. You have no real sound it is just beeps and clicks. So you will not be able to listen to Nelly's (I am number one) unless you put in a DVD. Graphics are 50/50 as I don't expect a lot with a text base sim but, they look old even for this type of game. The drafting and game play/off Season is a bit wacky. Now this is on vanilla settings but, you have to trade away draft picks to make money to pay signing bonuses, yet I'm 55 million under the cap. I did fix this by going into commissioner mode and gave each team 250 mill in cash. Rosters are set at 100 players, no restricted free agency or franchise tags. \n\nAnyway I will keep the game as I have already gone past my 2 hours of play time on Steam. Would I get a refund if I could? Yes. I payed 27 with tax and I think this should be more around the 10 to 12 dollar range. I will play more and see if they update this with some patches. If so I will re-review.\n\nOver and out.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506098411, "timestamp_created": 1506098411, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 619, "steamid": "76561198011243257", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 71, "last_played": 1506107796, "playtime_forever": 619}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35071514", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462039", "review": "THE best Football manager game there is.
