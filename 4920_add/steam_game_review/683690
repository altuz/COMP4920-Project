It's very basic at the moment. It is alot like market tycoon but unlike market tycoon you are able to expand the market. I have not seen any gamebreaking bugs or crashes have any kind. \nThe layout is very good. If you like playing tycoon games then this is for you I highly recommend that you buy It because you will love It.

This basically a hobbyproject that anyone with a passing knowledge in programming can slap together in less than a day.\n\nHere is a list of things that I noticed in my less than 10 minutes of \"playing\":\n*It \"only\" runs at 150FPS on my rig, which usually does 200FPS for BF1 or similar titles on high graphical settings\n*Very high volume on launch\n*No options in-game, so you can't even turn the damn \"music\" off.\n*Repetetive soundtrack that assaults your ears constantly\n*Not even a \"Quit\"-button in the menu\n*Boring, bland, and downright terrible graphics, wouldn't be a problem if the gameplay worked, but..\n*Gameplay barely work because of shoddy programming and just bad design\n*The AI is dumber than anything I've ever come across, [strike]it keeps flooding your store even though you have nothing to sell[/strike] (dev patched as of 31/8, AI is still stupid though, and it keeps walking into itself and clogging up the whole store)\n*There is for some godforsaken reason latency between buttonpresses in this single player only title, HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?!\n\nThe \"developer\" seems extremely incompetent for unleashing this on Steam in such a state so I wouldn't hold my breath for these problems to get fixed either.
