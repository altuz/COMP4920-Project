There are 7 bosses with different stage events that require a unique strategy. For combat, you only have a dash, rifle attack, and a super attack. Controls are simple but they require hitting a timing window to deal any damage. If you have competent reflexes it should take about 5 hours on the lowest difficulty. My death count ranged from 3 to 48 deaths per boss. Some of them are more fair than other but overall it takes a lot of skill. It is easy to dislike CrownFall do to unrefined feel but I enjoyed the challenge once I understood how to fight.\n\n[b] Technical Notes: [/b]\n\nControls are a little weird and you can't change them. Game settings only have volume bars. Gamepad works but I find it extremely hard to use just because the game does not give you much time to aim with analog. You are welcome to try but I am using the mouse for this one. Also if you have gamepad in a port it will probably hide the mouse cursor.\n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b]\n\nCombat is not complex but the game focuses on reflexes so much that it becomes ridiculously hard. When using the rifle you have to hit a timing window that deals more damage and generates power for a super attack. Aiming locks you in place which puts you into a danger territory entire fight. Even though you only have 3 moves the bosses are so different that it does not feel repetitive. However, there are no RPG elements or any sort of power progression. It is pretty self-explanatory but figuring out the timing is where the skill comes in.\n\n[b] Aesthetic: [/b]\n\nIt is not a terrible looking game for $3. Quality tends to go up and down depending on which boss you fighting. I got to say that Lava Shark boss might take the cake for my favorite boss in any video game ever (**** hilarious, one of those things you should see before you die). There are a decent amount of unique animations on bosses like the Golem who keeps losing his limbs and changes how he attacks. Overall not too bad, I expected less, to be honest.\n\nThe music was great though. If it was made specifically for the game props to the composer.\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts 6.5/10 [/h1]\n\nIt is not a great game but the price of $3 is very fair for the experience. This is actually the first time I ever played a Boss focused game which is a fresh concept (from what I hear Fury is a much better example of that) All of the fights feel different and I think it is the best part of the game. Skill requirement is very high so some might enjoy the challenge.If you looking for a polished game with a good difficulty progression you should skip this one. But that LavaShark boss, you do not know what you missing.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504644245, "timestamp_created": 1503036574, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "last_played": 1504628363, "playtime_forever": 379}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34387084", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Where do I start.  I agree with other reviews saying it is a challenging game, mostly to the point where i was starting to get frustrated.  But to be honest, once I started to learn how to do the most damage, figure out what i can / can't do, it started to become a game that I am enjoying.  I think the price is exceptional for what you get to play.  Some of the bosses I did have to grind to figure out their rotation.  Be aware that the \"levels\" are you just fighting a boss, and if your stuck / having trouble on one boss, you can always go to another \"level\" and come back later.  So yes, I am enjoying the game so far ( just get past the \"learning how to do things\" and you will enjoy it to).  Last note - skip the first boss, come back to him later.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSGWl4et7XI", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503289319, "timestamp_created": 1503285499, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198121602186", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 56, "last_played": 1504296953, "playtime_forever": 218}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34348357", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488327", "review": "Dude!
