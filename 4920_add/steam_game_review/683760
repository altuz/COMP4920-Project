Neither DPS or hp is good enough.\n\nShe got two special skills.\n\nFlare causes blind, but monsters still hit me every turn.\nSteal has extremely low success rate. It might be easier just kill the monsters.\n\nSo yeah, thief is useless. that's why she is \"advance mode.\"\n\nIn the end, had some fun time, but I don't think I enjoy all the way.\n\nStoryline differs so little I almost believe both mage and thief are extra add-ons.\n\nGameplay is too \"OK\" so it's hard to recommend it.\n\nAll I could say is...it is only 2$.\n\n\n*original review*\nThis game is SHORT, like only 2 hours include grinding, for the warrior(blonde hair girl).\n\nAll the characters you pick are fundamentally the same: a tank pairs a mage.\n\nThe warrior has most hp.\n\nThe mage has lots of spells.\n\nThe thief has steal, which is likely to let you spend less time on looting (could be useful for mimics but I haven't try yet).\n\nStory is a little different, but It didn't change gameplay majorly.\nSo it quickly bored me out in the second playthrough.\n\n\nIn short, this game is just....\"OK\".\n\nSince it's cheap, I think I let it pass and grab all achievement someday.\n\nBut I think I'll rather suggest buying Helen's Mysterious Castle.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506264739, "timestamp_created": 1506234005, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 352, "steamid": "76561198069559674", "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 26, "last_played": 1506263206, "playtime_forever": 352}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35098097", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505197", "review": "This is a very average RPG Maker game that is rather short. Basically it consist of killing a bunch of monsters and 3 bosses in a 5 level dungeon (Castle).\n\nTo get all the achievements, you have to play the game 3 times with your main character as a Warrior, Mage and Rogue. However all 3 times are extremely similar because you are given a 2 member team (main character and secondary character), which basically consist of a TANK and a CASTER for all 3 playthrough. There is really not enough differences.\n\nThis game is kind of at the borderline between recommend and not recommend. It's a hard decision for me. However, since steam only allow 2 choices, I would go with recommend due to its low price. It's just a relaxing way to spend a boring evening with $1.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505971870, "timestamp_created": 1505971870, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198011891156", "num_reviews": 50, "num_games_owned": 758, "last_played": 1505971250, "playtime_forever": 465}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
