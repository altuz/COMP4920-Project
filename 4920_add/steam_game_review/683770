I have had a lot of fun building unnecessarily complicated rovers. Despite having only a handful of parts (or maybe because of it), Rover Builder is a deceptively challenging game.\n\nHowever, there are a few bugs/issues that I have found rather detracting. Fixing these will greatly improve the game.\n- Bearings don't always load correctly when the simulation starts. Sometimes they disappear and sometimes steel beams coming off of the bearings are in the wrong orientation. In order to fix this, I have to go back to the builder, delete the bearings, and reinsert them. Sometimes even that doesn't work.\n- Steering boxes can also disappear when the simulation starts. When this happens, they can't be replaced in the exact same spot in the builder.\n- The simulation is noticably slower when you have larger rovers or multiple rovers at once.\n\nI also have a few suggestions that I think would make this game a bit better.\n- Increase the stiffness on steel beams and joints. It would make it easier to build steering and suspension systems.\n- Make the stiffness of springs and pistons adjustable.\n- Increase the stiffness of the steering box.\n\nOverall, a very fun game. It has some bugs and quirks, but I am optimistic they will be fixed soon.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505626429, "timestamp_created": 1505626429, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 706, "steamid": "76561198079471657", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 89, "last_played": 1506854222, "playtime_forever": 1736}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35009558", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503517", "review": "This game is bringing what Scrap Mechanic is not capable to deliver after 1 or 2 years of unstable development.

Overall, good job developers that you created a heavy-duty competition to Scrap Mechanic as that game is pissing off everyone.

I cant recommend it in its current state, but il update if that changes. \n\nIts missing a lot of features like copy paste, the save system really needs to be miles better ( adding auto saving, renaming etc ) the physics could use  a bit of work (the kraken from ksp attacks a lot), there arent many parts or levels, it really, badly, needs hotkeys for building, most building is locked to 90 or 45 degree turns and one of the most annoying things in the editor is that theres no direct method to go forwards or backwards from your viewpoint (Only perpendicular to your point of view).\n\nThat being said, you probably got attracted here because like me you love  physics sandbox games, and there arent many. This one seems like it has a fun premise, the underlying building system seems like when finished it will be fairly intuitive and I doubt itll end up simplifying things too much on completion unless it gets simpler than it is now, so id say it has a lot of potential.\n\nI would hold off until some of the key deficiencies are dealt with however... if theyre dealt with. This is an ea game after all, so no guarantees.\n\n(Sept - 14)\n\n\nUpdate 01- Very soon after I made this review the dev seems to have fixed quite a lot of issues I had with the game. Things like the lack of hotkeys, keys for camera movement are greatly improved. Things like auto saving designs are still weird, key rebinds dont yet exist, and the save system could really do with perhaps folders or at the very least naming your machines, but the developer seems to be moving quickly to make the game far more playable and I dont doubt Il end up recommending the game.\n\n(Sept - 28)", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506634023, "timestamp_created": 1505418512, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 357, "steamid": "76561198180382099", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 133, "last_played": 1506649033, "playtime_forever": 1885}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35012871", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487745", "review": "Too buggy at this stage.
