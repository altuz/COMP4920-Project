Why?\n\nIt doesn't feels like a Commandos game. It's most dedicated to the action: there is a lot of explosions, demolitions, huge groups of enemies, a lot of big and powerful weapons available on the stages to be used, and the explicit objective of kill all the enemies on some missions. Yes, you can choose different ways to play, but there isn't reasons, contexts or awards to play it stealthily. The D-Day mission is the best example of this, with a big battalion at your orders like a RTS, random deaths on the beach like Saving Private Ryan and big cannons shooting. Contrary to this, the Marine's mission is the only greatly enjoyable stealth stage. The trains mission, one of the best of the game, doesn't works on Windows 10.\n\nIn addition, the control is a little bad and unconfortable, the texts and story worst and it has no sense (Why the nazis could explode the bridge of the train with their own troops? Why were the Commandos captured just under the Reichstag on Berlin? Why was the Green Beret, a high valued soldier on the first line of troops on the D-Day?), and there is a lot of funny glitches and unfunctional objects on the maps. The 3D is bad, doesn't works.\n\nBut... is still a enjoyable game only for true, true fans of the series. Some action missions are very well designed, the graphics are the best of the series, the music is excelent. But is a little repetitive. the code is careless, like an unfinished game.\n\nPD: I'll wait Commandos: Strike Force on Steam."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502977663, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505665", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34307581", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198208713288", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1502978728, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 781}, "timestamp_updated": 1502977663, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Game is good, but incomplete, missing graphics on one mission and Steam support says 'no refund, not our problem!'.
