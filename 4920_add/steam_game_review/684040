I really like this fresh and new take on the strategy game format. \nThe game is very complex, and highly addictive. \nYou play as a godlike entity (the \"main logos\") of the Earth, and your goal is to help mankind thru history. \nThere's a good spiritual message in the game, that you should care about one another, \ntake care of the environment, look things in another perspective, and make hard, sometimes questionable decisions for the greater good. It's not easy, you need to pay attention to a lot of variables (population, echology, etc.) otherwise you will fail very quickly. \nIf you like a game, that is challenging, thought-provoking and puts you on the edge through, \nthan I highly reccomend it to you. \nI would love to see more games like this. :)", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505820822, "timestamp_created": 1505820822, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "steamid": "76561198202633627", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 3, "last_played": 1507209875, "playtime_forever": 475}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34849733", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502736", "review": "I bought this game because the concept is interesting, but it's not worth 9.99. First of all, the graphics are mediocre, which I'm usually willing to look past for a small indie game like this, but the design is just downright unappealing in this game. Lots of clashing visual choices. As for gameplay, in addition to the outcomes being pretty boring, there is barely any explanation of how to play the game, or even what the objective is in a \"normal\" game, which forces you to play a campaign, but even thought they're described when you choose which mode you want to play, the objectives in the campaign are vaguely defined too. To make things worse, no matter what mode you decide to play on, you're stuck just kind of using your best guess at which cards will be the least harmful to your strategy. I could go on and on about the things wrong with this game, but I'll just end this by saying that don't recommend it for anyone looking for an engaging or rewarding gaming experience.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505003338, "timestamp_created": 1505002673, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047759014", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 48, "last_played": 1505000564, "playtime_forever": 169}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35110308", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499091", "review": "Instantly hooked, hoping for more updates and content :)  Need more planets  - to colonize and a chance to actually co-exist with aliens , but really good - surprised actually.\n", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506017004, "timestamp_created": 1506017004, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "steamid": "76561198035635524", "num_reviews": 41, "num_games_owned": 181, "last_played": 1506016938, "playtime_forever": 353}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
