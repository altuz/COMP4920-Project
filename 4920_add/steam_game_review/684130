However this game is truly terrible and not worth five dollars. I wouldnt have this in my library even if it was free. You are literally dropped into a random battlefield with nothing told to you; there are numbers at the top of the screen, what are they? No one was playing the game. No exaggerating, no one was playing the game. I must ask, why the hell did you release this game when it is so flawed? The game looks terrible, there is motion blur and sensitivity that you cannot change in the settings. Overall this game is flawed beyond fixing.", "votes_down": 15, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503013143, "timestamp_created": 1503013143, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198219490533", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 19, "last_played": 1503013137, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 170, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34374696", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610821", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1503268101, "review": "Judging by the screenshots, and the only promotional video's loath to show any combat in a combat-centric game, I already knew it was going to be bad. Then there was the only negative English review, both very telling signs.\n\nHonestly I bought this game full well knowing I was going to be refunding it, and wouldn't you know it, I did after only 6 minutes. But I won't even be going into detail with 'everything' that's wrong with this game, because there's a lot, so I'll just give you my reason.\n\nI might've given the game more of a chance if it weren't for A.) there being no NA servers whatsoever, and B.) After hosting my own server for 6 minutes and winning the game, I was forced into an endless loop of winning games immediately upon loading, even after restarting the game/server.\n\nSo after 6 minutes, the game became unplayable, literally.\nI mean... did you really even need someone to confirm to you that this over-priced glorified asset dump of a 'game' wasn't worth your time or money? Because it's not, just in case there was even a slight hint of a doubt in your mind that this 'game' had even the slightest merit.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": "15", "votes_funny": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503238916, "timestamp_created": 1503238916, "developer_response": "Sorry, We fixed this bug", "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198014353729", "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 372, "last_played": 1503238299, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 72, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34385252", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545336", "review": "Garbage!
