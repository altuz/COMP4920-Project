But I decided to give this game a try since it looked kinda fun and had a free demo for me to try out. So I gave the demo a go and found it was actually pretty alright once I understood how each module worked. It's all a matter of figuring out how to organize them to satisfy the objective. Demo hooked me so I bought the game and now I'm slowly making my way through each puzzle, some being harder than others and once in a while the game will introduce new modules. I kinda had to play with some of the modules to figure out how they worked, but once you get it you'll be good to go.  It's also nice how most of the time you have a choice between which puzzle you want to tackle first in case you want to take a break from one and try another. There may be some puzzles you'll have to sit through thinking out how to solve for a while (currently I'm stuck on this one normal puzzle that I can't figure out for the life of me for some reason), but once you finally figure it out it feels so satisfying and you actually learn through the process which will help you solve even harder puzzles. I'd recommend to anyone who likes to challenge themselves or if you just love puzzles in general. If you're unsure on if you'd like it or not, you should definitely give the demo a try!\n\nPros:\n- lots of fun and challenging puzzles\n- I'm sure anyone can pick this up and have a good time\n- progression of difficulty seems pretty good\n- have a choice for which puzzles to do\n- Puzzles save your work if you decide to exit out or work on a different puzzle\n- soundtrack is pretty good and adds to the game\n- Simple story but adds some context to the puzzles\n\nNeutrals:\n- could add more hints? that's just my personal preference since sometimes I get stuck for hours on a puzzle and just need a little push in the right direction, but its not nessesary. \n\nCons:\n- Sometimes the game introduces to you a new module and you don't fully understand how it works until you play around with it\n- maybe lacks in replayability?

I also love the mystery of trying out new parts of the system as they are introduced, some defined, some not -- and those that are not, are left for you to discover.\n\nThe style of puzzles and testing system is quite similar to Zach's game, and those familiar with the \"cram it in the least cycles and least parts as possible challange\" will feel right at home here.
