We will aded control remapping in a future release http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133984995\n\n-About the game not telling you where to go: the woman in the begining tells you to follow her, and then another NPC tells you about a certain base (although it's very obscure), and, right now, the game is fairly linear so it's hard to get lost. Besides, in the description we mention \"platformer metroidvania\" so future releases will feature a more \"open\" world. However, due to our \"platformer metroidvania\" goal, we won't be using modern-game conventions like compasses, on-screen prompts or \"go here\" arrows, because those things discourage exploration.\n\n-About not knowing the plot: this is where my first question comes in. How much story do you think an early access title should release on every update? I ask because I am not sure what is the best way to deliver the story as we go along, since it's not \"episodic\" and sometimes story may be interrupted because you reach the end of a build.\n\n-And my second question (related to the story part): how far did you get in the demo? I ask because the steam thingy says you played 0.2 hours, which is roughly 12 minutes, and I am not sure how far you got and how much of the vague story you managed to see or get from the NPCs.", "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198163515869", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 91, "last_played": 1505239169, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
