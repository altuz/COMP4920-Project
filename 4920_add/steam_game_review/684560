Even when you die, however, you simply respawn back at the terminal and restart the current wave. There is no exploration, one enemy type and the simple means of buying newer items. All of this would be okay if there was a sensible failure state or if there was an evident victory state outside continually fighting waves until you get bored with it.\n\nThe player starts off next to a terminal in a small square outside the city of Avalon V and must kill off waves of zombies in increased number to build up CR (in-game currency) to purchase better weapons and housing pieces. From time to time, a NPC will spawn and run to the terminal for extraction once the wave is complete. You can also build up fortifications such as turrets and barricades to make it easier to handle the waves, but that eliminates any player interactions outside the commencement of a new wave. This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if there was something else the player could do, but it boils down to waiting for zombies to get to you and killing them. There is no wave number indication, no sign of a ending and I cannot even get the game to rotate a simple wall when trying to build a house. \n\nYou can build fortifications if you wish too, but the difficulty makes it pointless. Zombies die with one melee swing and the cleave/range of the swing prevents them from hitting you. Housing also proves more a cosmetic approach. Who cares if you have a TV in your place when you can spend that currency on buying ammunition? AI is also something I noticed being a bit, wonky. When a zombie spawns, they stumble their way toward the player regardless of their location. This is alright, because even with the issue I noticed this still happens. There is a random occurrence, however, where all the zombies decide to run around the spawn points to the far right of the map when your back is to the terminal, pool themselves there, then perform a massive conga line toward you. This makes rounds last twice as long as they should and I was able to complete this past paragraph waiting for my turrets to kill off the conga line that formed.\n\nWhen I find myself easily completing a wave of 50 or so zombies by holding the mouse button and swinging away with my machete with my back to the wall, there is a serious problem lingering. The lack of difficulty ramping makes the game way to easy and the entertainment value diminishes as a result. At this point though, the game is barely worth a buck and left me bored within the first twenty minutes. This is the closest I felt to refunding a game and on this fact alone I cannot recommend it. Maybe it will get better down the line, but it is going to need some serious gameplay changes to claw its\u2019 way out of this verdict. \n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.\n\nTL; DR - Bland gameplay, too much downtime", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502222939, "timestamp_created": 1502222691, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000561257", "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 2901, "last_played": 1502219293, "playtime_forever": 95}, "votes_up": 19, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34109315", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498946", "review": "It's a decent game but no directions as to how to play and the game needs a LOT of work!
