In terms of user experience, the game is very bland, and it contains no more than the very basics for a FPS shooter. The game is quite stable though, as it hasn't crashed, glitched, or bugged out at any point while I was playing. Regardless of that, I would avoid purchasing this game, as it offers NOTHING new or exciting at all. It's a very generic game. \n\nOn top of that, it is also obvious to see that the game is using pre-built assets, such as the town map, which is literally a a drag and drop \"Pro Wild West\" map that you can buy on the Unity Asset Store. I am not completely sure about the guns, and I don't want to make any assumptions, but I feel like the fps multiplayer system, as well as the gun and player models, are also not crafted by the dev. This is kind of obvious by the extreme contrast between these and the cartoony map. If I were the dev, I would try to model my own map, and see how much fun it can be to see people play on something that you actually made yourself.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502376387, "timestamp_created": 1502376387, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198331396326", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 6, "last_played": 1502738435, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34161832", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512575", "review": "this game is dead", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502430622, "timestamp_created": 1502430622, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198280375194", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 31, "last_played": 1502464973, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34154066", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508965", "review": "This game literally consists of a couple of asset packs thrown together into a fps shooter.

There are some issues with it but I think if the dev updates the game and conitnues to work on it it could be a really nice one. The \"create a room\" idea of the game sound great but today I was only able to play a few team deathmatch rounds.
