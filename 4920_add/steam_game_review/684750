Steam looks bad for hosting this garbage for money, Hunters look like tools for 100%ing the game, visual novels look bad with this in their genre, the developer looks like a scammer and I look like a total twat for paying even less than 1$ CDN for this.\n\nThe game has a ton of achievements which actually have the potential to lock up the game on some resolution settings because they are generic unlock for clicking nothing crap with placeholder names.\n\nThe story is trash for a stand alone release and does not work for a few people I know.  (Hangs on one of the transitions and fails to go any further.) To be fair it might be alright if it was a single story in a series of short stories sold at 5$ or something but this is just abuse of the current sales system on steam. \n\nI am a huge fan of visual novels because often in the video game world they will touch on subjects mainstream games won't dare to go near. I am even alright with the smutty fan service visual novels because I know a lot of people who just like them even if they are not my thing.  However, this is just bad.\n\nSteam do yourself a favor and review / remove this game from your library and for the love of all things in this universe.  Put your foot down and do something about your achievement system.\n\nThis is a failure on many levels and the developer should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nMake up your own mind.\nDanielJMWaters.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505150333, "timestamp_created": 1505150333, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198064552920", "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 3668, "last_played": 1505150564, "playtime_forever": 393}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
