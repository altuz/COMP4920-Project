There are a lot of similar roller games around, this one, however, perhaps the most beautiful one. It seems to be utilizing everything Unreal Engine can offer, or even more - squeezing UE to the last drop. \n\nHowever, you need to have some great pc to enjoy all of its beauty, as on one hand UE does not seem to be the least demanding engine and on the other hand, game itself does not feel to be greatly optimized: it refuses to save settings, seem not to offer texture or detail settings (though, maybe they will appear later?)\n\nAnyway, as it does not cost a fortune, i recommend you to try it for its visual beauty and non-linear gameplay where whenever you fall you still find \"anomalities\" and\\or \"wormholes\". Tip: jumping high helps to see what way to move.", "votes_down": 14, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502634119, "timestamp_created": 1502634037, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110829497", "num_reviews": 240, "num_games_owned": 2596, "last_played": 1502633643, "playtime_forever": 47}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
