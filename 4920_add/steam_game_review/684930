Talking about the camera and mini-map. I like how the graphics look and how the game is designed, but the minimap mechanics are not my style at all and its rather a bother to have it this way. I know that not every game has to be the same but honestly the minimap of games like AOE or such alike is just very good and should be made alike those.\n\n((Besides that the game looks enjoyable but its not a game i would play with my mates on a LAN-Party at this state. I really would like to see more of this game because it really got potential and i hope its getting a \"improved\" WC3 or such, if thats fair to say :'D))\n\n- For the multiplayer-mode you can choose either Humans or Orcs sofar, no matter which you choose you will get to a window where you then can choose either \"Search lobby\" to randomly connect to the people who search for a game, and you can create or join a lobby (the lobby name gotta have atleast 5 characters in the name).\n\n((Now the problem is, when clicking on search lobby, it says lobby created and searching for players... But the match just never starts - i guess there are just no people searching for games sofar, so the game never starts))\n\n-> I give this game a thumbs-up for the idea of it, <-\nbut at the same time a thumbs-down due to the very very early state it is in rightnow", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506636939, "timestamp_created": 1502620497, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197994775969", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 322, "last_played": 1503322756, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34207376", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495106", "review": "just doesnt work", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502605589, "timestamp_created": 1502605589, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198068839865", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 86, "last_played": 1502434096, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
