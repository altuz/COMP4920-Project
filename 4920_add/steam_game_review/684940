The tutorial is useless, there are several parts to the tutorial and it seems to skip from one part to another at random before you get a chance to complete that part. In the end I gave up on the tutorial and tried to figure it out for myself. I wanted to play a particular town but It seems you have to complete the towns in the order it tells you to because only the Isle of Man is available. I tried to fill a truck with supplies and all of a sudden there's a big red exclamation mark over the truck and it appears to be in an endless loop. The game tells you to cancel this but doesn't tell you how to do it. At this point I gave up with it. Looks good but very frustrating UI.
