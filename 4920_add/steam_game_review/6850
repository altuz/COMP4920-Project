Would they ever remake some levels, I hope they start with some of these. The tech wasnt available but you can tell what the devs had envisioned. With HITMAN I suppose this vision finally came true. \n\nTowards the end of Hitman 2 you can tell that they ran out of time, money, or patience. Levels become less detailed, bugs more prevalent, missions less fleshed out, and they even re-run the same area. From the containers / cabinet placement you can tell they planned on adding the 'hide/dump in container' feature, but never got to implement it. The fact that you cant carry your sniper in a suitcase really sucks, but it also makes for a challenge. \n\nFor some reason, cool items like a pager and a phone only appear once. Some items dont even work if you use a cheatcode to spawn them (like the pager and the phone), and sadly you cant spawn just one item, you have to spawn all the items available on you, finding yourself digging through Chocolate, Key, Poison, Pizza, just to find the damn Smoke Bomb or something. \n\nI like the fact that you pick weapons to take with you on a series of missions in a particular country, and how the weapons you gain or lose are (not) present in the next mission, and that you get to see the map before the mission starts. Having a home is also a nice touch. In this Hitman, 47 as a character, contrary to the other titles, has a lot more humor, empathy and cultural interest. It doesnt look bad on him. I thought that was fun to see. Its also worth noting how the voice overs have improved so much since Hitman 2. They went from crackheads on a mic to Samuel L Jackon.\n\nIf youve played the later Hitman games first but you want moar Hitman, Hitman 2 can still scratch that itch for you.\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500289182, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493027", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "33605454", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198400456567", "num_reviews": 60, "last_played": 1500372280, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1389}, "timestamp_updated": 1500289182, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good"}]}
