I had a bit of fun cause I'm a zombie/gore fan, but there is absolutely no substance to be found here. Your player character also repeats the same 3-4 lines over and over that are filled with profanity. Normally vulgar language does not bother me at all, but this takes it to an extreme. The game does look decent and runs on the unity engine, and mechanically, works as it should. I got this game for less than an american dollar, and sadly can't reccomend it for even that price.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504770628, "timestamp_created": 1504770628, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197961098988", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 285, "last_played": 1504770496, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35330686", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "review": "This is straight out horrible:\n- the models and sound are annoying\n- the missions to unlock new equipment seem to all be just \"kill x enemy\" quests\n- enemies just run straight towards you, doesn't seem to contain any actual AI\n- no multiplayer, NPC's or gamemodes\n\nWith a high coupon, you can get one easy achievement here.
