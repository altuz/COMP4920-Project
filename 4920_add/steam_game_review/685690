The graphics are cartoony but good, especially the guns.  I've only played the first stage and so far i've experienced using 3 different kind of weapons and they were all awesome.  The narrative is halarious as you play (it's an old man telling his stories to a child).  There is no locomotion in this game, it's a wave based shooter.  It doesn't bother me at all because it keeps the environments fresh and the variety of enemies coming at you constant.  You can block enemy bullets with your gun OR shoot their bullets as well!  It's a polished game that i believe is worth the money.\n\nCon:  I found a glitch where the stage 1 boss gets stuck.  I had his health all the way down and I think he needed to go to a certain spot for the death animation to happen.  You can see it in the gameplay video if you'd like.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503962726, "timestamp_created": 1503962726, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198053682704", "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 61, "last_played": 1503954459, "playtime_forever": 37}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
