This game isn't some new indie darling. It isn't the new Binding of Isaac or Minecraft. It's just an endless runner that's been stripped to its bare. \n\nThe soundtrack which just loops is actually very well made. The loop kept me engaged and was very well composed. It's definitely on the level Jetpack Joyride with its tunes. That's no joke. I'd actually be glad to have the song in my music collection.\n\nThe game looks boring because there's not a single endless runner that is actually interesting to watch. They're for the player. The simplicity allowed me to wander into my thoughts and give me a chance to recover from all of the other games I've been playing. Games like Mount & Blade, where every wrong decision could screw up hours of progress and Ziggurat where the meta is supposed to be followed and being perfect on harder difficulties is a must. \nIn this, I just played, thought about what I've done recently and just recollected myself.\n\nThe graphics are simplistic. The UI is robust and the animations are actually very smooth for something this small and cheap. \n\n\n\nSo, overall, sure, this isn't worth the 1\u20ac, but that's because I'm a cheap bastard. The maximum I would've paid and been happy about spending would be 0,50\u20ac. \nIt's not perfect, but it isn't aiming to be.
