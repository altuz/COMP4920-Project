There's no Steam Achievements, But if you can pass this game, Rest assured, That's an achievement on its own.\n\nI recorded a little gameplay video so you can see pretty much what the game is all about, I only made it to part 2 of Chapter 1 before I ended the recording, This is because already the game was super tough and my frustration kicked in. Hopefully you have more patience and more skill to survive, I really like where this game is heading though!\n\nI was really confused though, I couldn't figure out how to use the dynamite, But I loved the exploding barrels and blowing up the house! (I should've played the tutorial).\n\nOne thing I didn't realize is, As it says in the description, If you get shot in the arm, You lose your weapon (Luckily you have the revolver AND the shotgun), I didn't notice this and was wondering why I couldn't shit, But that being said, You must be extra careful not to get shot at ALL!\n\nAll in all, I'm going to recommend this because it runs smooth, It actually means something to pass it (Means you're skilled and have patience) and I overall enjoyed playing it. Will definitely continue to play it!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z66RFUNvYOA", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506395236, "timestamp_created": 1506395236, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "steamid": "76561198003384433", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1013, "last_played": 1506398992, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35267763", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492683", "review": "This game is very Hotline Miami esc and I think that it is amazing.

I finished the first Chapter in about 8 to 9 min. So its short. Its like an 8 bit over the top Spaghetti wester. You start with a shot gun and a pistol and later can get Dynomite. it may be short but still fun.
