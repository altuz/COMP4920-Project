I think the general consensus is that Blood Money is the best of the series. It retains the typical Hitman formula while once again improving the mechanics and gameplay. In a phrase, it makes the gameplay more \"casual accessible,\" but what that really means is that the game mechanics are leaps and bounds better than Hitman 2. Agent 47 is able to move quicker while readying his garrote. He's less cumbersome and the game is more fluid because of it. \n\nThis game is what linked Hitman to the song Ave Maria, and it's link is great. It's a very memorable moment in the series. \nio Interactive, the developers of the Hitman series, did well with this franchise by improving on it title over title while still retaining its addictive and unique gameplay."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504885624, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505783", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 7, "recommendationid": "34817299", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158134330", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1504952840, "num_games_owned": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 671}, "timestamp_updated": 1504885624, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The best coin tossing simulator I've ever played in my life."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504850999, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500998", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34808801", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198165218108", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505387796, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3053}, "timestamp_updated": 1504851012, "received_for_free": false, "review": "one of the most classic games all the time,I played it dozens of times"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507046013, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35450412", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198349881541", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506977619, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_forever": 85}, "timestamp_updated": 1507046013, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great entertainment!
