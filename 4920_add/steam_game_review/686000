The later levels can be quite challenging (which is exactly what you want from this type of game), and finding a solution that earns a massive score after several re-tries is always rewarding.\n\nThe story is intriguing -- most of the plot-driving events happen during the game's home stretch, but there's a healthy amount of development and foreshadowing before that. It even cleverly sets up a post-game, should you wish to continue going for higher and higher scores after the end.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504078877, "timestamp_created": 1504078877, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198061114474", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 86, "last_played": 1504315096, "playtime_forever": 392}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34513096", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "review": "I just bought this game.
