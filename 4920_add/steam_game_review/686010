When I first got the game I thought it was merely going to be a game involving a white stag running from a hunter that I had assumed wanted to kill him because it was a rare creature, I didn't know the game would be having Greek mythology (which made it feel like the game was less than what it could have been).\n\nI did die a lot, though a large portion of this was thanks to the running sequence in the Dragon's Cave. I'm not an advanced PC gamer and typically when I'm in a high-stressed situation I tend to tense my hands up. This causes issues for me because them I'm trying to direct my character while I end up mashing buttons together. Personally, I hated that one sequence the most because this game follows a lot of \"There are pathways you HAVE to follow or you need to start over\" situations. I'm fine with the ones where I can walk around at my lesure, but it's not easy to escape one of those by running and have to not be burned alive while following a pathway, but the whole screen is red (They seriously did not have to make the entire area red to hide your vision, that was just unessecary and caused me die on a lot of turns)\n\nAside from that, the game was really interesting, it did scare me a bit in some situations and make me think on some of the puzzles. Though I feel like it could have done a bit more in the explaining bit of things, as I didn't understand some of the situations going on in the game (Like why we needed a basilisc's special bell to wake up a dragon. It also doesn't make sense why someone would put enchanted bells on a creature that won't wake up unless otherwise and turns you into stone anyway. It's counterproductive in so many ways).\n\nThe biggest interesting point of this game was that you got to play through the game as an animal, which is somewhat rare in these type of games, as you typically go about playing a human. Though I will say that you're a White Stag, a creature that's basically the pride of a Greek Goddess and yet you're in her forest, and everything wants to kill you. \n\n3/5 in my book, it could have had more special and unique of a game if it didn't tie itself with Greek Mythology. Honestly I thought that as a White Stag, I'd be hunted by this man who has some personal vendetta against me. I thought I'd end up learning that a sickness had swept a village and this white stag comes in at the same time of the sickness. Many speculate that the animal is the cause of the illness, but to the village, white colored animals are considered sacred and those who kill the animal are said to be cursed, as are the ones who they consider close or best friends. Though a man who lost everything to the sickness attacks out of rage after lossing his family, basically having nothing left to lose.\n\nIf the game went like that, it could have been a lot more emotional, as you'd understand the hunter's rage and get a sort of more driven story and also actually feel hunted down. With this, you manly feel like you're blindlessly walking, trying to get out of a murderous forest without really having a clue of what you are doing. I only reccommend this because it did have its moments.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506203823, "timestamp_created": 1506203823, "developer_response": "First off, I'd like to thank you for your very honest and very well-mannered review of my game. It is very important to me that I am able to receive feedback that isn't sugar-coated but at the same time doesn't solely exist to bash the game.\n\nIn response to your complaint about the Dragon\u2019s Den, I\u2019m sorry but I won\u2019t be changing that part of the game since other players have expressed that it was the easiest part of the game for them and were able to run through unscathed in one go. There are warning noises that let you know if you\u2019re getting too close to a \u201cburning spot\u201d and there is enough time allotted to allow you to slow down at the turns. It appears to me the \u2018difficulty\u2019 of a lot of areas hinges on the player which, for me, is satisfying because it creates a happy medium. I\u2019d rather things be tricky for some and easy for others rather than too easy or too impossible for everyone as the original game had been. That being said, I won\u2019t deny that there have been aspects of the game that need and will receive updates [several updates have already been made as you may have noticed and at this point it\u2019s only the final area that needs further updates].\n\n[As for the Basilisk Bell logic\u2026.you already guessed this game draws heavily from Greek mythology, if anything I made an effort to add MORE logic to their nonsense ;) ]\n\nYour assumption that the hunter wants to kill the stag because it is rare is still correct and he does have very personal reason to pursue it. As to why the forest poses so much danger to the stag well\u2026 it\u2019s obvious from your commentary that you haven\u2019t seen the true ending which would provide an answer to that as well as many other questions.\n\nI would like to note that this game was made with the intention of being replayed. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get all the answers the first time round, in fact I\u2019m counting on it. In the first run you\u2019re more interested in leaving the forest than finding out what\u2019s going on and if you go through the game with that attitude, you\u2019ll get what you want. I personally cannot stand games that spoon-feed everything to the player. I\u2019ve always liked games where you\u2019ve had to think and explore; games that can be frustrating but because of that be all the more rewarding when you get the answer. Think Zelda, Dragon\u2019s Lair, Kingdom Hearts or doing a nuzlocke run with Pokemon [Don\u2019t misunderstand, I am NOT insinuating this game is on the same level]. If that\u2019s not your cup of tea, I completely understand.\n\nFinally I HAVE to ask, is the concept of playing as an animal THAT unique? Everyone keeps telling me that\u2019s the most intriguing part of this game. WHY?! Is there really NO other of this type of game that\u2019s done that?\n", "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 295, "steamid": "76561198068982009", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 13, "last_played": 1506201754, "playtime_forever": 295}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
