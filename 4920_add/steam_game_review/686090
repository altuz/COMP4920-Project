Not nearly as shitty as most early access games on steam, and although the game definitely needs some polishing, there is still hours of content and it is by all means playable.\n\nIt isn't too buggy and has a lot of content for early access. Check the steam forum to join a server while the dev is fixing the server list. \n\nFrom the screenshots the game looks a lot more crappy than it really is. I was expecting to get this game just to try it and refund it but it's actually pretty good plus its only ten dollars.\n\nIt is still in alpha and definitely nothing like a fully released game but it is by all means playable and fun, and the dev is very active on the forums and he has a good sense of humor. \n\n\n\nBeware this is a difficult game, and the NPCs are really not pushovers. If you just start up and run at a monument to kill golems, you're going to get REKT. But if you learn the game and the elemental resistances and weaknesses you will find it much much easier to survive.\n\n\nIf you want to enjoy this game you should just start off by exploring while collecting random plants and rocks from the ground and then experimenting with the alchemy system and then start upgrading your gear which will make you much stronger.\n\n\n\nOverall I give it an 8/10 on the Steam early access scale. It's a pretty good investment for 10 dollars, Just get it and if you don't like it, you can refund it.\n\n\n\nAlso, try playing it with a friend or a random player you meet on the server, its a lot better co-op", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506379009, "timestamp_created": 1506365462, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 435, "steamid": "76561198101687602", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 20, "last_played": 1506478543, "playtime_forever": 435}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35204334", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492396", "review": "Dont buy this game Right now, Cool concept but just liek Mortal Online people Abuse game Mechanics making it not fun for others, as of now you cannot even get out of the starter city without getting cucked by Greifers and losing all your stuff, and unfortunatly just liek Mortal online the Devlopers and GM's support this kind of Behaviour there \"reputation\" system Detere's nothing. As of now the concept is cool what I saw of the town was cool and the grass in front of the town was cool. but I never even got to see any Mob's or wildlife or anything, so I refunded. And I suggest any players that want to and love to explore and discover games stay away from this one for now until the dev's and the GM's get there stuff together. I want to further explain and say that it is impossible to band together with other players when all the other players are shooting everyone as well. Picture trying to drive to your grandmas house but everytime you put a foot out the door a blade from Jesus space cuts your foot off everytime or cuts you to ribbons and you cant even go anywhere or do anything. If you liek this type of gameplay enjoy Bon apetite but if you have a brain and enjoy actually playing something Even Citadel is better then this.", "votes_down": 11, "language": "english", "comment_count": "18", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506351372, "timestamp_created": 1506351313, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "steamid": "76561198103893709", "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 234, "last_played": 1506349201, "playtime_forever": 16}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
