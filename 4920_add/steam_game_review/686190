The moral of the story seems to be, never hesitate to murder someone when a shady character gives you instruction to do so. Despite this strange set up I Found myself routing for Hatsuki and her awesome rocking tits. She seems like a nice girl despite being a lunatic and her ultimate goal once she has commited murderes enough is to finally get some D in the V in some of the most confusing and unessisary censorship I've ever seen. I've beated the the game now and yet there is never a chance to see our heroic killing machine's Ta Tas. For some reason who ever published the game thought it nessisay to Cover Hatsuki's presumeably awesome hooters with little flowers and her lady parts with a cartoon bunny, yet felt it was totally cool to show her being raped by beasts, slaying countless people and beings gang banged surrounded by spend condoms.

Completed the game twice in one day and got different missions and enemies depending on witch route I picked (losing or winning battles)\n\nI managed to get to 4 different endings (of 5) but you only need to complete the game once to unlock [i] allllll \t[/i] scenes, images and so on! So there is no need for multiple playthrough's! \n\nThe story is good (especially for the price) but the translation is horrible, and I mean horrible. The text often does not even fit within the screen!! (exept for the special scenes ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0), they are really well translated!) but the story and mission briefing can even at some points be difficult to understand!\n\nThe controlls however... Where do I even start..? THEY ARE ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE with close to 0 rebinding potentional! You have to walk with arrow keyes or numpad ( 8,4,6,2) and rebinding to \"w,a,s,d\" seems to not be even possible! And to accept you press enter, space or enter on numpad. And for backward or \"meny\" its esc (atleast this one is good) or 0 on numpad! \n\nAnd now back to the endings, !!SPOILER WARNING!!\n\n[spoiler]\nTried so hard to save boyfriend even when I was captured, but no matter what I did I could not get the good end, so if you want a \"good end\" you have to win every single fight and never lose, not even once! So save often if you are unsure of how well it is going. The bad ending has some good scenes, but the story is horrebly heart breaking and not recommended unless you are into that. (you sick frogggg (in lack of swearing words) ) \n\nBUT\nThe \"good end\" is not that good eather. You do save yourself for him and the scene when they finally get to it is kinda heartwarming! BUT, the day after you will run away with just a letter for him that tells him all you have done (all the killings you have done to the people that do deserve to die (in my book atleast) ) and he will be heart broken and you will be lonley and never meet him again. So cant say I liked that end, would have prefered if they got married, moved away, Maybe had a kid and a nice farm and lived happily ever after (because they both deserve it) but no, SHE JUST HAVE TO RUN AWAY TO \"ATONE\" FOR HER PRETTY MUCH NON EXICTENT SINS! GAAAAAAAAAAH. [/spoiler]\n\nLong story short, its a good game, gameplay is good, the special scenes are well made (but some are a bit sickening for me)!\n\n[spoiler] And if you sticked all this time, here have a cheat code! It will unlock all gallery items if you dont want to play thru the game to see everyting, but just buy the game to look at the ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) .\n\nHow you use it you will have to figure out yourself however! But a tip is that it is not in the game but a text document (or something like it) in the game save files or close to them atleast! \nThe code is:   [b] assassinhaz [/b] [/spoiler]\n\nThank you for reading and apologize for grammar and so on if I messed some up! ^^", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506125120, "timestamp_created": 1506113593, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 656, "steamid": "76561198047887445", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 297, "last_played": 1506080860, "playtime_forever": 656}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35368920", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497858", "review": "Why did i buy this", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506843745, "timestamp_created": 1506843745, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "steamid": "76561198065888722", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 38, "last_played": 1506444481, "playtime_forever": 183}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35140175", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496925", "review": "if you\u00b4re bored and you dont have somebody to play....this is your game because you can \u00b4\u00b4kill\u00b4\u00b4 some time wasting your life with this.\nits hard as nokia snake\neverything can \u00b4\u00b4kill\u00b4\u00b4 you\nlevels are full of monsters to farm lvl before the boss kill you with 1 punch\ni didnt finished the game at all because a bug close the game and i lost all chapters................im pretty lazy and tired to play all again.\nthe patch in one sentence............................................\nyour parents\u00b4ll burn and shoot you if they launch the game.........\n\ninfinite/finite", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506360679, "timestamp_created": 1506124307, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "steamid": "76561198261031472", "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 99, "last_played": 1506123672, "playtime_forever": 162}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35232823", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498768", "review": "the game is pretty fun and does have a very interesting story line which you can play for both sides you dont have to even enter the sexual side of the game from what i can tell (i could be wrong since ive only played 2 hours) however the plot is still pretty nice and different the game somewhat feels similar to material girl but it actually has a plot line which material girl doesnt really have (still a good game thought!) i like the style of the combat becasue your character actually moves and it isnt just a picture plus if your on the sexual side then you get to see monsters have sex with her while attacking them its very different but interesting on the down side i dont really like how the game is cencored it could have been done a bit better becasue its kind of odd looking at a bunny/ghost thing cover her privites but i think thats my only complant the english isnt as bad as people are making it out to be", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506472875, "timestamp_created": 1506472875, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 246, "steamid": "76561198212979851", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 67, "last_played": 1506827993, "playtime_forever": 246}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35101815", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481030", "review": "Heeeey I'm usually very open to things and forgiving, but I'm an English major and I couldn't take the broken English anymore.
