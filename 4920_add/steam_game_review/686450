Though a long-time fan of rolling ball games, it\u2019s another matter to have any degree of success with them. Of the dozens in this player\u2019s collection, none have yet been completed (for various reasons.). TLBTC shows every indication of being THE exception to this long-time rule.\n\nAt first look, TLBTC seems to be rather sterile, and overwhelmingly repetitive. However, gameplay indicates that there is vastly less truth to that than at first appearance. Each of five areas of 24 levels each simply requires a significant amount of real estate in order to fully utilize that zone\u2019s concepts and possibilities fully. And that is a huge plus, as you listen to very pleasant music.\n\nTLBTC is actually more than a single game. True, in order to unlock additional of the four locked worlds (after the original unlocked one) a certain number of tasks need to be accomplished, but the quantity is very accommodating to the vast number of players. Each of 120 levels (seemingly) has the same three tasks: finding a single puzzle piece, finding all three diamond shapes, and completing a speed-run in a generally quite generous time limit. Without conscious effort, this player unlocked the third world while still well within the second one. (The speed-run, generally to be attempted separately form the \"searches\", also has a highly motivating three-tier leaderboard.) Additionally, TLBTC has achievements with purpose, and not simply \u201cparticipation trophies\u201d, as is far too common. (Even numerous achievements for failure!)\n\nWhere TLBTC may seem repetitive is when players originally see the complexity of each level. It can be very daunting indeed, and more so to realize that of each level\u2019s (often) DOZENS of path possibilities, there may only be one optimal path for speed-run success (but likely more), and only one path for locating the needed items. (Thus, an achievement for starting any level ten times.) And to add to the challenge\u2026.no control over camera movement, and only a small section of the level available at any time, with the ball dead center. It\u2019s frequent to not see a spot where the ball must go, so the walls become partially transparent for that place (but won\u2019t show a drop-off. HINT: Hidden places very often contain needed objects.) Also fortunate, the player has control over save locations, within the parameters of the \u201csave buttons\u201d that may, or may not be rolled over as is frequently the player\u2019s choice.\n\nThe ball control within TLBTC is basically perfect, which is necessary considering the many dangers to be encountered. Balls can fall into the ocean, be crushed behind \u201cball pushers\u201d, be explosively \u201cspiked\u201d, or fall without landing on a cushion pad, breaking into shards. And all this may be overcome just to discover that the level is complete\u2026.but without finding the necessary objects. But no worries! Each traverse causes the pool of knowledge of that level to grow.\n\nPerhaps TLBTC isn\u2019t as inexpensive as comparable games, but are there comparable games?
