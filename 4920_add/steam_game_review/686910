I know how much time and effort has to be put in a game for it to be released at all, and when one person pulls it off, I take my hat off to him.\n\nNevertheless, the experience I had with this game was unpleasant.\n\nAs we all got to learn, a first person horror game isn't gonna roll without loads of text for the player to read. In 'Delirium' however, you will spend as much time reading books than exploring the setting. The texts are too long and purple-prosey to enjoy them on their own, and they are the only means by which this game tries to tell a story. The H. P. Lovecraft allusion don't help.\n\nThe house itself is a few rooms, but there is nothing to discover there. The rooms are boring. Some textures are okay, but the huge difference between them is what breaks the immerson -- one is very sharp and detailed, others are blurred. Some even seem to be faulty, with big black pixels all over them. The lighting is, as usual with the more amateurish typed of horror games, unrealistic. It bends around corners, drops off after two meters and so on. I know this game has been made with the Personal Edition of Unity, but when there are two or more lamps burning in a room, this room won't have pitch black corners. This is not even a design thing anymore.\n\nThe sound is horrible. The constant background whispering gets annoying real fast. I believe that sound design might be more effective in a horror game than graphics. But the sound design in Delirium is lazy. Your footsteps all sound the same regardless of whether you're walking on wood or on sand or on grass. The ticking clock can be heard all the way outside the house, whereas a fire won't make a noise.\n\nIt's not free of bugs either. One time I got stuck between the table and the couch. On the other hand, in the yard, you can walk right through trash cans since they have no collision detection. That's sloppy.\n\nI didn't care at all.\n\nNote to the creator: Please don't give up. I really respect your work, but there is so much stuff that needs to be done or seems unfinished, the game shoudn't have been released yet.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504224225, "timestamp_created": 1504224225, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960758441", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 359, "last_played": 1504222830, "playtime_forever": 40}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34725729", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485089", "review": "This game has only 1 jump scare and about consistent levels of the feeling of some kind of impending doom. However, the story is lacking in any kind of detail other than the journals found throughout the game. It is designed to creep you out for 10 minutes in hopes that you have nearly 0 I.Q. in order to not question the game at all. There is absolutely zero explanation as to why our character is even in this house or why we cant go anywhere other than the house. I found myself asking why I was in the house in the first place which was a good thing until there was no story arch to back it up. Maybe there is some hidden layer that someone needs to unlock, but I seriously doubt it. \nIf I find anything particular that changes my mind about this review, I will make sure to change it.\nI do recommend more people play this game in hopes there will be more to come, but 5$ just for that little bit. I get more out of free to play games that are crowd funded.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504490844, "timestamp_created": 1504490751, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198325992058", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 13, "last_played": 1504371391, "playtime_forever": 315}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
