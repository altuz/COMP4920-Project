Boy was I not disapointed.\n\nUnlike most VN's, this game isn't just all static and plain backgrounds with motionless sprites. Aside from also being a side scroller and point and click mystery \"who-done-it\", there is also some animation added at certain points that play out much like an animated tv show (anime, if you will) and during dialogues, the characters bodies move slightly and blink their eyes, giving a sense of immersion that you normally don't get from a stereotypical VN. It's the little details that count.\n\nBasically the story revolves around the main character, Detective Ayami Ito, who is investigating a hostage case from a few months earlier. Without giving too much away, [spoiler] you're partner and love interest gets caught in a similar stance and things go horribly wrong. Stripped of your rank and police resources, you then spend the remainder of the game \"investigating\" what happened, leading you down a rabbit hole into the darkest places of the Tokyo nightlife, from back ally crime syndicates to ancient myths to suicidal cults, you have to make decisions on how to approach the witnesses and get the info you need to move on. Whether you take your meds and emerge as an uncorruptable beacon of hope, or a paranoid, nerotic, self-hating mess is up to you. [/spoiler]\n\nThe game isn't terribly long, took me about 6 hours to complete one play through, but there are multiple paths to help keep it from being too redundant.

The game represents combination of story-driven visual novel style and choice-based element, setting in deep dark corners of Tokyo.\n\nYou play as detective Ayami Ito, searching for her missing partner, and uncover the truth of Tokyo urban legend. The story pacing is well done, intrigues player with clear goal, but tricks you with psychological elements. The dialogues are well-written and natural; some are related to philosophy and mythology as supporting elements.\n\nThe art style is totally optional; it is what I expect from Kickstarter. Each scene has own quality soundtrack that capture the feeling and atmosphere expect very few unpolished background. The game also includes few animated sequence from Graphinica (Production Company behind series such as Hellsing, Long Live!), which it might be reason of release price.\n\nIn term of gameplay, you progress the story by searching clues in area and asking various NPCs for information. Gathering information sometimes requires puzzle solving, but it is not particular hard and allows multiple approaches.\n\nIto\u2019s mental state represents in S.P.I.N features (Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, and Neurosis). Most of every decision does matter, it has own consequence that affect some of her S.P.I.N stats which can lead to her different perspective, choice, and endings. It reminds me old mechanics from various crime games and well implement into VN style.\n\nHowever, I feel like S.P.I.N system is easily manageable and doesn\u2019t emphasize player awareness due to less punishment. The game design introduces the importance of choice by disable save-load system on your first playthrough and enables broken memory features to let players experience different choices. It\u2019s quite smart design that supports repeatability although there are only six slots. The game also has startup issues and game-breaking bug on release which they are fixed in latest patch, but still remain some UI display issues.\n\nOverall, Tokyo Dark is quite short experience (4-6 hours for first playthrough), but fill with interesting gameplay, well-written psychological storyline, and strong dark atmosphere. If you interest in this kind of genre, Tokyo Dark is great choice to try.  \n\n\n---------------[\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22]---------------\n\nTokyo Dark

The storyline is essentially just a mash-up of various Japanese horror tropes like they were trying to check as many boxes as they could, and it all comes together to form a plot that basically never manages to surprise you. It's advertised as a mix of point-and-click adventure and visual novel, but in reality it's basically just a visual novel that also lets you walk around. There's a grand total of a single puzzle that amounts to clicking on flickering lights in order, and occasionally you get the choice of either skipping a 'puzzle' by shooting something or taking a few steps to the left to click on something else to solve it a different way.\n\nThe game presents itself as being similar to Telltale's choice-based adventure games, and you have a 4-way stat system for Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, and Neurosis, but neither of these matter much in practice. Most of the time the game is too scared to punish you for any of the minor choices, and in my two playthroughs so far the stats haven't made any visible difference at all. The game has 11 endings, but the replay feature barely works so it's hard to justify trying to get all of them - you only get the ability to manually save after your first playthrough, but you're limited to 6 save slots and can only save at predetermined points in the story, and some of these spots are poorly placed so that you have to scroll through several minutes of text to get back to them. There is a skip function, but it's just as broken, and half the time it won't let you skip text you've already read while other times it [i]will[/i] let you skip text you [i]haven't[/i] read before. I only got what seems to be the two \"main\" endings, but I really don't care enough to go back and look for the other 9.\n\nIt isn't an awful game, but I think it's at least overpriced at $18. It's fairly buggy and the features that do work seem half-finished at best, and chances are the story is nothing you haven't seen before. If it'd been priced at $10 I could maybe recommend it, but it's not worth almost 20.", "votes_down": 16, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505071077, "timestamp_created": 1505071077, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995820083", "num_reviews": 627, "num_games_owned": 1121, "last_played": 1505071084, "playtime_forever": 568}, "votes_up": 36, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34896212", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530793", "review": "Well, keep in mind I don't like horror and paranormal-related stuff and I've always been reluctant about point'n'click games. Tokyo Dark just appealed me out of nowhere, resulting me to give it a try even if I don't like the genre. But, it was so much more surprising that I would ever imagine.\n\nPros.\n\u25ba Graphism, artworks are pretty clean while some levels are really welldone. The promoted cutscence made by that one studio looks fine but no need to bet on in neither. UI is pretty clean too.\n\u25ba Audio, pretty great OST for an indie game and overall sound effects work great in installing the game's ambiance.\n\u25ba Storyline, I've really hooked the storyline. Despite all the psycological horror theme, I've really enjoyed every bit of it. From detective business, to police HQ moment, to help people out and everything after that. Well built stroy with a good amout of definitive choices and momentum changing choices. \n\u25ba Characters design, the main grills characters (It\u014d -you- and Reina), especially It\u014d-waifu, own a pretty unique and well-created design. However Tanaka (your partner) falls a bit into a perfect, caring and altruistic hasbundo clich\u00e9 \n\u25ba Deep ambiance, Tokyo Dark has no trouble to quickly create its own ambiance leading to insanity moments, crutial decision-making momentum and sometimes a more relaxed pace.\n\u25ba Optimisation, runs smoothly without any trouble.\n\u25ba SPIN system, nice touch to the game leading advanced character design.\n\u25ba Visual novel and point'n'click hybird, well it is an interesting hybrid to be honest, having the freedom of point'n'click and the story-telling of a visual novel.\n\u25ba Endings, this game own 11 different endings resulting of your choices plus 6 secondary endings linked to background characters which is pretty impressive tbh. About the ending I've chose (spoilers mah bois), [spoiler] after a rough start of doing everthing I could to help It\u014d leading to horribles consequences, after all the efforts of getting back on tracks thinking if I couldn't help myself I could help the others, during the final showdown between It\u014d and Reina, the game really gave the feels I've haven't done this much to help someone that ruined the character's life. The \"Alone Toghter\" ending, which is the first I chose was so powerful, well written, so satisfying and, oh boi, those feels. Those damn feels [/spoiler].\n\nNeutrals.\n\u25ba User Interface hitboxes, even if I have said the UI looks good, it unfortunately, sometimes, has bugged hitboxes, leading to pick the wrong button. Also, on some startup, the location info seems bugged leading to everyplace is called \"<LOCATION>\" or something like that.\n\u25ba Game design new trends, like placing a puzzle with lights in the middle of a chase or put longass but interesting stories when approching the end. It's not a bad point because it keeps us on track with the game, it's just a little underwhelming, which, I think, was the point.\n\nCons.\n\u25ba Unnecessary \"jumpscares\", it's not proper jumpscares hopefully but I got startled every single time from the beginning to the moment you have to pack things in your office (because I don't found any of them later) leading me to be really tense up to the end. Shoutout to the flashing mask in a deep dialogue in the sewer tho.\n\u25ba Resolutions settings, there is N O N E.\n\u25ba Dialogue interface that rarely mixes the person that speaks or rarely forget to add your interlocutor sprite.\n\u25ba Dialogue interface hiding UI and other gamebreaking bugs, while the previous cons doesn't really affect the game, those will make you restart a new game  because they lead to corrupted savegame files, as far from what I heard. For exemple,  [spoiler] the pills scence have the dialogue interface bugged, so you must try to click the doorknob in blurry mess if you want to got to another place which will creat a new clean savefile [/spoiler]. Hopefully the devs, that have acknowledged it, are working on it.\n\nTL;DR.\nIf you're startled at almost anything I still will recommend you Tokyo Dark with all my heart due to his great storyline, possibilities, great detective aspect, uniqueness and non horror clich\u00e9 game design. And because of It\u014d, of course. If devs read this, I want to say thanks a lot, I haven't felt anything in months (I know most of the others players wouldn't felt as much as I did playing this, but I have been personnaly hit by this game).\n\n94/100", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505206890, "timestamp_created": 1505199087, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2812, "steamid": "76561198036801612", "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 36, "last_played": 1506894042, "playtime_forever": 4680}, "votes_up": 19, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34797349", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516600", "review": "Interesting clicking game.

I have a lot of difficulty just launching the game.

If this happens to you and you have already started the game DON'T VERIFY YOUR GAME FILE INTEGRITY. I made this mistake after going on a walk with my dog.... The game wouldn't load so I tried to verify the files and LOST EVERYTHING. Once the game finally loaded my save was no longer there (I really wish this game supported cloud save). All in all I lost about 3 hours of my time but it was quickly regained since the bulk of it was dialogue and reading that I could skip since I already knew what it said. It was a disappointing error to run into but I am still very much enjoying myself and wholeheartedly recommend the game despite the flaws.\n\n\nIt's not perfect, but damn I'm having a good time.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505096300, "timestamp_created": 1505096300, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 312, "steamid": "76561198020048080", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 999, "last_played": 1506744643, "playtime_forever": 824}, "votes_up": 16, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34850943", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513265", "review": "A point and click adventure I enjoyed quite a bit.

Those will now be haunting you and remember there is only auto-save, you casual.\" For that alone, this casual thanks Tokyo Dark. And with it's fascinating blend of visual novel, point & click puzzle solving (which I usually don't go for), and horror mystery with mechanics bringing back fond memories of Eternal Darkness (you yungun's ask yer folks or nerdier older sibling) this game will suck you in quick. And the multitude of endings will have you coming back for more, so the short playthrough time is a blessing if you want to see it all and still have a life. My only critiques would only be nitpicking about things others might love (I'm back and forth on the artstyle, as an example). \n\nTl;dr your choices actually matter, the storytelling is gripping, and doesn't feel forced.

Mostly, the game leads you by the nose to the next bit of the story with very little freedom.\n\nThere is a karma type system, where the choices you make affect later conversation options and the ending, which seems quite well developed with lots of branching paths. The game also makes a big deal about your \"SPIN\" stats (Sanity, Professionalism, Investigation, Neurosis), but in practice they don't seem to have much impact on gameplay and can largely be ignored.\n\nSo, as a Point and Click Adventure, it fails spectacularly due to the near-complete lack of puzzles, which is why I'm choosing to not recommend it. If however you can accept it as a supernatural thriller \"visual novel\", then I guess you would probably enjoy it and moving around the gameworld does in fairness add a lot to feeling immersed in the story.\n\n(Parently advisory: The story and themes are dark and mature, this is not a game for kids).", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505215531, "timestamp_created": 1505070247, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972276575", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 380, "last_played": 1505068193, "playtime_forever": 267}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34848809", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495952", "review": "I really enjoyed the artwork, music and story of the game.

It'll keep you engaged if your a fan of crime and psychological horror stories. \n\nThe artistic style is not bad as well; it really captures the Tokyo nightlife: Showing the cheerful facade that we associate with the city, while exposing the nasty underbelly with very earthly colors and rushed paint strokes. And finally there is the music, which, personally, really does sell the game: It gives you the pinging sense of dread that something is off.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505459726, "timestamp_created": 1505459726, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198013370266", "num_reviews": 12, "num_games_owned": 577, "last_played": 1505445095, "playtime_forever": 314}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34850465", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477799", "review": "A fantastically tense, unsettling game.
