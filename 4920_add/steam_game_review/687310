You take your sword and walk deep into the ancient dungeons, killing enemies and collecting gold, in order to buy upgrades that'll make the fight with the wizard easier. \n\nThe game is highly challenging with a great variety of enemies that each need different tactics and approach to defeat. A game like this couldn't be without hidden traps that make your precious health drop fast. Losing only takes you back to the last checkpoint, which you can find in the form of a magical orb, so repeating retries won't get you bored at all.\n\nThe graphics are well designed, if you consider the fact that they were hand drawn by the game creator. Do not expect 3D effects or anything spectacular. You don't need those anyway in a game like this.\n\nThe sound effects and the soundtrack, which features ancient Greek tunes. take you back to the 8-bit era.\n\nOverall a great game to have in your collection, especially if you are a fan of metroidvania games and classic old skool gameplay. It also features different endings which raises its replayability value.\n\nThumbs up to the creator!\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504362805, "timestamp_created": 1504362805, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970879158", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 60, "last_played": 1505840267, "playtime_forever": 159}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34684396", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "The game takes place in Greece during Trojan War.
