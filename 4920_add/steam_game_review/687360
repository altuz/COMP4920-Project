You play as a cute lil' drawing of a turtle who must hop between adjacent scraps of paper on a fancy-hatted and whimsical journey. Your turtle can't survive for long without a papery medium to exist within, so you have to tread carefully as you traverse from one adorable drawing to the next. Collectible stickers are dotted throughout a landscape of arts-'n-crafts, and figuring out how to reach each one provides you with a small platforming puzzle. The art style is thoroughly charming and full of often hilarious details (for example your turtle gains some very rad sunglasses while perched upon a skateboard), the soundtrack is simultaneously soothing and funky, and the controls are simple but precise. The game is roughly 20 minutes long, but it's packed with novelty and has a very friendly price at just \u20ac2.\n\nA short but very sweet doodle-based treat, strongly recommended for kids or anyone who enjoys fun, light-hearted loveliness!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506454421, "timestamp_created": 1506454421, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "steamid": "76561197978053026", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 48, "last_played": 1506457043, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35240191", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "Short and Sweet. The music is relaxing and even on a loop I never found it annoying. There aren't any moments of frustration which I have found in many platformers.

I look at it this way, this relaxing experience cost me less than what I pay for coffee daily. I'd say this is a perfect game for if you are dealing with a lot of stress and just need a quick game to calm you down.

The controls are simple in principle, and there is little in the way of threat. The closest to difficulty comes in the form of the slightly frustrating jumping which, as I can only assume was intentional, seems to be based either around physics or some form of momentum as it is kind of floaty. This brings the music back to the fore, as well as the concise length, as any longer or any music less soothing might have resulted in a lot more frustration at what should have been simple jumps. Then again, a game without a challenge is hardly a game, and the challenge in this game is the jumping. All in all, well recommended, and for less than a bottle of fizzy drink I had far more enjoyment. Cannot complain!

You follow the adventure of a cute little turtle doodle in a top hat as you navigated a bunch of post-its, paper scraps, shopping lists and all other sorts, complete with doodles and scribbles on each and every thing you come across. It's short, but it's worth the play. An endearing aesthetic with a charming little soundtrack, with music and sound effects that will make you smile as you play along. Environmental interactions that are amusing, sometimes absurd, and even follow-up jokes that hit home as you continue to play and jump around.\n\nControl is simple, and it doesn't take long to get an idea of how things go. The developer even went so far as to include a *contemplation* control, and it is just about as you would expect.\n\nThe game is silly, which is a strength, and the overall look and feel work well together. I would love to play more someday! Maybe a sequel Jamboree? As it stands, the main con is that the game is short and you'll complete the task within a lunch break, but, that's perfectly fine considering the generous price tag. If you end up liking the game as I did, you'll certainly wish there was more afterwards.
