And the game isn't free. This is the reason of the negative review, basically.\nThis game offers nothing but extremely simplificated graphics and a bunch of questions that you'll find for free on every Google Play Store app or where you want..\nSo paying for this is really not worth to me. Ok, I think I paid this 0,10\u20ac with a 90% coupon from off a random medal, but anyways.. it also has only one achievement completely unrelated to the game, you can answer all wrong choices and still you'll get the only achievement.\nReally bad game with zero effort put in it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507143852, "timestamp_created": 1507143852, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "steamid": "76561198356141989", "num_reviews": 115, "num_games_owned": 225, "last_played": 1507143797, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
