I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but I had assumed that the game would have had a bit more pizzazz to it.\n\nFull disclosure: I sucked at the trivia, so that may have influenced my feelings about the game.\nI bought this game on sale, so I shouldn't complain too much (it normally sells for 99 cents on Steam).\nIt's less than a dollar, so by all means buy it and try it yourself, but don't expect too much.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503836302, "timestamp_created": 1503836302, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197996890045", "num_reviews": 131, "num_games_owned": 2079, "last_played": 1503946805, "playtime_forever": 68}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34343974", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504693", "review": "So, I got this from a sale for like 0,60\u20ac and I got to say it's enjoyable: it's a quiz with super hero questions, what else would you want? There are loads of questions and they're mostly good, although I didn't know anything about Big Hero 6.\nSome of the cons include, but are not limited to:\n- Some factual errors, nothing big, but they stood out to me\n- Spelling errors were pretty frequent\n- Some of the questions were pretty unclear with some out-of-place text in there\n- For my personal taste there was too much questions about actors playing/voicing the characters compared to questions about the characters themselves\n\nDespite those I enjoyed this. It's a fun little quiz with a lot of replay value. Just hoping for a patch to be released with some corrections to the problems mentioned above and maybe some more questions, because variety is never a bad thing in these kinds of games.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503124914, "timestamp_created": 1503124914, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198004327266", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 79, "last_played": 1503124284, "playtime_forever": 38}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
