I felt this game was a bit of a hassle just to move. A tutorial in the game would be quite helpful, even if it was initally a port from the Android/iPhone mobile consoles. What I liked best about it? The Yandere is much more appealing and cuter than the Yandere in Yandere Simulator based on the 2D CG scenes I've looked at. As for the actual 3D model of her? She needs a lot of improvement, especially to match her 2D counterpart. Another good thing is being able to listen in on conversations on your way to kill your target. It adds depth to the other characters surrounding the Yandere and makes them more than just NPCs that you can dodge and hide from. For $9.99? I am going to have to confess, I would only pay half for this game after giving it a shot.\n\nFor those curious. I no longer support Yandere Simulator after reading about what the developer has done on Kiwifarms and Pretty Ugly Little Liars.", "votes_down": 21, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506266797, "timestamp_created": 1504812475, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198203920911", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 15, "last_played": 1504811847, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 32, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35362224", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503931", "review": "not worth the $9.99 the free simulator is way better. when i kill people in sim if others see me do it shit can happen not like school where i kill someone and people just run away. nothing happened in school they ran and i was fine.\n\ngameplay of the free Yendere simulator. way better for free\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0WAq3McVdg&feature=youtu.be", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506828476, "timestamp_created": 1506828419, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "steamid": "76561198085045446", "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 221, "last_played": 1506827593, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34841079", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471443", "review": "its amazing!!!!", "votes_down": 20, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504973925, "timestamp_created": 1504973925, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198386250685", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 3, "last_played": 1504930428, "playtime_forever": 67}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34747386", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481860", "review": "Yandere  school Is  very short  game  that takes the  yandere  Japanese character archetype .   \nof the Yandere  girl  more information on character archetypes can be found here .  \nhttp://kotaku.com/how-to-identify-popular-Japanese-character-types-1169085239  \nThe game is fully voice acted however   most if not all of the game speech gets repeated during the game .   \nThe  protagonist in this game is  a girl  in love with a boy and  as is typical of the archetype she  gets rid of her perceived rivals for the boys affections by killing them .  Its a stealth game of sorts and the game play is very basic .  You get a  cartoon picture   showing  the reason that the protagonist feels her latest target should be killed of along with voice acting.   Then you find the murder weapon   find your latest target kill them bury the body in the  garden  . Go to confess your love to your love interest ask him out on a date    Repeat .    \n  \nThe game is very easy to get through  and   the game almost pretty much tells you what to do through    Akari Furutaka's \nthoughts which are represented  as animated  text in thought  bubbles  but at the same time are spoken by the voice actress  example talking about a particular target      \" The baseball bat on the baseball field  might be a good weapon\"   \n\" I think she might be in the cafeteria\"      \nThis aspect of the game can get annoying  to some people  as the game repeat's  speech   particularly  when  a certain action is needed to complete  a chapter .  while carrying a body to the  garden  Akari Furutaka's   will repeat quite frequently  \" I must bury the body \"    \n\nThe  game does have some incentives for  reply. but not very many  there  are  a series of uniforms  and accessory's that you can purchase Using in game currency that you  get by completing game chapters or by doing school test\n \n\n to change the look of the protagonist . I also noticed when I changed the type of school uniform i had on all the female game sprites changed theirs as well.    There are 3 achievements you have to look for in the game to get all  the game achievements  ,  \n  \nI enjoyed this game I liked the voice acting  particularly the  way the voice actress portrayed   \nAkari Furutaka   Which was sort of a  very dead pan voice which reminded you of a low growl of a very large dog a sort of  female version of the hit man voice if you have ever played those games .   \n  \nI don't know if it was intentional or not  but a lot of the humor in the game at least for me was the  rather  under reaction of  the  non game characters when  Akari Furutaka  screws up by committing a murder in front of someone walking in front of them with a dead body or forgetting to hide a murder weapon.   \n  \nwhen you bring a shovel in to school  the way the other characters say \" are you going to  kill someone \"    Its almost as if they are asking you  about a common every day action like are you going to lock up your bike or whatever.   or \" I did not know  their was a gardening club in school \"    \nSame goes for when a student sees you murdering someone  \"  Teacher something bad happened you should see this\"    As if   a student spilled ink on their desk or whatever.    \n  \nhowever due to  the lack of game content  and the limited incentives for  replay I suggest to wait till this game is on sale .  Hopefully   A  workshop will be created for it  or more game content can be added .  \n  \n I personally would like her to have the ability to confess to a teacher or the principal when she  kills more than her target .  with perhaps some creative consequences .    Or to comit suicide by jumping off the roof or hanging herself or something.", "votes_down": 27, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504578458, "timestamp_created": 1504574163, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198141804718", "num_reviews": 63, "num_games_owned": 162, "last_played": 1505420844, "playtime_forever": 1039}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
