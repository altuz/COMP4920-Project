After beating it, I'm here to tell you to SAVE YOUR MONEY. This game is AWFUL!!! Where do I start?\n\nStory:\n\nYou're Rico Rodriguez, you work for the \"Agency,\" and you're called to a fictional island by your superior to overthrow a dictator who possesses weapons of mass destruction. That's all you need to know, and it's probably all you'll remember. Cutscenes and short and feel rushed, and each one boils down to Rico receiving similar orders while often being patronized. Mission types are: fetch quests, eliminations, and base destructions/takeovers. Main and side missions are very dull and repetitive, and the game plays out so slowly that you may just forget what you're doing in any given mission as you succumb to the boredom.\n\nGameplay:\n\nDriving- Some of the worst mechanics you'll find. Steering is extremely frustrating. The slightest turn sends Rico into a 360 spin and triggers a slo-mo camera effect. Nearly all the vehicles look and feel the same, save for specialized vehicles. They really differ in speed, and the slower ones are a NIGHTMARE to drive. Slower vehicles like trucks will stop in the middle of the road on uphill drives, which makes pursuits 1,000,000x worse. If you happen to veer off road and are about to slide off the face of a mountain, you can't drive back up. Despite your best efforts you'll only fall and trigger another annoying slo-mo sequence on the way down. When you hit the ground, your car will ricochet and bounce around like a Fisher Price toy. It's both annoying and funny and I hate myself for laughing when it happens.\n\nPursuits also make fetch quests or missions where you need your vehicle intact absolute nightmares. Enemies respawn infinitely in this game, and the game LOVES to drop enemies RIGHT IN YOUR FACE. You'll constantly find yourself in situations where maybe you're low on health or your vehicle is almost destroyed, and from nowhere comes 3 vehicles with NPCs on the mounted guns to put you out of your misery, or two choppers to fire missiles at you with surgical precision. Vehicles in general don't feel very fast, but let an NPC get behind the wheel and suddenly gain godlike speed and handling. In several pursuits, enemies have gotten into cars and within 0.73 seconds have rammed and boxed me in. What's more is that there is no drive by shooting... for you. Enemies can do it, but you can't, so have fun with that!\n\nSome vehicles are bugged. On several occasions I've gotten into a vehicle that won't even move. Once, I even hopped into an APC tank just to get launched and start flying across the map. I couldn't make this up if I tried!\n\nCombat- EXTREMELY dull. Every pistol and rifle feel the same. The game promises better weapons as you progress, but don't hold your breath. You'll spot the cookie cutter thing going on with each gun.\n\nRico is extremely squishy and takes very little effort to kill. This will be the MAIN SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION for you throughout the game. From the jump, enemies eat headshots for breakfast, and must be engaged at mid-range whether you're using a pistol or rifle. They become more and more bullet spongey throughout the game, while you become squishier.\n\nAnything you drive will be shot down within seconds during pursuits, and you can take damage while driving. When your car turns pitch black and it's time to bail, you'll be surrounding by one of the never-ending spawns of enemies and finished off. This will happen to you AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN, and you'll rip out your hair or some other appendage before you break your monitor and beat your pc to death with a sledgehammer.\n\nGrappling hook- It was obvious that this was supposed to be the game's one quirk, something to set itself apart from the competition, and boy does it SUCK! It's not a separate action and has to be selected from your weapons cycle. It's only meant to latch onto vehicles, which it does %40 of the time. You can reel into or push yourself away from attached vehicles, but often the hook disengages before you can do anything, making it a very unreliable tool. If you do reel in close enough, you can hop onto the attached vehicle and hijack it. Often when I got the prompt to jump onto the attached vehicle, Rico would perform a Hulk-style leap across the map to jump on a totally different vehicle and take me further from my destination. Good luck trying to hitch onto aircraft for a ride too. The game has a feature that allows you to call in Agency vehicles to your location, and once it arrives you can hook onto it and catch a ride, but this is only good if you're lucky enough to have the chopper depart toward your destination. You can try hitching onto enemies\u2019 choppers too, but when you do, they just shake the line. If you're lucky enough to reach the cabin, Rico will commit suicide by flinging himself into the blades. The hook is a complete and utter failure, driving mechanics are god awful, and Rico's run is little more than a glorified snail's pace. Traversing this world in any method is a complete pain.\n\nOverall:\n\nI can honestly say I've never played a game where every single thing you do is a complete chore. From movement to combat to story missions, every aspect of this game is either dull or broken. AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS. Take your $7 and get yourself some lunch instead. The game could go on sale and still be overpriced. This game could be free and still be overpriced. The devs should be PAYING YOU to play this garbage, and even then, you'd still lose because that's time that you could spend playing games that are better than a solid -1/10.\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505751103, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494051", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35048296", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198126376681", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1503244533, "num_games_owned": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 410}, "timestamp_updated": 1505751103, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good for a game this old"}]}
