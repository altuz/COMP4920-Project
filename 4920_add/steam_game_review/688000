There isn't much to say about it: there is no coherent story, there are no interesting characters, there are very few situations when you really have to consider every option. Maybe it was my bad luck, but I could hardly make anyone fall in love with my character (despite all my effort). The original idea of the game sounds fresh and promising, but in the end it looks like a wasted opportunity.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502502392, "timestamp_created": 1502502392, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198278282775", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 19, "last_played": 1502501112, "playtime_forever": 749}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34163807", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519393", "review": "Overall I would not recommend it, the storyline is very dry with absolutely no focus at all, the main storyline is non existent, and the characters are very bland with almost no personality, the demo is a pretty good representation of the game, since the quality does not improve after the demo, so if you enjoyed the demo, I reckon you might want to buy this game for $3 to support the developer.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1502440496, "timestamp_created": 1502440496, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198213186949", "num_reviews": 16, "num_games_owned": 40, "last_played": 1502439900, "playtime_forever": 63}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34364236", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505148", "review": "One of the best COG games I've had the pleasure to play this year. The replayability value is pretty high, too, as different choices end up producing a meaningfully different character arc for your thief-taker.
