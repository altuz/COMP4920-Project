However it is made to be played with a controller of some sorts. I wouldn't recommend playing with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nThis game does take a bit of getting used to but once you get used to it, it's an overall fun game to hunt down your enemy and blap them in the face. Valkyrie has a good selection of drones. All with their own learning curve, along with learning how to pilot the drones. The ship tree adds a nice touch allowing you upgrade your ship with exp that you get from matches. Be warned most upgrades come at a cost to something, let that be less shield but more rate of fire.\n\nLoot boxes are a nice touch, really no pay to win aspect, other then getting some implants to boost your exp gain in order to upgrade the ships further fast then getting exp from a match.\n\nThe map selection and overall game modes are fun. You get put into a lobby and the game mode that you grt each time is different then before. Games can range from 5 minutes to bed 10 minutes depending if you are playing extraction or carrier attack.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game.

Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, House of the Dying Sun, you name it I probably have it. I also have a fairly high end system. I have a Thrustmaster Warthog stick and throttle, I have pedals, I have multiple ultrawide monitors, TrackIR and Eye Tracking. These things all add to the experience when playing the games I enjoy. The difference between Elite, Star Citizen, and any other space sim between playing it the normal way and playing it at 7680x1080 with head tracking and HOTAS is huge.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I get a game that, for all intents and purposes, should match its competition, or at least the games where it's going to be attracting players from, and it falls completely short. I want a game like EVE: Valkyrie. I want to be able to just sit down, hop in a dogfighting match, and then be able to stop at any point to go deal with real life. EVE Online doesn't support this well, and neither does Elite Dangerous (RIP CQC). Star Citizen does with Arena Commander though.\n\nAs a warning to anyone expecting what every other space sim out there supports. There is not just no Eyefinity/Surround support, there is no 21:9 support. Huge amounts of text are just completely off screen if you play in 21:9. It does the Overwatch FOV thing, except the entire UI gets zoomed in on. It's terrible. There is no good joystick support. If you have a HOTAS, or heaven forbid a HOTAS + pedals, good luck getting it to recognize more than one device at a time. It doesn't. Also don't expect any kind of non-VR head tracking. This one is almost the most disappointing to me. If the game supports VR head tracking, why wouldn't it support TrackIR or the Tobii Eye Tracker. Those are far cheaper alternatives to VR head tracking for those of us like myself that also don't want to be strapped in to a headset, but this actually puts everyone without VR at a disadvantage because there is no way to look around the same way.\n\nI can't recommend this game right now. There are huge features missing that should be included nowadays. The menus are incredibly difficult to navigate, especially with mouse and keyboard. I hate to use the trope so many fall back on but, the game feels like a console port, designed for console controllers, brought to a PC ecosystem where the most diehard of spacesim fans are going to find all their favorite hardware rendered useless.\n\nIf you're looking for a dogfighting simulator that has those things (multimon, ultrawide, head tracking and joystick support), despite all the bugs and the alpha state, Star Citizen is further along in this regard, and overall feels like a more polished product. Needless to say I am highly disappointed that a game with inconsistent frame rates, desktop crashing bugs and other various issues feels like a more finished product than one that's actually released, especially from CCP, who I've supported for so long.", "votes_down": 28, "language": "english", "comment_count": "11", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506537499, "timestamp_created": 1506536673, "developer_response": "Hi Pilot, thanks for the feedback. \n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Today's EVE: Valkyrie - Warzone patch includes mouse & keyboard control improvements, and other handy fixes. https://www.evevalkyrie.com/articles/updates-and-patches/eve-valkyrie-warzone-patch-2017_r4-1\n\nWe absolutley hear you on the controller and head tracking feedback and we're monitoring it closely at the studio. EVE: Valkyrie \u2013 Warzone is still currently in active development at our studio in Newcastle, and we will be working closely with our community to fine tune this configuration following any feedback we receive.\n\nAs I mentioned on reddit, we are not a flight sim, we have always focused on a more arcade-style flight model that best compliments our blend of visceral dogfighting. We can\u2019t strafe in our ships as this is a key cause of nausea in VR, and we wanted gameplay parity across all hardware (Cross-Play, Cross-Reality). We share a lot of DNA with FPS style shooters, but we are not an FPS \u2013 so players expecting to turn 180 degrees with the flick of a mouse will find they are restricted by the physics of our flight model (we are steering a vehicle, not turning the head/arms of an avatar).\n\nWe are also looking to patch in additional features which may help Mouse & Keyboard players further e.g. an Escalator key which (when pressed) will continually move in the direction that the Mouse is moving in until released.\n\n o7\n", "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 774, "steamid": "76561197978509870", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 1002, "last_played": 1506566039, "playtime_forever": 771}, "votes_up": 47, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35341069", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523678", "review": "Short version: the transition from a VR-only game to a non-VR game still needs a lot of work.\n\nWhile it is admirable that CCP attempted to revamp Eve: Valkyrie to make it more accessible to those who don\u2019t have the gear, the game suffers from an incomplete transition. A gorgeous game, play is still hampered by the original design based on VR \u2013 players situational awareness is derived from looking around and that is lost when played on a 2d screen.\nIgnoring the frustrating menu issues (a mix of grid and \u201clazy susan\u201d navigation which don\u2019t work together with a single control scheme, at the moment) which can be addressed short term, the key failing is giving non-VR players the situational awareness required for this sort of game.\n\nBeing unable to change from a fixed-forward field of vision, having a HUD that supplies information about what is happening around the player is key. The HUD as currently implemented leaves a lot to be desired.\nThe \u201cradar\u201d at the moment shows coloured triangles: no distance or relative position indications are anywhere to be found. Designs for a 3D degree radar have been solved over many games over many years so I am at a loss as to why this particular design wasn\u2019t enhanced for 2D screens. As it is, it just takes up screen real-estate and doesn\u2019t provide much in terms of information to the player.\n\nWhich leaves the HUD as the primary means the player must identify both friendly and enemy position and bearing and that falls woefully short. The off-screen indicators (triangles at the edge of a circle in the HUD) does provide a direction and even how far behind a player ship is (by the number of triangles used) but does nothing to indicate distance: you could see five enemy fighters are outside of your field of vision, get an idea if they are above or directly behind you, but no indication how far or near they are.\n\nWhen a ship enters the field of view, they are too easily lost on the screen: the triangle disappears and is replaced by \u2026 a dot. Sure, if the ship is close enough you can see the ship but with the various objects and colours in the arena, they can be easily lost.\n\nThe third necessity is knowing if and when you are being hit and an attempt is made to use audio cues (although some ships specifically do this silently) to do this. However, the sound design of being hit is indistinguishable in the barrage of tones being played for things like target lock, missile lock, etc and the direction fire is coming from is only indicted by flashing arrows if the ship is off screen. Again, being locked into the forward view prevents the player from doing the shoulder checks that can be done with VR.\n\nThe game does have some potential. The variety of games modes are fun, the number and diversity of ships allows players to experiment with different ships and find a playstyle they like and the game does look absolutely gorgeous.\n\nBut without the ability to look around using other means besides a full VR rig combined with the lackluster HUD and audio cues the potential for the game (and for keeping a player base) is lost. I will be keeping an eye on what CCP does with EVE: Valkyrie as I do think the issues I have with it are solvable (and in many cases have already been solved in other titles). In the meantime, I\u2019ll just stay in my clone vat.\n\n", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506782972, "timestamp_created": 1506782972, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "steamid": "76561197991546378", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 257, "last_played": 1506780826, "playtime_forever": 286}, "votes_up": 18, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35231391", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507700", "review": "The game itself is a fun concept, the gameplay is interesting. \nAlthough I haven't played it too long and cant give a full review, I have to say the menu system is absolutely awful. \nYou have to scroll multiple times to move a menu item instead of it just being once, some people would call this 'heavy'.

It is clear that it was designed as a VR game first and as such the menu and more needs work. \nKnowing CCP this game will be continuously improved with features and gameplay, I look forward to seeing what comes!

Squad creation - In the old version, you could invite your Steam friends to squad, but there was no way to determine in game whether they were online. That meant you had to talk to them on steam or discord, agree to play together, then hunt them down in the list in Valkyrie and invite them. \nOtherwise, you could go down your list of frowns and send them all invites, hoping a few night happen to be playing right now and join your squad.  \n\nNow, your list of friends highlights the ones who are currently playing the game, which makes it MUCH easier to connect. \n\n2. Squad function - In the old version you couldn't really communicate with your squad, but they were highlighted in yellow and you also had floating tags on your periphery to indicate their direction, if you weren't facing them. Communication limited to selection of canned messages (help me, or join up for an attack run, I need healing, etc), but those were clunky to use. It's become routine to use Discord for voice come, but that needs to be pre-arranged.\n\nNow, the helpful floating tags on the periphery have been removed (why!?), but the canned messages are much easier to use (but still unlikely to use in the middle of an intense dogfight when you need them most). Not sure if this was in the original, but the canned messages also tag you to your mates so they can easily find you. Discord still works for voice coms and adds a LOT to squad effectiveness and to the general experience of the game. Still no way in game to tell teammates to join you on a discord channel - if CCP can't deliver this functionality in - game, they should allow you to create a canned message with a link to a private discord voice channel so you can  more easily get your squad or teammates into that work around. \n\n3. Ship selection - In the old version you unlocked new ships and new capabilities for ships as you earned XP. Kind of annoying if you couldn't put tons of hours into the game, especially since some ships seemed seriously OP. Ship differentiation was ok, with three major functions of ship that made interesting dynamics in game. \n\nNow, this is where the Warzone update really shines, because all ships are unlocked (and each has to be individually leveled up with its own upgrade tree). Upgrades are mice enough to be noticeable but not OP, so far. And the variety of ships! Sniper ships. Healer ships. Ships that can cloak. Ships that can find the cloaked ships. Missile ships that pack a punch but are made of paper. Ships that are basically tanks. A variety of fighters for different combat styles. This is now Overwatch in space, and it is awesome!\n\nBetter visibility into ship features while you're actually selecting one (in a mission, when you're trying to address a problem) and the option to delay launch in order to do so would be great. I love the dramatic presentation of ship abilities in the pre-mission hangar, but give us something in between during matches so we can quickly hunt down a counter strategy in-game.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506696673, "timestamp_created": 1506646628, "developer_response": "Really glad you're enjoying it.

I am an avid EVE player.  3000+ hours.

It is so wonderful to see this universe from a new perspective.\n\nBUT!  I find this title severly lacking in content.  And the multiplayer is as good or less than that of games that are free to play.  In my honest and unbiased opinion, this title seems like a gimic that cashed in early on the VR craze.  If I had VR I am sure I would find this a lot more fun...or a lot more nausiating.  There is a lot of spinning involved in those dog fights and barf bags should come standard in your ships, or at least an attachment on the VR headset.  Note the time and date of this review in case someone makes that!  My idea!  Mine!\n\nSo anyways, do I think the title was worth 30 dollars?  No, not really enough content to make it worth the price.  Is there room for this title to improve?  Hell yeah, and I have faith that CCP could get it done!  Do I recommend it?

I've only poked around and played through the tutorial stuff here for about an hour, but my initial impressions are going to be heavily influenced by my bittervet-ness.  I don't have VR and have only played with mouse/keyboard so far.  I've got a semi-HOTAS setup that I'll configure later when I'm not being lazy and have had a few less beers. (also I think this is one of my first Steam reviews and am likewise being lazy with the formatting)\n\nPros:  \n* easy to get into and just start flying\n* flying around in EVE settings (I'll recommend buying to fellow pilots on this alone)\n* better appreciation for what my drones and fighters have to go through popping rats, especially in belts\n\nCons / could use improvement:\n* my only serious complaint so far is the overly busy and wonky UI.  I know it was made for VR originally, so maybe that's to blame, but it's already hurting my brain.\n* Wyvern looks too short and too wide\n* no ship spinning and space-Barbie mode seems lacking as well\n* ship upgrades could have more depth and open-endedness instead of the mostly linear progression tree\n* base ship skins should be the Empire colors or their faction derivatives\n* I wish it was directly connected with EVE\n\nSummary:  I know I have more cons than pros, but this is also from the perspective of wanting it to be an organic part of EVE, which it is not.  On its own merits, it seems like a pretty decent fun game and I'd recommend buying if you want some quick space pewpew.  For EVE pilots, I'd also recommend buying on the extra lore/game tie-in alone.
