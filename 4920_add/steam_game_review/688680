Something decent in RPG-maker games! :)\n\nI love the game because I think it's got justttt the right balance ( / amount of playtime for the price, and grinding, and rather-simple storyline, etc). It also got a reasonable amount of achievements for the amount of playtime spent... and the story is not your typical RPG-maker \"mushy\" storyline.\n\nDuring my playtime and journey to 100% achievements, I also did not encounter any bugs... This is very important to me, as I get easily annoyed / irritated when I find bugs in the game that I have purchased.\n\nP.S. I'm also loving the newest Patch 1.3... Thanks Dev team for the awesome added battle backgrounds!\n\nOverall = I had fun & yes, I will recommend it, especially to those who like short RPG games / old-school type.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506354395, "timestamp_created": 1506354225, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "steamid": "76561198417207011", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 65, "last_played": 1506353219, "playtime_forever": 996}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34815094", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494354", "review": "*touches a horse*\ngot an achievement...\nNICE!!!", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504879077, "timestamp_created": 1504879077, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "steamid": "76561198248033398", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 21, "last_played": 1506166382, "playtime_forever": 589}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
