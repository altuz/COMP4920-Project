However when playing I had a beer before that and didn't think about that before playing. With that said and out of the way, that is one of the only downsides so far. \n\nInfinity Fall brins a new kind of way to move around in the VR world, and it is a lot of fun / exilerating to move around in this game. However, pace yourself / play in short intervals because it doesn't feel right when half your body goes through the ground. I found the best way to handle this is to sit / neal on the ground to prevent your mind from being tricked. Keep the room you are playing in cool, and take breaks often.\n\nThe game has its pros and cons and I give them credit for the unique concept.\n\nPros:\n-A lot of fun to move around at high velocity\n-Gunplay is great and distracts your mind a bit from some sickening points\n-I have no idea what is thrilling about moving at high velocities at walls/floors but I love it.\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay starts out slow and took awhile before enemies were introduced\n-I have to play in small intervals to prevent sickness", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504415316, "timestamp_created": 1504403880, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198058846554", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 354, "last_played": 1504397125, "playtime_forever": 27}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
