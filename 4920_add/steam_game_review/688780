Some say I need a key and some say they can only be opened from the other side, but I'm not entirely sure where the other side is. \n\nGraphics: Graphics: Pixel art is fine I suppose. Enemies are nonsense, one of them appears to be a floating wheel; but on the other hand that might've been what the dev was going for. \n\nStory: What do you expect? Shoot the enemies and win.\n\nGameplay: You can obtain a variety of weapons with which to kill enemies. Or at least, I assume you can. I've only found the shotgun because as I mentioned, I can't get anywhere. Biggest complaint is that your bullets come out the barrel of your gun, which is fine on its own but your character apparently thinks it's a good idea to press the stock of his gun up to his chest. Another complaint is that ladders have asymmetrical and dilapidated appearance, which I like but you can only actually climb in areas where you can see ladder, so you end up having to move around a lot just to climb. \n\nSound: I'm going to level with you here, dev: the sound is terrible. My character makes sounds like Steve from the Minecraft Alpha when he's hit. Perhaps make the hits sound like something actually getting hit, as opposed to the sound one makes when they're hit.\n\nOverall though I think it has a huge amount of potential if it's polished a lot more. If it has a bit more work put into it, it'll definitely be worth the money.\n\nP.S. Note to the Dev: First of all, you should add some more tags to your game. It doesn't even show up under Indie. Second of all, come on mate. How hard is it to find free screen recording software?
