Well, that's this game. It's just finding keys and opening doors along with botched enemies that are stuck through the floors and in the walls and even when they're not, they can't move properly. It tries so hard to be like an LSD trip but it just comes off as tacky. I spent like 25 minutes of my life playing through this only to realise that the achievements are all broken.
