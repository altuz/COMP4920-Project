Playing this game with friends makes it 10x more fun obviously. There's the offline campaign mode if you are playing solo, which is fun, but there aren't many levels yet. Might find a bug here and there, everytime I report one it gets fixed pretty quickly though. \n\nMy conclusion:\n\n- One of my favourite games to play with friends.\n- Since the game is in early access they are still adding new stuff.\n- Bugs might happen but none stay forever.\n- Can't wait to play the official release!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506293953, "timestamp_created": 1506293953, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 532, "steamid": "76561198074979592", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 24, "last_played": 1506777603, "playtime_forever": 532}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34986692", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498235", "review": "First day game came out\nand I have a question,how do I get the cape the comes with early acess?\n\nEdit1: Very fun!
