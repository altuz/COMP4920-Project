Music is great.\n4. Great Story element. \n5.The Characters powers.\n6. The first boss does something amazing when he kills you.\n\n\nCons.\n1. The controls. \n2. Damage seems a bit high.\n3. Bosses feel the same across the board.\n4. No customization. sounds, difficulty, controls.\n5. Buggy. Getting stuck in rocks. \n\n\nMy overall opinion. Play it. \nThis game feels like alot of love and care went in to it and it shows. This needs some work on the gameplay level with the controls being really hard to get used to. Couple bugs that forced me to restart the level. I love the mix of characters, the art and music are all great. I plan to sink alot of hours in this game untill I beat it.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504404129, "timestamp_created": 1504404129, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198177910290", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 40, "last_played": 1504403148, "playtime_forever": 247}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34672231", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491274", "review": "Edit: Review updated with feedback.\n\nRavager is a simplistic action-adventure game, with basic skills and combo-based combat, and a mythological (and presumably epic, i havent actually gotten past level 1) story.\n\nPros and Cons:\nDefinitive Pros:\n+Artstyle is beatiful\n+Gameplay is so simple a rock could play it in the early game.\n+Gameplay mechanics get more complex as you progress.\n+Good soundtrack\n\nOpinionated Pros:\n+PROPERLY DONE Norse mythology is few and far between.\n\nDefinitive Cons:\n-a few bugs. Okay, maybe a couple dozen over a few, I only encountered two however.\n-Options menu is sub-par.\n-First level is a massive pain.\n\nOpinionated Cons:\n-Gameplay is so simple a rock could play it early on.\n-I think the soundtrack would be a bit better with a \"Viking Metal\" version during combat.\n\nNotes:\nTo the devs: Add a difficulty option, with the current difficulty as something like Tavern Maid, and even higher modes, like V\u00edkingr and Ravager. Doom style, except with a New-Game plus mode. capisce? Also maybe Mutators for said NG+.\n\nOriginal review was horrid. <_< [spoiler] You've been warned: http://archive.is/cnBmJ [/spoiler]", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": "6", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504821925, "timestamp_created": 1504310551, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198065367451", "num_reviews": 31, "num_games_owned": 262, "last_played": 1504309777, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
