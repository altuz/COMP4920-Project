There is no leaderboard system, but instead a local \"High Scores\" page. The game seems to run at about 30 frames per second on a fairly modern rig on the highest quality, even though the graphics are kind of lacking. Worth the price tag, but I don't see myself doing a second playthrough.\n\nThe game feels pretty repetitive, and kind of loses its appeal after playing ten levels in a row, with the only difference between them being how many of each ability you can use, and how many things you need to destroy to beat the level.\nThere is no way of knowing how close you are to finishing the game, and even when you do, it is rather confusing, as you end up [spoiler]with your island sinking into the ocean, then[/spoiler] at the High Scores screen to input your name with nothing informing you that you have won.

My work here is done!\n\nThe game is pretty simple, but fun.  You are the volcano and you have four main tools to work with: magma rock (launch a giant molten boulder followed by a lava flow), eruptions (lava flows), fissures (earthquake, which also seems to ignite huts...but not trees), and lightning (volcanic lightning barrage).  Each level allots you a limited number of uses of various combinations of the above-mentioned tools.  You must use the tools allotted to you for that particular level to meet your destruction quota (destory X number of buildings, kill X islanders, etc).  If you fail, you lose one \"life\" (you start the game with 10 lives).  If you succeed, you move on to the next level.  You apparently score points based on the amount of wanton destruction you unleash.  That's pretty much it.  The graphics are pretty simple, but it suits the game.

Its basically the same level, over and over again, but with different amount of times you can use your \"volcano powers.\" And there are four. Only four volcano powers. There is a lava bomb (which throws a giant rock and shoots lava), an eruption (which...also shoots lava, but MORE), an earthquake, and a lightning barrage. Now I don't know about you, but it is odd that every volcano in fiction has lava out the wazoo, when lava isn't even the most dangerous thing a volcano can throw at you. Where are pyroclastic flows? Lahars? Deadly ash clouds? These could replace the lava in the eruption attack. \n\nThe game is something of  a resource management puzzle, where you need to destroy a certain amount of things and people using the attacks you have available. However while entertaining for a while, it quickly got stale when I realized there were no more volcano abilities to unlock. \n\nIf you like mindless destruction then this is the game for you. But if you kinda came into this as more of a geology nerd then I guess lower your expectations. \n\nOther thoughts that are really just my own preferences:\n\n-Kinda wish there was a way to mute the screams separately from all the other sound effects. I kinda am a wimp who likes to think all video game enemies just sort of poof. \n-I'd like to see more variety in the color, shape, and layout of your volcanic island between each level. Some more types of volcanoes would also be neat if possible.\n-Volcanoes controlling faultlines? SACRE BLEU!
