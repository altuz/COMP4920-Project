Almost unplayable and one of the worst Early Access Titles we have seen to date.  Avoid at all costs for now.\n\nTerrible hit detection from both bullets and melee attacks.  Weapons do not drop from the sky and are therefore unable to be acquired by the player.  The gun shoots a little red dot as its bullet and when you aim at an enemy you almost never hit it because the bullets seem to be repelled by enemies.\n\nGames like this should not be available until they have the basic gameplay elements in tact so they can at least be played without causing immense bouts of rage quitting.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505248641, "timestamp_created": 1505248641, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198142433450", "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 154, "last_played": 1505247265, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 24, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34908736", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520715", "review": "NEEDS ALOT OF WORK!\ncrashes on fullscreen (for me) \nno sounds but the buzzing of something and some zombies.\nso, if you want it WAIT FOR IT TOO GET BETTER.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505251207, "timestamp_created": 1505251207, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198251732544", "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 37, "last_played": 1505251138, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 13, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34984494", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "review": "thus game is baiscly a h1z1 parody", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505522662, "timestamp_created": 1505522662, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198320704051", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 3, "last_played": 1505516161, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34912240", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466524", "review": "alright i was looking forward to seeing thisgame. i do wish you did spend a bit more time making this. i got a list of thigns i hope you can fix soon. 1 starting the game off isvery very hard. you can not even leave your tent to expolre unless you get a turret. 2 theres aglitch were i start the game andget reset back to the menu to build and customize your toon. 3rd guns floating in the air is a issue too. i would like to see youadd in a locker for storing guns for later and more to the tothe customizaton. i do hope this helps you and other players who come along and try this game.
