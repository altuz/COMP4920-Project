Especially for an early access title the mechanics, the gameplay loop, strategies forming in my mind for each situation -- they are present and far above \nthe average indie game released in todays Steam marketplace.\n\nGraphics feel polished, the soundtrack is great and the complete aesthetic really feels like an upper tier AA developer. While only knowing of this games existence a few days ago, my interest was piqued and with an hour hands on now -- I can safely say this not only is staying on my hard drive but also in my rotation of games I play for myself -- not just coverage.\n\nWhile the only thing lacking substance is map variety and future modes -- but already has me excited to approac this a la Rocket League where each update gets me wanting to get back on the grind.\n\nPlease take the risk, please get this games userbase to grow. While not the easiest game to explain why it feels so good, it's just a situation where the stars aligned to form an exceptional product. Pending a structured content drip, this game deserves success.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6wPgNTl-O8k\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507144844, "timestamp_created": 1507144844, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "steamid": "76561198001876420", "num_reviews": 49, "num_games_owned": 552, "last_played": 1507209565, "playtime_forever": 112}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
