At all.\nIt is a pity it had both cute sprites and pictures, cause they seem terribly out of place in this short, shallow game without any substance. It almost seems like everything about this is just excuse to show few sexy pics, but oh man; you can easily find better smut elsewhere. \nSo why that bad? \nFirst, translation - its bad, and makes you constantly wonder what author had in mind. So at some point you just skip through it. Especially because of second problem - the story. It starts slow, has one major plot point that comes out of nowhere and [spoiler] renders the main heroine useless, then one of the guys resolves it by himself behind the scenes just to get his way with her as a reward [/spoiler]. The end. Frankly, its even a bit insulting how obviously whole plot is just excuse to show some (badly translated) sex.\nThis is not worth buying and reading through, honestly.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504602882, "timestamp_created": 1504602882, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016420293", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 325, "last_played": 1504273975, "playtime_forever": 297}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34879134", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "The translation is bad, but its so bad you can't stop laughing.
