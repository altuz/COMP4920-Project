All you do is either click the screen and earn that money and subs. The whole point of a clicker/idle game is that you feel like you are getting somewhere (in a virtual sense) and I didn't feel I was going anywhere in game. If they had a rebirth feature something closer to clicker heroes. I'd play it more often. \n\nAs I said before it is a vey simplistic clicker game (not a good thing all the time). The graphics are nice and all, but I don't see the point in the graphics being so nice if you skimp on the other things lacking in an idle/clicker game. Just look at other clicker games and idle games such as Plantera/Clicker Heroes/Idling to rule the Gods\n\nIf you like cheap games and just want to fill your steam library then this is for you, other than that I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504607325, "timestamp_created": 1504607325, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198047291933", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 30, "last_played": 1504363450, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35259461", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "AWESOME GAME AND ADDICTING.
