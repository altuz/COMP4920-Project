So 4 track content will get 8 tracks, you can solves this by deactivating how the new way AVC is handled. Not sure if this messes with hardware acceleration ect ect.\n\nAnother issues is in the design, Yes it's better overall! But there is a 20px header in every track using up space for both peaks and previews. So if you like me got 2 video tracks and 4 audio tracks you get 120px of deadspace in your timeline for a header that has no real purpose. There needs to be a way to remove it in future updates.\n\nThe good stuff is as mentioned the rest of the UI, i also had a better time with a capture card. Seems like Nvidia graphic cards actually are benefitical in Rendering now! I seen speeds up to 40% faster then Pro 14, that's very much welcome as i know some people using premier just due to rendering speeds.\n\nI personally dont regret buying this as early as i did due the 25% lower price, however i can't really recommend it to anyone until all glitches and small issues has been fixed i really wish there was neutral option when writing reviews.

That isn't to say there isn't a lot of issues with this software. Should I expect more from software that costed me CDN$399? Probably. But VP15 has saved me countless of hours, when it comes to rendering, compared to VP14 & even Premiere Pro CC render times. I now render my videos in 4K 60fps faster than I used to render a 1080p video at 60fps. That is thanks to the increased GPU acceleration and the new Magix rendering option. \n\nSo to make it simple, what are all of the pros and cons? \n\nPROS:\n- Amazing GPU Acceleration (Tested w/ GTX1080 & 980)\n- Improved UI (Dark UI option & more customizable layouts)\n- Overall More Streamlined\n\nCONS: (why I currently don't reccomend buying)\n- A LOT of crashing. When I say \"A LOT,\" I mean A LOT! (Have you ever heard of the FNV G.E.C.K.?) \n- Weird audio issues (e.g. duplicate tracks)\n- User interface bugs (layout windows dissappearing)\n- Thick bars on every track that can't be hidden, wasting precious vertical timeline space\n- Other than UI & amazing renders, not much has changed since VP14\n\nWho should buy this?\n- Anyone wanting a VP/editing software that doesn't own VP13/14...\n- Anyone who needs to upgrade for the render times (keep the crashing in mind)\n- Anyone with a ton of money to blow\n\nI plan on updating this review when (and if) VP15 gets updated to fix the prominent issues.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506886158, "timestamp_created": 1506886158, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 2713, "steamid": "76561198367129686", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 263, "last_played": 1507181604, "playtime_forever": 2713}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
