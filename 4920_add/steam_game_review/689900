The graphics and sound are perfect, plus the voice acting is well done too. Unlike too many point & clicks (not sure why so many fail developing such simple, time-tested controls/UIs), this one nails the user interface where everything just works as you expect it should work. It's user interface also allieviates some of the pain that can come with point & click games such as by providing overlay text for interactable objects so you're not tediously pixel hunting. Searching around for items and interacting with objects is always enjoyable since there's so much uniquely humorous dialog to hear, The writing is very well done - it's clever and amusing with a very cohesive feel. So yeah, I'm impressed... it's not often I get to play a new point & click game that's developed this well.

However...I do feel that it was not worth the full 15$ I think it should've been about 10$ There is a lot of fun in this and some jokes that made me laugh pretty loud. Some of the puzzles are very tedius and hard to figure out and doesn't help when some of the puzzles need some strange logic. I am also dissapointed though with just how little things are explored. (Some spoilers after this point) you meet a guy in the underworld who acts like Cid for the underworld. (maybe swapped for Cid at a young age?) Yet you do nearly nothing with him. You learn no real reason WHY Cid was put in Darkestville, and so many other questions that are left open that bother me. \nNow based on the credits this seemed to have a fairly small team compared to a lot of other games which I can use to explain some things. Though for 15$ I wish that more of the game wasn't static. I wished you could see more things in the background happening, or from time to time a silly animation from a static character while waiting. There was some but not a lot of animation when you weren't involved. The Inventory wasn't bad but I feel that it was a bit tricky and wished their were more lines for when you had the wrong item being used because hearing \"Nope.\" \"Nu-uh\" \"I will not use *Item* here\" got annoying with how often I had to do trial and error to figure it out.\nI noticed the lip movement was odd but I believe that this game isn't originally English so I chock that up to just I'm not playing the native langauge.\nI will also note their is a character name \"Vigo\" and his name throughout the game is pernounced \"V-Go\" but the narrator calls him \"Vi-go\" which just sounded weird. It's more a nitpick but I didn't like it.\nThe game also had a bad habit of red herring hints. There is one character you need to trap and he says something about a Purple Raptor, and another character seems to be that when he sneezes after drinking something Cid had made before he turned into a purple monster. So I spent thirty minutes trying to figure out how to make the thing so he would turn into the monster and could be bait to trap or just lure him away for me. In the end that was a throwaway Line.\nI know this has a lot of negativity but the trailer does show the best parts, Cid is a pretty likable character he is \"Evil\" but not a monster. It started to leave the goofy childish side and get a bit more serious but not enough. \nWhile some of the meta jokes were really funny, others where forced and dissapointing.\nWhat I do hope for though is since Steam says this is like Deponia (good series BTW) that Darkestville Castle fallows in Deponia's footsteps and make a few sequels going on with and improving the story and explaining the backstories of Cid and a few other characters more. I'd love to see Cid do more maybe a level where he is just doing his pranks or so (could've actually been a good tutorial moment) delve into his decisions more, does he stay how he was or does he try to improve himself? \nThis game in the end I think is at LEAST a 6/10 it's not bad, but it clearly has flaws. The things though that appeals to me the most about it is Cid is a great character, the world is intriguing to me, the humor for the most part is good (every comedy has its bad jokes) but the potential sequels are what I hope for. I want to see more of Cid, maybe a spin off or a section in a sequel/prequel where you play as the Romeros (I feel they needed more screen time).\nI am going to keep my eyes open and hope that this becomes a series because Cid the demon of Darkestville deserves love.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506913204, "timestamp_created": 1506913204, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 469, "steamid": "76561198095435153", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 197, "last_played": 1506911775, "playtime_forever": 469}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35175164", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "A great point-and-click adventure game! Darkestville Castle puts you in control of Cid, the demon of Darkestville, a villainous, EVIIILLLL mastermind who delights in making the lives of people as miserable as can be. The game uses the unique style of playing as the villain to create plenty of dark humor and some pretty fun solutions to certain puzzles.\n\nOverall, the story is pretty great though it hardly sticks in the mind after you finish the game only because its pacing (i.e. the narrative's) is pretty fast. But that is to say it can't be enjoyed despite that, it totally can. And, hey, if get stuck on a puzzle and can't progress then there's no better time to enjoy the great art. Character designs are kinda all over the place which means that I found most of the characters not cohesive or they stand out too much from the rest that they're almost jarring. For example, Foxy Romero feels so off compared to most of the other human characters although this does become less of an issue with the demons. Well, of course, because of the fact that they're demons I guess and can have all kinds of shapes and form. Voice acting is ok until you finish the game and then you realize that most of the characters were voiced by just one guy! Who knew? Thanks ending credits! There were bits of mismatch between the subtitles and the voice-over but it's pretty minor that it didn't bother me that much nor did it affect playing the game at all.\n\nDarkestville Castle is definitely a great game.

Intial artwork looked quirky and fun. After playing through the game in its entirety I have a few issues with this game. \nFirst, artwork wise, the design of these characters just didn't go well with eachother. The only way I can describe it is that they were drawn by two different artists with different styles. It was as if some random kickstarters for the game entered their art and had it put in the game as a reward for supporting this games creation.  Cid, the protagonist is well design and clearly the most work went into his character. All other characters in this game however lacked any kind of personality and fell flat. \nSecond, the puzzles. In the beginning the puzzles were simple enough as expected to get the player used to the logic used in the game. However, towards the end I found myself clicking random things together just to get some kind of hint as to where to go next. Unless I completely missed something, one of the puzzles has you clicking on EVERYTHING just to find a hidden door. The other characters gave random and somewhat misleading information making me believe the puzzle was supposed to lead one direction, when it actually had nothing to do with solving the puzzle or future puzzles. \nThen the final puzzle, RIPPED RIGHT OUT OF MONKEY ISLAND. \nBasically the whole time I was playing this I felt like I was playing a subpar version of the Monkey Island games. There were so many directions this could have played out story wise that would have made me forgive the abysmal puzzles which where neither overly difficult except when random logic was required, or clever. I never felt rewarded or smart for solving these puzzles, more like \"ugh, finally...I can move on\". But no, the story end exactly how you expected and just like the narrator says in the begining \"dissappointing\". \n\nWhat the creators of this game can learn from this experience is, develop your characters more, supporting and protagonist. You can have the random npc's that give you a hint, but I expect at least a couple of character to have some kind of character development or something interesting about them in the least. Cid is only mildly interesting in the way that he's a \"badguy...Or is he?\"....trope. And as far as puzzles, don't make me pick up a bunch of random items and then hand them to people who ask for them. That's not puzzle solving, that's fetch questing. \n\nI think I'm only being super harsh on this because of two things. The initial reviews which intially got me interested and thinking this would be fun and the $15 price tag. \n\nIf you are still interested in this game, I HIGHLY suggest waiting for a drop in price/sale.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506228661, "timestamp_created": 1506228661, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 579, "steamid": "76561198114644499", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 58, "last_played": 1506227285, "playtime_forever": 579}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
