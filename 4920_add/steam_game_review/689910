So naturally we see a lot more work related stuff where the first game was all about school, clubs and becoming an adult.\n\nOnce again you have to go through someone's life to figure out all of their passwords. There are a few puzzles and a little bit of math, but they're only there to unlock certain things after you've read enough. If you're struggling with them, once again the developers have provided detailed guides in six languages that include spoiler free hints!\n\nMy favorite thing about both games is the fantastic soundtrack. The game itself is obviously pretty basic, but the music really creates a great atmosphere and the game is best enjoyed taking it all in and having the music on.\n\nThere's one thing that bothered me about the game and it's the failure of the mystery. I really don't wanna go into the story since it would spoil the experience, but if you're looking for a reveal you're not going to get one.\n\nOverall the game is just as enjoyable as the previous game, but the story really didn't intrigue me personally as much as the last one did. I think the age difference really changes the tone between the two games, but that's really not such a bad thing: it definitely doesn't feel like the same game all over again.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507144037, "timestamp_created": 1506994183, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "steamid": "76561198050975714", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 328, "last_played": 1506991954, "playtime_forever": 81}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35156746", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507610", "review": "I really like this kind of game.

Outside of the actual game, text is repetitive with no attention paid to grammar or punctuation. I think this does matter somewhat when you are settled into the pace required by a mostly text-based game but aside from the staccato feel this gives to the production of the game, it also gives little promise for the overall attention to detail employed by the developers.\n\nContrary to this, the character dialogue is far too \"polished\" and complete to realistically reflect the way people use text messages to communicate. I don't think consistency or accuracy in characterization received very much consideration during game creation. The messages more resemble the vernacular of a hobby game designer than a group of friends in the real world. \n\n The music is horribly tiresome and hellishly droning. It seems to be intended for people with an expired Mogadon prescription who need an alternative to get them through until the stores open on Monday morning. \n\n The interface of the game is every bit as much of a hindrance as a real mobile phone touchscreen which would be an achievement if this was marketed as a mobile phone simulator rather than a story based computer game, but it is not. \n\n Overall, playing \"Another Lost Phone: Laura's Story\" is rather like having someone tear all the pages from a novel before scattering them haphazardly around the room and then expecting to enjoy yourself while piecing them back together into the rather lackluster and uninspiring short story they comprised to begin with. \n\nThis is a game for mobile phone fetishists rather than people who enjoy computer games or those who simply want a compelling story which has been presented well.", "votes_down": 25, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506089641, "timestamp_created": 1506089641, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "steamid": "76561198029696244", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 60, "last_played": 1506088603, "playtime_forever": 41}, "votes_up": 11, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
