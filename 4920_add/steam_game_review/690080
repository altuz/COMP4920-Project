There are 3 worlds with 10 levels each, each level is one screen and filled with lasers, cannons, saws, spikes, and other various things that kill you.  Controls are simple and very responsive, you can move left and right and jump/double jump.  Your character moves at the perfect speed, fast enough to be able to get through the traps, but not so fast that he is difficult to control.  In order for a game like this to work the control has to be absolutely perfect, and it is, you will die a ton in this game but it is never the fault of the control.\n\nLevel design is good, you can see everything as soon as the level begins.  There are no cheap deaths in this game, every trap is clearly visible and you know exactly what to expect as you progress through the various stages.  This game is difficult, but there is no annoying trial and error stuff here, in theory you can beat every level on the first attempt, in practice that will never happen.  \n\nYou can start the game from any world, all 3 worlds are playable from the get go so it gives you some freedom in how you tackle the levels, the downside of this is that the difficulty curve is basically non-existent.  The game starts out tough and staysthe same level of tough throughout the entire game.  I also don't know if this is just me, or my skills increasing, but I felt like I died hundreds of times in world 2 and barely died in world 3.  On world 2 I was averaging 30-50 deaths per level, in world 3 I died less than 10 times per level.  \n\nThe only annoyance of the game is that the traps don't reset on each death, which leads to a few annoying spots where you need to wait for the right conditions to progress, it is not terrible, but when you are on your 30th death on a level and feeling frustrated it throws off your progress and adds an extra layer of frustration to the level.  \n\nBottom line is this game is a dollar and for that price you get an excellent platformer, with tight controls, and great level design.  If you are into these types of games that buying this should be a no brainer.  The game will make you rage for all the right reasons and is a very satisfying experience, that took me about 2 hours to finish but your mileage may vary based on your skill in these kinds of games.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504548723, "timestamp_created": 1504548723, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198116707297", "num_reviews": 29, "num_games_owned": 1298, "last_played": 1504547399, "playtime_forever": 125}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
