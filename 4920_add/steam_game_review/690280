As a little bit of background, my name is Kyle - I'm 32 years old and I suffer from Asperger syndrome.\n\n[h1]What this game does well[/h1]\n\nThe game can help you create some beautiful ASMR fantasies. Suffering from Aspergers, I find it hard sometimes to express myself and feel unique. I bought this software not expecting much and I left feeling amazed.\n\nThe sounds are beautiful, they are very hot and good quality. They sound [h1]super nice[/h1] on my custom headset I built.\n\nI love the nice sounds that gently enter your ears, they leave a satisfying tingle and make me feel warm.\n\nThis software is truly a masterpiece and I recommend you buy it right now. Not only is it cheap - but it will provide an amazing asmr [strike]masturbation[/strike] session.\n\nThank you developer, I hope to hear some more crisp sounds soon :smiley:", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504906451, "timestamp_created": 1504906451, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198364491438", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 45, "last_played": 1504906441, "playtime_forever": 5}, "votes_up": 18, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34949611", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514275", "review": "bad quality random sounds, most of those are recorded with annoying background noise,\nmost of the sound samples are not relaxing at all, annoying cheap circus sounds.\n\nA lot of good quality binaural field audio are on the youtube. it is nowhere from that.\nThose guys make investments of high quality binaural microphones.\nASMR Universe is a cheap piece of junk, drag and drop and click events with cheap stock sounds.\n", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505399563, "timestamp_created": 1505399563, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044964432", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 61, "last_played": 1505331138, "playtime_forever": 29}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34864652", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495834", "review": "ASMR is quite weird. But brilliant at the same time.\nA great little app to get started exploring AMSR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response).\n\nUsing this and listening to the loops as you add sounds and move them around te \"sound universe\"is like rebooting your mind. Particularly with headphones. And it comes with 7.1 support.\nA few minutes toying with this and I'm all chilled out and my three dogs have wandered into the room and gone to sleep.\n\nI'm a pretty \"stressy\" grumpy sort of old git, and this fixed it. Amazing what effect sounds can have on the mind.\n\nHandy for making sound effects and background sound loops for your games too, you can record output as a WAV file simply by pressing 'R'.\n\nThe Dev has made this with unity,and it has a nice feel to it, almost everything is very intuitive.\nThere is no manual as such, but a useful help tab in the edit screen which covers everything you need to know in a brief clear way.\n\nYou can save your \"sound universes\" to the steam workshop, save them on your pc, or record them as audio tracks. In addition you can import sounds, loops or beats in several audio formats, inclusding OGG into a custom sound library accessed under a separate tab.  (You can't share universes with imported custom sounds to the workshop for legal reasons).", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505323226, "timestamp_created": 1505057500, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970350988", "num_reviews": 105, "num_games_owned": 138, "last_played": 1505571224, "playtime_forever": 173}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34875023", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496627", "review": "Awesome  Game  Its funny and weird ..
