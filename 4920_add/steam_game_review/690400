The story is all visual, so there are NO narrators OR words used in this lovely visual story. The little blue butterfly is your guide, so you cant really go wrong, she will stay close to you as you progress & guide you. [/i]\n\n[i]The Game only has 3 levels that you can go back to once unlocked at any given time, & all with very pretty effects you will see as you progress through. I personally wish the game was much longer, because I want to see more! I feel developer could  always add a few more levels which depict the rainbow colours as what was intended. So game needs a yellow and blue level added I feel. Maybe developers will think and add something a little later once developed, so we shall see what happens if they even read these reviews! [/i]\n\n[i] The game also plays great with the Xbox controller OR you can choose to use keyboard & mouse, the choice is yours. [/i]\n\n[i]The music is a pleasure to listen to while progressing though as well.[/i]\n\n[i] I feel the price is very fair for what your getting & what you will see with in this very pretty game, is does [b]NOT[/b] disapoint. This game is a very sweet hidden gem, amongst all those asset flippers I call junk. This game is certainly [b]NOT[/b] junk ok[/i]\n\n[b] Game does need a few steam achievements added at some point in time, and perhaps some lovely trading cards. I can see some lovely badges, emoticons and backgrounds could come from this game easily in the future, thats if these developers are listening & reading ;D .[/b]\n\n[b]Game length is around 60 minutes, I played for longer. So time should never matter, if you choose to play though mutiple times at your own pace and leisure.[/b]", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506641679, "timestamp_created": 1506641337, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 109, "steamid": "76561198079335824", "num_reviews": 98, "num_games_owned": 4216, "last_played": 1506609312, "playtime_forever": 109}, "votes_up": 24, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35261147", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447464", "review": "Lovely platformer/adventure game, beautiful & relaxing.
