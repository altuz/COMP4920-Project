Oddly enough I enjoyed the educational part of the game and found it to at least be a unique way to make a spam achievement game.  Of course as an adult I didnt take as much from the game from an educational stand point, but if you have young children, this could be something they'd enjoy.  Plus, if you have them play it, they'll unlock the achievements for you.  haha\n\nAt this time I am still having some trouble unlocking all the achievements, it appears as though you have to randomly click objects on the screen, sometimes multiple times, in order to get them to unlock.\n\n*EDIT*  Restarting the game and replaying Book 6 of the New Levels (bottom row, second from left) unlocked many achievements.  Also, I was missing a few other achievements and this is how I found them.  \"Open the book LION and click on the crown, and book DEER and click on the spinner.\"\n\nSo basically, if you open a book and see something that shouldnt be there, click on it.  Same goes for all the other objects located on the screen and hidden on the walls.\n\nAnyways, the game ran okay and although it doesn't have any setting options other than \"quality\", you can use alt+enter to go into a windowed mode.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504964800, "timestamp_created": 1504886592, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198121017576", "num_reviews": 214, "num_games_owned": 2169, "last_played": 1504888115, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
