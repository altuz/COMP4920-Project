And most of the time, when you are given choice it is usually, in reality, just an illusion of choice. Especially in terms of narrative, because it means tons of \"extra work\" for the developers. Very few games truly give you choice, and when they do it's either trivial or very few in number. And I mean choice for both in terms of how you shape the story and how you approach the gameplay. Deus Ex however, despite being a 17 year old game in the time that I'm writing this,(The game is probably older than most people reading this I would guess.) does both of those things in a kind of perfection that hasn't been achieved since, and may even never be truly achieved in the future.\n\nLet me explain the gameplay part: Getting from point A to point B in Deus Ex is an endless realm of possibilities. Not just because of your choice in skill and augmentation upgrades, or items and weapon upgrades. Sure they do help but if you're skilled enough as a player you can pull off a lot of things even if you're not equipped for it. This means, at any given time, there are endless amounts of ways a level in Deus Ex can be beaten. All you have to do is accomplish the objective, one way or the other. In fact, there are many levels where you DON'T have to accomplish the objective at all either! Now that, is choice. You can beat the game even if you don't augment your body at all. You can beat the game without picking up or using a single item or weapon. You can beat the game by just massacring everyone. You can just run away from the boss fights. Running from god damn boss fights, how many video games do you know that allow that? I only know one: Deus Ex, and I have played tons and tons of video games. I still haven't seen another video game where you can say \"f*ck you\" to the objective menu and do whatever the hell you please with the game, and have it still be connected to a comprehensive, well written story!\n\nThe story. Don't worry, I won't spoil anything at all. Everything about it, the characters, the world, the dialogue are all expertly put together. I have not played another game where I am this excited when I'm about to have a conversation with someone. Every single bit of dialogue in this game is great. and before you mention them, yes, ESPECIALLY the JC Denton One-Liners. JC Denton is one of the most entertaining video game characters of all time. Anyways, in terms of the story one thing is for certain, there won't be another video game that handles conspiracies this ballsy and \"in your face\" kind of way ever again. There is no other game in history that handles the Illuminati and secret government this seriously, openly and realistically. Deus Ex is, and it seems it will definitely stay as, one of a kind in terms of this. The plot constantly drives you further and further, you feel like you HAVE to know more about the story, you have to know what happens. It's like the video game equivalent of a page-turner book, that's how good the story is. And as I said above, you are always given plenty of choices on how to shape the story, and they are REAL choices unlike most games, but I won't spoil them. Let's also not forget to mention: The soundtrack is simply amazing. There are very few video games like this where you can honestly say there is not a single \"meh\" track in it. Every single bit of music in this game is awesome.\n\nRole Playing Games are about choice, shaping your own character and dropping into a world and being immersed by it. Living in that world and shaping it as you see fit. And if Deus Ex isn't the prime example of that I don't know what the hell is. Prior to playing it I have mostly heard people calling it \"The best PC game of all time\", \"The best RPG of all time\" and \"The best video game of all time\", and they have a god damn good reason for saying all this. And I agree that this game is definitely the best RPG of all time, simply because of how much choice it gives you and how good the story and the dialogue is.\n\nI still, to this day can't believe the fact that this game was made in the year 2000."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506059973, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516092", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "35121249", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033407837", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1506371414, "num_games_owned": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "playtime_forever": 6167}, "timestamp_updated": 1506059973, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The elite are all about transcendence and living forever and the secrets of the universe and they want to know all this, some are good some are bad some are a mix; but the good ones don't ever want to organize, the bad ones tend to want to organize because they lust after power.

I originally had this game through a friend's GOG account, but when i saw it on sale I was about half way through so I decided to buy it and transfer my save. I played this game for the first time 17 years after its release, but it felt much more recent, minus the graphics. The combat did seem tedious, slow and limited at first but upon gaining experience and upgrades it became very in-depth. This game was truly ahead of it's time, it provided meaningful choices, non-linear levels, superb level design, great voice acting, in-depth character customization, great writing/world creation, a soundtrack that aged well, and an expansive lore filled world. It basically has everything most modern games should but don't, making it a true must have/play for every sci-fi and rpg fan.\n\n\nStory/Writing: 10/10 - Every choice felt meaningful, i.e. Stealth/confict, going the extra mile for the mission, data  gathering etc.  The writing was very well done, VERY rarely did a dialogue or remark seem out of character or half-assed  . The main character, Denton, has a great voice actor who nails every single scene and one-liner. But the npcs are also all very entertaining, from the first kid clearly voiced by an adult to every single npc in Honk Kong, Paris and more. The amount of dialogue is astonishing for a game this  old, after having started my second playthrough I tried to find more dialogue and I noticed that I missed half of the game's dialoge by not trying to talk to people after a conversation, it practically doubled.\n\nMusic/Sound:10/10  - From the memorable main theme to random conflicts in a sewer the soundtrack carried its own  weight. The soundtrack itself makes a lot of the moments throughout the game, being electronic it fits  the game perfectly. The stealth system benefits extremely from the superb sound system in this game, making listening for foot steps or machine systems essential. Gun sounds are little lacking but that isn't a huge deal when stealth is more difficult and more fun.\n\nCombat/Stealth:9/10 - The only reason i give it a 9 is because it is dated and got annoying a few times. Don't expect Mass Effect level action, especially in the first hour, but the intensity picks up very quickly. Sadly the first half  hour to hour doesn't give a great picture of gameplay throughout and may convince some to stop  playing. Some weapons are super overpowered  making stealth  seem meaningless on lower  difficulties, but opting for stealth gameplay and weaponry is very rewarding. The stealth system in  this game cleary revolutionized the genre, absolutely perfecting the balance between sound and visibility(light), making it a staple for all stealth games.\n\nGraphics/World:10/10 - Obviously it's 17 years old, but once you get past some of the character's faces the graphics are actually quite good and fit the game well. The areas are quite compact so there aren't many big  cityscapes or landscapes but the style of each area and npc is onpoint and really immersive. Some of the voice acting is rather poor, but for me that adds charm.\n\nGameplay: 10/10  - The controls were rather overwhelming and dificult at first, but after remapping to match a modern shooter, for example making flashlight \"F\", using mouse buttons, or moving   augs to other keys,  the game felt quite smooth. The character customization is rather in-depth for  it's time, offering a skill system and an augmentation system that allowed a choice of 2 augs in 11 slots along with levels themselves.\n\nReplayability: 10/10  - Having just started my second playthrough I noticed that I missed a ridiculous amount of dialogue and mission options. I think it could be played through 3 or more times with new things presenting themselves. Every time I sneak into a base I accidenty sneak out a few times due to the amount of entrances."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505419558, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502307", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34956548", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972193795", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1476348402, "num_games_owned": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15}, "timestamp_updated": 1505419558, "received_for_free": false, "review": "There is a saying that as soon as someone mentions Deus Ex or posts a picture online someone will yet again install it and play it through once again.\n\nThe game that does almost everything right.
