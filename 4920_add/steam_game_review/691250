The goal of the game is simple, progress through 3 Worlds, each make up of 3 stages and an additional boss stage.\n\nMovement is simply left and right, with a jump. Some of the water that Charlie can swim on are portals to hidden areas - pressing down will take you to an addition zone on the stage so you can collect additional coins and diamonds. It is prudent to check all the water parts as I found some stages include multiple hidden zones.\n\nYou can play with keyboard or controller - but I found that sometimes while using the thumb stick to move on my xbox controller that Charlie would just keep walking in the direction I was pressing, even after releasing it. All I could do is put him up against an obstacle in the game and wait for it to stop. I have not had this problem with other games, so I do not believe it is an issue with my setup. Using the D-Pad on the controller to move seemed to avoid this problem.\n\nI thought sound effects were fine, as was the music. The graphics are a 16 bit style, and the background is layered to give visual depth.\n\nGameplay wise, its an adequate platformer which (at my skill level) I found challenging enough. Thankfully when I died I could continue from the start of the world stage I reached. This was appreciated as I died A LOT on the 1st boss. But it does take away from the replayability of the game, I don't see myself playing it again after I have completed it.\n\nI was torn on recommending this game. Gameplay wise its fine, but I feel the price at release is too high given the amount of content in the game. It took me a bit over 30 minutes to complete the 1st world. If that continues for the other 2, then I will be finished in an hour and a half. For $6.99, that is a limited amount of play considering I don't feel there is much replayability. If you are interested, I recommend waiting for a sale before picking it up, at a cheaper price I would recommending if platformers is your preferred game. \n\nIf you do decide to buy this game, just a tip for fighting the first boss (the fish). You need to jump on his eyes, closer to front of his body instead nearer to the spikes on his back to score a hit.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506173152, "timestamp_created": 1506172113, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "steamid": "76561197960286303", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "last_played": 1506168640, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
