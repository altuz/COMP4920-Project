At first glance you'd probably be thinking this is a copy of a casual sandbox world, but this game is much better than it sounds. The game runs smoothly and I haven't found any major bugs in my time playing. And you won't need a really good top notch pc to play this either. I believe this game has started off to be great and once this game gets out of Early Access it'll be twice as good and will only get better. And I love the visuals. The fire, weather, and just the visuals in general look amazing. Props to the people who made this. I'll continue playing this for a long time and I think Alchemage has a great potential to be one of Steam's Best. Thanks for reading this and I hope you found this a good \"before you buy\" review. I definetely recommend this addicting game.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505624293, "timestamp_created": 1505624185, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198155141384", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 11, "last_played": 1505945911, "playtime_forever": 263}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35093208", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501481", "review": "Is great fun! alot like terraria but controls alot better, and visually looks better! will be playing it alot more!\n\nIts on sale right now so its worth getting!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505946883, "timestamp_created": 1505946883, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198089366332", "num_reviews": 38, "num_games_owned": 296, "last_played": 1505954434, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34999999", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483948", "review": "A tombstone will be generated on the location where you DIE, which contains all the items from your inventory.\nGo back to where you died and dig your own tomb to get you items back.\n\n\u6b7b\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5893\u7891, \u4f60\u7684\u80cc\u5305\u91cc\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u90fd\u5728\u90a3\u4e2a\u575f\u5893\u91cc\u9762, \u5f97\u56de\u53bb\u6316\u575f", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505576052, "timestamp_created": 1505576052, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "steamid": "76561197999970174", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 39, "last_played": 1506771018, "playtime_forever": 191}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34988705", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482197", "review": "Game reminds me of Starbound and the game play is almost spot on to how startbound is played.

There's Magic, Monsters and lots of Exploration. Building, Crafting goodness!
