I don't demo to many people but I can imagine this is great to demo VR as it's quick to learn and entertaining to watch others play.\n\nFeedback:\n\nWhile the music is fine, I feel a more comedic and light hearted theme would be more suitable. Maybe have a few different choices to choose from (visions of Outrun and selecting your tune on the radio before you start spring to mind).\n\nMaybe better audio feedback for headshots would be good - when it gets intense you don't want to be unsure if you one-hit a bird or not.\n\nFor us taller and older folk, bending down all the time to make your snowballs, pick up the fish etc can wear a bit on your back. \n\n\nIt's a polished, simple and fun game, and I recommend it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504266284, "timestamp_created": 1504266284, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970449027", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 114, "last_played": 1504991813, "playtime_forever": 56}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
