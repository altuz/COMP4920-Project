Complete missions, get new weapons and gear, repeat until finish. It had a lot of charm to it. Sadly Stellatum lacks most of that charm. \n\nBy all means it's not a bad game. I've played much worse in all respects. It visually looks appealing and has gameplay that's fun from time to time but the moment you step out of the tutorial you're stuck with pretty lackluster weapons that take quite a while to kill things, especially bosses. It's like you're given a entire toolbox for 5 seconds then you're stuck with a spanner right after. The pace of the game just crashes to a halt because of it.\n\nThe stages are also rather unvaried with your choice of space, space or more space. Sometimes the game throws in asteroids or small space stations of sorts but it's just dull to look at. At least the enemy ships are decent but they are not very threatening. I mean they shoot alot of bullets but they are slow, you can shoot them down, you have abilities that destroy large amounts of them and you have crap tons of room to move about to avoid them. They also don't come in any formation that poses a threat to your movement.\n\nI like being able to customize my ship with parts although all the blueprints are locked behind missions and they are trickled fed to you after a while which kills the majority of the game's diversity because they are generally just better than the previous part. A few more variants of parts near the start would had done wonders i feel.\n\nIn summary, the game moves too slow for people who like these kind of games and will quickly get bored. 6/10.\n\nPS: Devs, why are you asking people to recommend your game after completing mission 5? That's a nasty mobile phone app tactic to get good ratings. Are you trying to hide something from the players further in?\n", "votes_down": 23, "language": "english", "comment_count": "8", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505551580, "timestamp_created": 1505551580, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993869948", "num_reviews": 57, "num_games_owned": 444, "last_played": 1505715618, "playtime_forever": 109}, "votes_up": 63, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35007460", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517004", "review": "Has potential to be a good game, but it feels like someone started making a game and then just stopped working on it half way through.", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505596675, "timestamp_created": 1505596675, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198044588822", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 201, "last_played": 1505693528, "playtime_forever": 218}, "votes_up": 16, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35047584", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505530", "review": "yes, there a lot of space shooter games in steam, but this one is especial, and i will do my best to explain why.\n\n[h1] graphics is beautiful[/h1]\nyes, first of all its very beautiful. backgrounds you play on deserve to be a wallpaper on your computer or mobile;\nyour ship is modular and consists of thought over parts, enemies health is shown in clear but minimal dots - everything from user interface to the last pixel you see is designed properly and thouroughly.\n\n[h1] it offers more[/h1]\nusually in a game of space fighting genre all you can get is battleground: in this game you are getting a hangar where you do upgrades, animations that tell a story, different locations, overall progress map, and even a tutorial!\nnext, its written game has whole 80 different levels, though i am not sure you might really need whole 80 )))\n\n\n[h1]gameplay[/h1]\nspeaking honestly, i've stuck on mission 4, but i may have played too lazily :)) first thing i want to admit this game offers you more playing space then most competitors, on one hand it gives you more space for maneuvers, but on the other hand it gives you more enemies: both stationary cannons, and moving enemy spaceships, asteroids that steal your maneuver space - all these things make a game addictive!\n\n\n[h1]conclusion[/h1]\nstellatum sets a new standarts for scroller shooter games genre, so all the games that share the concept may be devided into before Stellatum and after. \n\n\n[h1]pros[/h1]\ngraphics\nconstruction possibilities\nlots of addictions to the gameplay (story, animations, hangar)\n\n\n[h1]cons[/h1]\nstellatum font? \nnot too easy to play? though i am not sure whether its a game's drawback\n\ni think i will update the review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505748886, "timestamp_created": 1505748886, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198110829497", "num_reviews": 240, "num_games_owned": 2596, "last_played": 1505748942, "playtime_forever": 142}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35043894", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Wow!
