PC titles tended to be more complex, have a ton of hotkeys that just couldn't be fit onto a controller, and were larger in just about every way owing to the same factors that make PC's technologically superior to consoles to this day. More RAM, more HD space, better graphical capabilities, etc etc etc. \n\nWell into the 2000's this reality was still prevalent, and no game better encapsulates this contrast and mentality turned reality than Deus Ex: Invisible War-a title made with consoles in mind first and foremost.\n\nWhereas Deus Ex had massive maps that are still respectable to this day. Invisible War entraps you in confined rooms and locales seperated by doorways and gates that lead to loading times. Necessary as the XBox hardware wouldn't allow massive areas. Invisible War attempts to create the illusion of being outside when not in a building, but you might as well be since everything is still corridors and rather tight spaces. The only difference is that there is now a skybox (sometimes) when 'outside', but that skybox is hidden by conveniently large buildings that make the difference between being outdoors and indoors a question of how high the ceiling is and if the ceiling is a solid ceiling or a skybox.\n\nI can't fault this too much as it *is* a game of its time, but it's worth noting since Deus Ex 1 didn't suffer these limitations and it's 5 years older than this title at the point of release. It's taking a step back. To its defense its not a massive deal or anything that would deter the creation of just as engaging a game as the first.\n\nBut that's where this title fails again. \n\nContinuing its console syndrome, this game eliminates a vital aspect of the first game: the RPG elements. You don't receive differing damage on your various appendages. You don't have as robust or intriguing an upgrade system to your biomodifications. Gone are the various abilities you could level up from the previous game (proficiency in weapons, heavy weapons, computers, etc). There are no more computers where you can read characters' emails that build the lore and world. You don't hack anymore, you don't talk to as many NPC's and engage in the various side quests that have you building lore and the world. I do not understand why they engaged the subtraction game in aspects that made the first title unique. That was basically all of Deus Ex there.\n\nIf they focused on the gunplay and enhanced it, that would be fine, but it's the same as before. Meaning, below average, only now all weapons share the same ammo pool which is just confusing. There is no reason to carry anything past a sniper rifle and perhaps an SMG or shotgun since all weapons have the same ammo pool. It completely defeats the purpose of carrying variety, its just....I don't understand it. I'll have to google the logic behind that.\n\nWhat of the story and side missions? Well, just as with everything else this area has also been downsized....severely. God has it been downsized. As stated, the sidequests and various characters to talk to are gone for the most part. There just isn't as much there, and what is there is typically rather linear. Wheras in Deus Ex you would engage in quests and be able to maneuver the ordeal and side with parties, here you just get quests and do them. Very few of them require siding with any party. It's just quests to do. There are no repricussions, or rewards for that matter.\n\nSurprisingly, the story isn't *that* bad. Deus Ex had three endings, and here we have a sort of mixture of all three. It actually makes sense, and is rather basic. So basic that I can't really poke too many holes in it, only to say that for a franchise of this caliber this is really....tiny. Deus Ex built on the underlying concepts of the plot through character conversations, books, and logs. You'd delve into the nature of Democracy, Governance, and Free Will which underlied a game about massive institutions lead by a few governing the many. It was a philisophical work.\n\nInvisible War, on the other hand, gives you character dialogue and....that's it. Rather short discussions with no explenation or delving into the underlying concepts. It's rather sad; when they got rid of the RPG elements they *really* did a disservice to the plot. It's as if they had a general outline for the plot....and shipped the game out like that. \n\nAnd the plot is alright. Some character motives and elements are just left at simple, \"it is what it is\" explanations. *Slight spoiler warning* the Illuminati is involved once more, and when told that they control factions, including oppositional factions, not much is said as to how contradictory and braindead that is other than, \"yeah, its weird right? You gotta build and control\" or some other such nonsense. It's a GLARING PLOTHOLE THAT REQUIRED A LOT MORE EXPLENATION\n\nA LOT MORE.\n\nBut you know, for convenience sake and to have you follow a linear route lets just say the factions were one in the same. It's such a cop out.\n\nSpeaking of which, its difficult to take this game seriously when you can kill faction leaders and...just really disgrace a faction but the ability to still partner with it is available and they merely chastise you over the radio for not following orders. \"Well, anyway, please do follow this next order....\"\n\nI understand its so that the player can still make his choice in endings, and its much appreaciated. At the same time, it deligitimizes your plot points; you can allow options in endings without disrespecting your world and characters within it. \n\nAll in all I'd say its rather mediocre. Wiki the plot or something; its actually decent even if barebones. It follows logically from the first title and makes some familiar faces into villains if you view their actions as villanous...which you totally can. Otherwise, as its own title it really is bad. Only the most dedicated of Deus Ex fans will play it, and only for the plot...and this is assuming they don't just retcon the hell out of this."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506152609, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506329", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35146652", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": "6", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053855195", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1469795134, "num_games_owned": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 62}, "timestamp_updated": 1506772802, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Uh. I want to like this game so much. Dues Ex and Halo are my 2 favorite franchies of all time. I beat the first Dues Ex countless times. I beat Human Revolution on ps3, 360, then PC. I have 100+ hours in Mankind Divided, beat the game in perma death mode, masetered Breach mode, crushed all the crappy short DLC. I beat the silly mobile game, The Fall, managed to shove 6 hours into a 2 hour game. Read the Dues Ex books. I LOVE Dues Ex, and I just can't play this game. Its bad, its not Duex Ex. Its a console game in the worst way when console games and PC games stood miles apart and the limitations that seperated them were as wide as the Grand Canyon.\n\nEdit: and I would like to add that I played this game through back on consoles so 1 hour is not indictive of my entire Invisble War experience."}]}
