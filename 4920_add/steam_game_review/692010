She also needs breast physics (looks odd them so rigid solid as she dances). If you are willing for the limited characters (only 1). And limited environments (also only 1) this is very nice. I would also like some way to interact with the game. Like a rhythm game or cheering to unlock a special extra dance. Things like that. Still at $6 dollars I like it.
