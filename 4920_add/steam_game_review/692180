While graphics and gameplay are fairly bad and simple it still makes for not a half bad game to kill the time while also adding in some challenging and difficult (both good and bad) levels to beat. The levels seem to go in a bit of an odd order, you will get some harder ones that will take you a few shots in doing it and then the one after its very very simple (but this may have been the way the developer intended). \n\nExample being Level 1 I was confused as hell yet Level 2 I flew through straight to Level 3 in an instant. Overall there is room for improvement, some levels are broken so I've read from the Dev themselves. I hope some settings come into play into further updates. I got this for $0.10 USD so I cannot really hate on the game itself and it being $0.99 USD you don't go in expecting a game that will change the way you see games. I have gotten a few laughs and certainly a fair amount of what the fuck how are these possible moments.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505632211, "timestamp_created": 1505632211, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198019487666", "num_reviews": 64, "num_games_owned": 515, "last_played": 1505809835, "playtime_forever": 44}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35065018", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "This game is a Pile of Trashbags, lives up to it's name in every way and for that, it deserves a recommendation!\n\nI played the game here too if you wanna see how perfectly bad it is!\nhttps://youtu.be/OmUwgEMACfw", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505829725, "timestamp_created": 1505829725, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198365859160", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 11, "last_played": 1505805220, "playtime_forever": 18}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34788310", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499810", "review": "No instructions, controls, or settings.
