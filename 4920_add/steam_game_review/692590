With the survival mode being 'coming soon' I would say it's not worth the full price yet. \n\nI'd like to start off the actual review by saying this game is bad. It's awful, to start the game I had a 2 minute loading screen and that might be an understatement. after the tutorial I got another loading screen where a voice said inpact after 30 seconds. ~2 minutes later I got the loading screen to the next level. This game is filled with stupid bugs that the devs should have found by playtesting. For instance I fell through a platform that was supposed to open and release a type of enemy. There's an inventory for only 1 item and the menu is buggy like crazy. Area's are very dark to the point where I once fell off the platform because I couldn't see the floor. combat is easily broken by just slowing down time permanently and walking through the level without enemies being able to even hit you. In the final level it wasn't clear at all where I was supposed to go until I accidentally found it. \n\nenough complaining about the game, I've given it a positive review so might aswell state why it's still fun rather than just bashing on and on about the problems it has.\n\nDuring the tutorial I got bored and just ran through because with the limited controls the game has there was very little need for an actual tutorial. though I was running through the game said out loud what I was supposed to do so I still picked up on the mechanics.\nIf you don't abuse the slowdown the gameplay gets rather interesting. It's punishing but at the same time very easy to pick up. I'd say limit the slowdown of time to some counter that has to re-charge once used. \nthe levels were quite well designed. Though it wasn't very clear where to go, I managed to find everything. Maybe add a minimap for directions or see if the brightness alone will fix this problem. \n\nAs I'm turning this into a tell the dev what could be done better I'll write down the rest of the things I've got on my mind aswell.\n\nA strong point of the game was the unforgiving gameplay. At points I got shot and died instantly. Rather than being upset I liked it, it meant I was being careless and I learned from my mistakes. I'd say use this to the game's advantage and make the game difficult. 1 shot maybe 2 shots to not make the medkids useless. talking about the medkids, as it's the only item in the game and the inventory being so buggy, why not make the Q-key a medkit hotkey, there's space on the HUD for a medkit counter aswell as the slow down time bar. \nthe space level was AMAZING I had a lot of fun just flying around but I wish there was more control in the air. Flying around felt very limited, though this is realistic, you're a robot in space... might aswell cut some realism for some fun. Also make the jump less high, it kinda broke the entire first part of the level by just pressing shift twice. \nI also noticed in that level when you respawn, you respawn in the air. Probably to not get stuck in the floor but once I respawned it took a few seconds before I landed because of the gravity. \nAnother thing I noticed is that the orb enemies only showed up once. they came up through the platform which I fell through. \n\nDamn that was a lot of typing... Hopefully that was helpful and dev if you need more playtesting done, just hit me up.
