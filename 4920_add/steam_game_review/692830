He has also made a walkthrough video for the game. At least he shows willing to improve his game so this is to be commended. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HD5uIcc1J2Q\n\nBasically this game is an ugly mess.  So the graphics, are for the most part subpar, with some extremely ugly environmentals and weird glowing yellow objects all over the place. The controls are also somewhat confusing. Right click to activate your lamp, and using T and Y to turn your cursor on and off?\n\nAlso you lamp only illuminates a small area around you, you might as well leave it off for all the differance it makes. \n\nBut most broken seems to be the AI - no matter what I tried the werewolf would instakill me. Each and every time. In fact I never made it out of the starting area, so never did see any of the lore that was promised. \n\nThe only positive was the interesting opening cutscene and inoffensive audio. \n\nTLDR - even if this game is only 80pence there are better free horror games on steam. I rarely refund for such a low cost game, but this time I think I might take steam up on the offer.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505490371, "timestamp_created": 1505230092, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "steamid": "76561197989290281", "num_reviews": 108, "num_games_owned": 1203, "last_played": 1506442613, "playtime_forever": 185}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35317133", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Nice creepy outdoor atmosphere.\nBut i can't get out the first area because an \"invisible\" monster always instantly hits me.\nDidn't try further what i'm supposed to do.
