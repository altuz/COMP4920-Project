The upgrade system in particular is very well done, rewarding you for achieving bonus objectives and the skills changing the way you play as you unlock them. The story is nice but some times the good ideas are a bit held back by a somewhat poor delivery. Gameplay wise while there is some cases of annoyance due to \"unlucky\" inavoidable damage (but the game seems to be built with that in mind), the fatastic boss fights were definitly worth it as for some of them I was feeling like I was fighting a boss in a souls game.\n\nAll and all Star Waker is a enjoyable shooter with replayability through bonus levels and the two difficulty levels, while not the perfect game ( but is it even possible ) if you like shooting things in space it's definitly worth getting.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1503899485, "timestamp_created": 1503899485, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "steamid": "76561198074275189", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 125, "last_played": 1506242278, "playtime_forever": 947}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34720891", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496739", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1504603437, "review": "The early levels are quite fun and I like how you gain skill points by completing objectives.
