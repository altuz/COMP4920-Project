You know, since the only description of the game is a single question and I had to guess what the game is. Based on the fact that the first patchnotes mentioned hunger, I assumed it was a survival game.\n\nSurprise! It's not a survival game! It's a platformer. A diffiicult one at that. Movements are slow, there's no way to run and \"safe\" rocks became dead ends very quickly as they sunk into the lava. \n\n5 deaths trying to get to the first \"checkpoint\" and another 3 trying to get past that checkpoint. I'm done. No thanks. I don't like games with zero sense of progress. Just bash your head against the wall and hope you win! Not my idea of fun, but maybe someone else likes this style of game?", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504723218, "timestamp_created": 1504723218, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198006363388", "num_reviews": 33, "num_games_owned": 349, "last_played": 1504722909, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34993613", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495274", "review": "It's good i like it a lot but boy does it test every bit of patience you have", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505558700, "timestamp_created": 1505558700, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "steamid": "76561198325953184", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 10, "last_played": 1506856566, "playtime_forever": 115}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
