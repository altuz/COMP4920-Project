My original review WILL stay up for this game originally made with the Game Guru software.  My video review gave the game a ZERO score basically, and I stated it wasn't even worth the time it took to play it, much less his original asking price of $14.99 USD.  \n\nSince then on the comments of my videos about his game on my YT channel, the developer took down his game from being able to be purchased, and has promised to re-make the game with new assets and a new game engine IF i removed my video reviews about his game.  \n\nI complied with his request in hopes that we will see this indie developer grow from this and make his game better in a new engine.  \n\n--- (Original Review on September 25th, 2017) ----\n\n\nTruly an epic masterpiece of a game.  The developer held back no expense to make this amazing game spending all of $19.99 for the best game engine money can buy with Game Guru!  And the map design left me just speechless.  I mean just think of how much time and effort it takes to grab flat grass terrain and hold the left mouse button and drag it up, then to do that again 12 or 13 more times to make the amazing \"hills\" found in this game.  Some AAA developers go to school for many, many years and don't possess such incredible skills.\n\nThe deep story in the game is what is what should win this developer major awards however.  The story of \"Zombies Berserk\" puts all previous stories like those of Silent Hill 2, Metal Gear Solid 5, Mass Effect 2, That Dragon Cancer, and Bioshock to shame.  I cried.  I laughed.  I felt emotions never before felt (anger and laughter) to the degree I felt while playing this sure to win mass awards game.\n\nThe AI and challenge found in games like Dark Souls pales in comparison to that found in \"Zombies Berserk\".  These zombies will spend five minutes acting like they can't fit through a doorway only to watch you turn your back on them to try and sneak up behind you!  Just incredible!  \n\nThis compelling game left me desperate for more.  I now no longer appreciate my real life, my real flesh and blood kids or even real food.  All I desire and need is more zombies and i pray that we get endless sequels to this masterpiece of a game.  I can't believe this developer only asks $14.99 USD for this, and it takes all of 42 minutes to beat on the first play, stopping of course to admire the amazing scenery, super meticulous attention to every detail of each map.  Truly map design work that will leave you in sheer awe and endless wonder.\n\nOkay, okay...  enough sarcasm.\n\n42 minutes to beat my first time playing it.  The irony is the developer states in his early access details that he wants this game to have over 50 levels and be the \"best\" zombie game evwer made.  Cough, Cough, Cough!  - As expected, this game was made with the worst game engine imaginable (Game Guru), uses maps and mobs layouts that look like a 4 year child designed them, and is as utterly silly and effortless as any other Game Guru trash game found on Steam.  To ask $14.99 for this deserves nothing less than karma to put the developer waking up in a real life eternity, forever forced to walk the maps and face the horrid assets used in this heinous mess of a game.\n\nMy Score:  This game doesn't even deserve my time calculating a score in the negatives, because a ZERO would be far too good for this.  Imagine someone coming to offer to mow your lawn and charging you $15, then leaving your grass itself untouched but mowing down your garden and flower bed you've spent months working on.  Oh, and leaving vomit, empty beer cans, and human feces all over your lawn for that price.  ..That would be the real life comparison to the developer trying to charge $15 for this absolute nightmare of a no effort game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RZdE_i7Aao&feature=youtu.be\n\n..Not recommended.  This is easily one of the worst games on Steam.  I know there is some vile crap here on Steam, but this is right there at the top of the pile of vile crap, trust me.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506592350, "timestamp_created": 1506381050, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "last_played": 1506379140, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
