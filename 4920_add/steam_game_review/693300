The game is built on a concept that's surely existed before, but is taken to the minimalistic level.\n\n===\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\nEvery single level has a more difficult version of it, significantly lengthening the time to beat the game. I completed the first category in an hour, but the second versions are taking a bit longer.\n\nPhysics make sense and once you figure the weight of a marble, it becomes a bit easier to predict how the object in the center will spin.\n\nClearly more than one game mechanic; The second category involves you removing walls to progress, and there seems to be \"gates\" in the fourth one.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\nUses words like \"Tap\" and \"Swipe\", implying this is a bit of a rushed mobile port.\n\nMusic is just a relaxing tone - while I very much enjoy this genre, it has no variation.\nEDIT: Each section has its own though, and that only really applied for the first one.\n\nMenus, in the small amount of time that I used them, have a very mobile UI and doesn't feel right when used with a mouse.\n\n===\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, but it needs to feel less like a mobile game. I recommend adding more game mechanics instead of just having \"more levels\". A short game is great when it feels unique.\n\nBuy this game if you want a quick puzzle that involves the use of gravity, turning, and moving objects.\nDon't get it for the graphics, because it's not that sort of game.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506375708, "timestamp_created": 1506374929, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 256, "steamid": "76561198095027378", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 65, "last_played": 1506407055, "playtime_forever": 256}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
