Most buildings allow you to \"enter\" them which will teleport you onto the roof, which is great since ladders don't work!\nControls work well enough: Everything works the way you'd think with player movement. The aiming is very smooth.\nScanner works great*: You'll have a scanner button on a cooldown that can locate enemies or items on the ground.\nPlayer Customization: Very cool that you can buy all sorts of skins from points you'll earn by playing.\nCustomizing your game is none-existant right now but patches are preparing for more options in the future. Personally I feel this is when The Simple Apocalypse will be worth picking up. I like setting up off-the-wall games with friends.\n\nTHE BAD:\nThird Person feels great, but your reticle is in the wrong place. Often you'll have your target on an enemy only to have your shots hitting a wall, while changing to first person, you'll be able to hit the same enemy without issue. Originally it was much worse than it is now, so I can't complain, just wanted those who aren't sure on the gunplay to know the mechanics.\nPoor ai has seen a big improvement after some patches. The zombies still run straight for you (as they should), but the enemy projectiles and aiming has been tweaked and isn't so aim-bot.\nVehicles are sluggish: Vehicles are fun and overpowered, but the acceleration is way too slow. It wouldn't be so much of an issue if the streets weren't so tiny and you didn't get stuck on every little item in the map which forces you to accelerate from 0.\nYou drop your weapon when you go into a vehicle: I don't know why this is even in the game. I guess the vehicle counts as a gun pickup? Or maybe it's to prevent everyone from using them?\n\nOverall, I still can't recommend The Simple Apocalypse at the moment. The game is worth the asking price to be sure, and the recent / quick patch response is great, but what can I say? I still get bored before the round is even over and have had more fun on Roblox Zombie games.\nOnce match customization gets added, or a proper infection mode where one or more players start as zombies, trying to kill / \"turn\" human players to their side, then I'll definitely recommend.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "11", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506475489, "timestamp_created": 1506106821, "developer_response": "Thank you for your input!
