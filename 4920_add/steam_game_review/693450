Lot of game moments are improved I think, most appreciated thing for me is a feature to leave battle, no more need to wait until time is over or all ships destroyed.\n\nWhat I want from future games is a better infantry part, maybe it is a possible to expend harbor attacks and defences in this area.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504765723, "timestamp_created": 1504765723, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "steamid": "76561198007111818", "num_reviews": 28, "num_games_owned": 152, "last_played": 1506343899, "playtime_forever": 451}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34771177", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509461", "review": "PRO\nstrong artificial intelligence\nbeautiful models of the ships\ninteresting historical subject\nvariability and gameability\nreasonable price\nyou can finish the battle at any time (novelty)\n\nCON\nthere is no multiplayer\nthere is no custom battle mode\nthere is no in-game tutorial (only a manual)", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504683740, "timestamp_created": 1504683740, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198267874751", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 13, "last_played": 1504680130, "playtime_forever": 1052}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34789867", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "review": "Everything in this game is not as easy as it seems from the screenshots and video. This game dumbfounds its uniqueness. This is both bad and good.\n\nThe bad thing is that all the previous gaming experience does not make sense. You look at the screen and do not understand what is happening and what you need to do. And in the game there is no training. Need to read the manual. It's not bad written, but you want to play, not read. Now for me this is not a problem. I bought Totem Games products and so I figured out the game rules.\n\nOn the other hand, this uniqueness almost perfectly realizes the mechanisms of naval warfare in the 19th century. Of course, there are complaints about the interface and the strange turned based system, but this does not spoil the pleasure of the game. You can plan a whole military operation. To lure or block the enemy fleet, then defeat the coastal forts (a nice novelty), destroy the ships protecting the port and land the soldiers. Or you can concentrate your efforts on destroying enemy supply ships and blockade.\n\nI'm absolutely sure that this game is not for everyone. I see the development of the series and improvements. I hope to see the training. This is very necessary for beginners. It's hard for me to recommend this game, but I get pleasure from it.\n\n\nP.S.
