Most of my time is going into that one. [i]For now[/i].[/b]\n\nThere are few things new buyers should be aware of:\n\n[olist][*]This game is not in any shape or form similar to Transport Tycoon. You won't be optimizing routes, building long-lasting production chains, planning complex routes for dozens upon dozens vehicles, etc, etc. Instead you will be managing up to 15 not-so-smart trucks making sure they can fulfill demands of each and every town you find. Which can get a bit hectic.\n[*]This game is for patient people. You probably won't experience the real difficulty it can throw at you for a while (and by that I mean many hours of preparation and unlocking every tool the game can offer you)\n[*]Many reviews mention \"having to overcome UI\", well, it got much better. And it keeps improving. In all honesty, being late to the party, I haven't had much trouble with figuring it out.\n[*]This is not an achievement spam game. Each and any of the achievements require work. Sure, some are extremely easy, but some others are very hard.[/olist]\n\nAs for the game itself, it's the most addicting purchase I made in years. After playing for few hours I just bought everything that was available at the moment, because I knew I'll play it eventually. It might not be for everyone, probably far from it, but it's a great game if you can see its charm.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504371954, "timestamp_created": 1504371954, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198023616180", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 858, "last_played": 1504371825, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34689934", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "review": "It takes a couple of hours to get into the swing of gameplay but once you do, its nonstop.
