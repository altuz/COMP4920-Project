If anyone's interested in seeing how that went, you can check it out here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q0WzZubGfU\n\nBut that aside, I instantly got annoyed with this before even playing it due to the fact it opens in 800x600 fullscreen, and there seems to be no way at all to make it windowed. Though this is something of a more subjective issue, as it made things more problematic to record the previously mentioned video. Otherwise it may not matter to most.\n\nAs mentioned by others, other problems with this include there only being one life and no save functionality (you die, you start from the beginning). Hitboxes are larger than the sprites so while you may think you will escape a shot in reality you'll just suddenly get the 'Game Over' screen and be kicked to the main menu. And there's no dynamic to the sound (no sfx at all, just constant music) or gameplay (admittedly I only got to the second stage before I grew tired of this game, but it appeared to just all be the same gameplay and sprites, just with a different background).\n\nSome say this could just be an asset flip and/or project to farm Steam cards.
