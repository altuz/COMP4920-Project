I like the atmosphere and the fast pasced action. This game has some bugs but it seems the developer(s) are active and working to improve the game. I am using Oculus and it works fine with touch controllers. No snap turn so you need to turn your body so I recommend you have room scale if using the Oculus. I think this game has a lot of potential and I will definitely be watching the updates.

Sure, there might be a boss or something more interesting at some point, but it got old before an hour of play and I found myself rushing floors just to see if the game was changing or repeating the same dungeon type.\nI did manage to see caves and a sewer-like castle with man-sized skeletons, but decided to stop and come back to it later.\n\nJust as a heads up if you decide to purchase, there's a lot of controls the game doesn't teach you. I'm using the HTC Vive and found that the left touch-pad would move you faster if pressed (rather than just having your thumb hover over the button) and pressing up on the touch-pad would show the stats of weapons. While you can duel-wield and instantly kill everything, the game seems intended for one hand with a weapon and the other to pickup everything else.\n\nStill recommend it, but fingers crossed the game adds some content. At least it's better than TimetoDie >_>", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505678831, "timestamp_created": 1505678831, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "steamid": "76561197970754349", "num_reviews": 93, "num_games_owned": 469, "last_played": 1506817515, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35243007", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502066", "review": "Eventhough I like the artstyle of the game, there are still too many things missing.\n\nThere is not enough gameplay content, you encounter a few enemies with no abilities and simply smash them til they die.

While I waited, I discovered another VR dungeon crawler which is just a demo for an upcoming game and it can be found here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/686360/Dungeons__Treasure_VR/\n\nFirst things first, I just calibrated my room settings to make sure of this but the floor is unreachable.  There will be pieces of paper that give you instructions or missions and if you drop them you're screwed.  At best I've found using a weapon to flip them over and then trying to hover over and read them is what works best currently.  \n\nThere is pretty much no sound.  Good sound design is what really immerses me, and most people, into games in general.  \n\nI can walk through furniture which breaks immersion.\n\nI can't comment on too much else because I CAN'T LEAVE THE FREAKING TUTORIAL ROOM!  I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing seems to allow me to escape this soundless and cold cabin with a door built for giants.  Proportions are off and the door just feels and looks out of place.  There's no clear knob and you can't pull it.  My controller vibrates and the instructions told me to pull the trigger so I have.  Nothing works.  It just keeps vibrating.\n\nThe demo I mentioned has movement options and this one uses the controller breaking, \"click to run\" although that's using the word 'run' very loosely  It's unbearably slow to move around and having to click and hold on the trackpad is a known reason some people later have issues if they continue to play games that rely on it.  That felt worth mentioning that there are NO OPTIONS for ANYTHING.\n\nAnyways, even if I got past these gamebreaking bugs I'm very wary of what may lie beyond the door. \n\n3/10 - I can't play the game and a demo has more ambience than this.", "votes_down": 32, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505590597, "timestamp_created": 1505583015, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198099283936", "num_reviews": 44, "num_games_owned": 631, "last_played": 1505582366, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
