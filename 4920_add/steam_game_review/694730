The game isn't scary it's flawed and no fun at all. The enemies in this game are well I'll explain sometimes they see you and then 3 seconds later they forget you or sometimes they just keep up chasing you endlessly and when you hide in a building for some strange reason they can see you through the friggin walls. Also the graphics are bugged and look like shit. I lost interest in the game after 16 minutes believe me it was that boring. This game is stupid and is nothing but a cash-grabber.

I can barely tell if my flashlight is indeed working. \n\nIn EVIL PARK (hereafter refered to as PARK GAME) you need to  collect fuel to get a boat running so you can escape. The only real escape from PARK GAME is using the alt-f4 on your keyboard. Only then will you be free from this terrible headache, though it may haunt your nights for many weeks to follow. \n\nPARK GAME offers little in the way of scares, unless you are frightened by a dude with a sack on his head. I would recommend this game to children who are looking for something to kill time before the next Five Nights at Freddy's sequel.\n\n\n0 STARS!\n\nedit: I would like to note that I never did see an actual evil park and feel greatly let down by this fact.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505197033, "timestamp_created": 1505196985, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197970977129", "num_reviews": 74, "num_games_owned": 1001, "last_played": 1505196829, "playtime_forever": 19}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
