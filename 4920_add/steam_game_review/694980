You'll hear the same sexy saxophone solo pretty frequently...but it's not mind numbing so that's a plus.\n\nThere are some frustrating spots (namely 4 Star, level 7) that seem to be at the whims of the RNG gods in terms of getting your Pelican where you want it to be. Rest assured, it CAN be done but it's extremely frustrating after about 20 restarts or so. \n\nA couple puzzles make use of the Heavy Pelican quite interestingly for achieving 3 and 4 stars. It's satisfying to figure out those little tricks.\n=============================================\n\nIf you like Physics Platforming puzzle type games like Angry Birds, this will give you something to do for an hour to several hours depending on skill and ability to learn.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505776599, "timestamp_created": 1505776599, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "steamid": "76561198002525181", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 401, "last_played": 1506654193, "playtime_forever": 100}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
