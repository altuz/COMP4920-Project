Those games being:\n\nAchievement Hunter: Begins\nAchievement Hunter: Cromulent\nAchievement Hunter: Darkness\nAchievement Hunter: Darkness 2\nAchievement Hunter: Overdose\nAchievement Hunter: Pharaoh\nAchievement Hunter: Spinner Edition\nAchievement Hunter: Wizard\nZen vs Zombie (Achievment Hunter)\n\nAs well as at the time of writing this, the following upcoming games will no doubt be the same:\nAchievement Hunter: Dogger\nAchievement Hunter: Foxy\nAchievement Hunter: Kilborg\nAchievement Hunter: Offensive\nAchievement Hunter: Urban 2\n\nThese games are all the same, with the exceptions perhaps being Spinner Edition and Zen vs Zombie. But alas, the rest are pretty much identical aside from the way they're skinned, a mindless barrage of crap flying towards you while you try and shoot at them with your supplied weapon of defence at snail pace. They're pretty much impossible to play because no effort at all has been put into them, they're without a doubt an asset pack that's just being used over and over again.\n\nNow given the name of these games, you're probably not interested in playing the actual game. You just want the 5000+ achievements in each one of these games right? Well enjoy gaining around 99% of them each time because their always seems to be atleast 1 or 2 broken achievements in which the developer just refuses to fix, therefore you'll never achieve a perfect game.\n\nI'm beginning to wonder if \"putilin_industries\" is in fact another one of Zonitron Productions/Silicon Echo's sock puppet accounts. Do we really need this trash on Steam? Steam Direct is a total failure, I've yet to see an actual decent game come through the system due to endless supply of garbage being thrown up. Oh, how I miss Greenlight.\n\nTL/DR: Don't buy this crap. I mean fair play if you want easy achievements but the more people buy these poor excuses for games. The longer it'll take for Valve to take action against it and hopefully scrap Steam Direct. Report these games and buy something decent with your hard earned cash. Besides, what does having 100K+ worthless achievements actually achieve?
