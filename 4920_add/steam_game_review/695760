I have only three problems with this game overall. \n\nThe first would be the subtle grammar errors on some parts (I don't remember where though). If you don't have a problem with that, then that's great. \n\nThe second would be the at the very end of the game where you are allowed to select up to 3 of the girls, I ran into a problem on one occassion where the game just went back to the part where two of the girls were in crystal form after I briefly went into the dungeon. Everyone else reverted to their dialogues when they were in that form. It probably was rare since it only happened once with me and my complusive saving saved the day. \n\nThe last one would be how slow the battles are. I prefer something a bit faster or  something at least gives me the option to auto select my most recent turn so that I won't have to mash the same key/button on a very tanky enemy.\n\nOther than those problems, it's a good game to play when you have nothing else to do for an entire weekend or school break.
