Like another great example, \"Overcooked\", this game has perfectly captured the essence of co-operative play, and player co-ordination to achieve victory. Unlike most co-op games, trying to \"be the best guy\" doesn't fly here. You'll work together, running around the castle interior, creating cannonballs, powder, honey traps, and shooting enemy troops with cannons. It's a LOT of fun, and I would say a must buy for anyone who enjoys local and online co-op. \n\nPros:\n+ Designed around co-operative play\n+ The \"lone wolf\" mentality is rightly the worst choice, as should be the case in a good co-op experience (see Overcooked as another great example of this)\n+ Quick to learn\n+ Encourages participation from gamers of a variety of skill levels\n+ Encourages strong communication between players\n+ The screen is tidy, and everything sized just right to lend to visual clarity\n+ Up to 4 players can play at once\n+ The game respond really well to your inputs. Great controller support\n\nCons:\n- No voice chat for online co-op (hopefully it will be added in a future update)\n- No possibility for 2 or 3 local players play online (to have a 4 player party)", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507072510, "timestamp_created": 1507072510, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 790, "steamid": "76561197975983302", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 253, "last_played": 1507173570, "playtime_forever": 790}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35451070", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Overcooked like castle defending with MP and Co-op, BUY IT!", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507047758, "timestamp_created": 1507047758, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561197996648912", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 574, "last_played": 1507047418, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35454261", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Very nice and fluid movements and gameplay, if you like to play some fast paced casual defense with your friends, this is the game!\n\nThe only thing I wish is be able to skip the start story because it was too long.\n\nRecomended!", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507056810, "timestamp_created": 1507056810, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 134, "steamid": "76561198005712394", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 16, "last_played": 1507013798, "playtime_forever": 134}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35463367", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "Fun little coop game.
