The game's idea was amazing and it could get very popular very fast. As of now this game is in beta and it is horrible. I went into this game thinking it was going to be like Garry's Mod DarkRP but without the little kids screaming curse words into their mic when their parents are out for the night. But it was the complete opposite. Servers get around two people a whole day and there is no server that gets over ten. The graphics although are meant to not be the best but the movements and controls are horrible. The mic volume is so low and only little kids get this game so there is no roleplay what so ever. I have been on different servers and grinded so hard and once I have a bunch of stuff I will either be randomly killed by a little kid with no admins on or an indian hacker will spam chat and arrest everyone. The whole game is just walking around with a bunch of NPC's (Around 300 of them). I am sorry but I wasted my money and I hope you do not do the same.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504984578, "timestamp_created": 1504984578, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198325179084", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 22, "last_played": 1504133167, "playtime_forever": 240}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34944498", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499715", "review": "Honestly played this all night, 101% worth it", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505377569, "timestamp_created": 1505377569, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198181376158", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 65, "last_played": 1505508190, "playtime_forever": 448}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35315888", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498340", "review": "It's like a 12 year old downloaded unity for the first time and this is the first game he made", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506727693, "timestamp_created": 1506727693, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "steamid": "76561198072059118", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 83, "last_played": 1506679268, "playtime_forever": 26}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35088942", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492788", "review": "nICE", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505929581, "timestamp_created": 1505929581, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198158505381", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 18, "last_played": 1505967063, "playtime_forever": 401}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34754963", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480952", "review": "GTA for poor people.
