I assume somehow it didn't show in the 'upcoming' list of games for some reason because otherwise it would have gotten my attention ahead of time. So here we have Faria: Starfall a 16-Bit like JRPG, while it is a RPG Maker title, it is a beautifully made one with custom made graphics I believe, it start on a premise similar to what Lufia II did way back in time, I have yet to see how the story will evolve beyond this early dynamic, I assume the story development here is a bit slower than it was in Lufia.\n\nNow where Faria: Starfall differs from the typical JRPG game is in the gameplay, their is no leveling, hardly seemingly any skills, the game instead seem to be based heavily on crafting, a bit like a Survival game, its all about gathering raw resources to turn into various items to employ in battle and for crafting Relics, its hard to know the exact length of what might be available, their are no Status page to see your character's stats. Anyhow this reminds me a bit of some of some Alchemist games I played years ago, which also relied on gathering items to make stuff, its a fairly unique approach still to a JRPG, one that could be deemed more realistic than normal JRPG with their seemingly normal characters level grinding into minor deities by the end of some games. I'll admit however that at the start the combat is a bit on the basic and difficult side of things, and you'll need to unlock some of the craftables to start having an easier time at fighting and start to delve in a more complex form of combat. Also this game doesn't have random encounters, instead it has the less used but still common system of having the monsters visible on the map, but in this game they seemingly only roam around, they don't go after you, so you can choose if you want to fight or not.\n\nActually the beginning is not all that is like Lufia II... its a JRPG game with puzzles in dungeons required to be accomplished to progress... just like Lufia II, I have to say on a very personal note that is the one aspect of Lufia II I could have done without, but that is more a question of personal taste than a flaw of the game. Further in my game, I can again say this... puzzles... are a hard thing... you don't need to fear game over, but puzzles you'll fear for sure, they are multiple and some are pretty difficult, from intelligence based puzzles like in Lufia II to a far more difficult type of speed and reflex based puzzles, its a challenging game for sure. Seem however some of those puzzles got a 'easy bypass' that allow to skip them, but its not universal, I'll say if you use mouse and keyboard to play the game, the mouse might be the key to deal with some of those speed & reflex ones in a manner that won't drive you insane.\n\nNow while employing 16-Bit like graphics I have to see the game is fairly pretty and colorful, it seem like much of the stuff is custom made, albeit many monsters are based on common tropes from RPG and JRPG games. The music is also fairly good, most of what I have been exposed to tend to be more cheery happy music, in the town, field and beach, in battle you've got a cheery action with maybe a carnivalous tone music, I got some more mysterious type of music with a slight dramatic tone in a cave, so overall its very appropriate music too, also the music hasn't been a problem to listen to unlike some games where you rush to shut it off, this one is pretty nice to let run. The writing is also fairly nice, it has a very quality literature look to it, it has, I'll admit, a few clich\u00e9 stuff and a couple of typos, but still its nice to look at, largely still fairly easy to follow, and is quite well made overall still.\n\nAnyhow its not to say the game is perfect, like I said its confusing due to the lack of Status Page, it also has at the point I have a lack of Map, which make it difficult to figure my characters up and finding my way around, but those don't rate that much compared to all the positive.\n\nSo in the end I do recommend the game to people that want a good JRPG, that are willing to embrace a fairly novel gameplay compared to normal JRPG, a JRPG with a fairly in-depth background setting, where you can gather up items and make Relics that will reveal small glimpses in the lore of the game, the Developer of this game obviously love the game and is very passionate about it, its a beautiful work of love for sure. I'd give the game the tentative note of 7.5/10 for this game, I'll need to get far more advanced in the game to be able to get a proper grasp at the storyline, the characters and the gameplay to be able to decide if the grade I gave it is right, the faults I noted are not the end of the world, I'll need to see more to see if it get better or worse. So yea, at this price, with an expected 20 hours on a first run at least, if you don't go after every single relics, its a solid price for a good game.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505943307, "timestamp_created": 1505675749, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198017382987", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 365, "last_played": 1505847756, "playtime_forever": 479}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35013620", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501159", "review": "I actively dislike this game.
