The puzzles all fit together and the shortcuts are fun and satisfying af, shortcut porn mastered for sure. Music is phenomonal as always. The story has a lot of really cool underlying themes and definitely follows the theme of Off Peak nicely. I actually read what characters said as opposed to skimming through and for me that's pretty rare.. Super impressed.\n\nFor anyone considering this, play Off Peak first, it's free on the Steam store, is an 800mb download and you will know pretty quickly if Norwood is a game for you but honestly, I can tell you it already is ;).

I suggest you try his first game called the Off-Peak (which is free) before purchasing. The game is not for everyone and I found the music pretty annoying sometimes. The characters mumble in a sort of music artsy form so you have to read the script. I dont mind reading but there is too much use of strange music sounds. Apart from that factor, I thought the map was pretty visually with the night sky and neon colours. The game design enjoyable as well. Everyone in the hotel needs you to find something for them.

The music is phenomenal to say the least, the visuals are unique, and the dialogue is very in-depth and interesting to read. Hotel Norwood was a very fun environment to explore, and I can't wait to find out how the story unfolds!\n\nIf you enjoyed Off-Peak, this is a must-have. If you're on the fence, try out Off-Peak (it's free!) and if you find yourself wanting more - The Norwood Suite is an excellent successor.\n\nPerformance wise, I had no issues running the game fairly steadily over 60fps (avg. ~90-100fps). A few times I did notice the framerate drop to around 30-40 for a few seconds, but nothing major. It runs far better than Off-Peak did. You can view my system specs on my profile if you're interested.\n\nAs for issues/bugs, I encounted very few problems. Nothing was game-breaking in any way and overall it's been a really solid game.\n\nOverall it's a fantastic experience and the asking price is very fair!

If you enjoyed Off-Peak, definitely give this one a go as it will be worth your money (and help support a fantastic artist). There is a stronger and easier-to-follow storyline to this game, yet has many many underlying themes. This along with the atmosphere of a dreamy backwoods hotel housing some really interesting guests (that felt worth listening to) made this game all the more of a step up from Off-Peak. \n\nGlad to have payed for this one, even if my total playtime was a little short.

It was finally a game that I thought was literally made for me. The music hit just right, and the surreal setting was perfect and it set an attitude to what you'll see througout the rest of the game. Shortly after I finished I was so eager for more I discorvered that he was making a second, and I instantly became addicted to the thought of it, waiting for newsletters to release every day. Then when the release date was annouced and the setting was annouced I counted down the days, I haven't even finished the game yet but its oh so pleasing to look at, and its giving me eargasms ever second. BTW this is probably a super bias review, but rightfully deserved, the first game was really good for a dev with little things to use to make it. As I was looking through the reviews for the game I noticed a negative one, so I checked it out, and Cosmo D was in the comment section (Dev of the games) and he helped this guy out and gave him a free code to redeem for the soundtrack of the game, for free, just because he had a problem with a game.
