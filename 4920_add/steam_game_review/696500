It crashed twice on startup. There are no tutorials that i can find. All the guns sound the exact same. Weird things dont work, like for example when you pick up the AR it wont let you move (which is by teleportation only) but the other guns still let you move. But then i cant find a way to drop the gun ive just picked up. The sounds are way off. Like some are crazy loud and others arent so much. Also when you die it just instantly puts you back at the beginning of the level and its a little sudden and weird feeling. I also cant seem to quit back to the menu or even pause the game.\n\nI will say this. The guns look decent. The enemy models look really good actually. The level design is alright. It looks like some real work went into it and for that i do give a thumbs up to the devs but honestly its worth maybe $5-$10 if they can fix the bugs.\n\nThe game is a wave shooter type. Just hold the line and kill bad dudes and if you kill enough you get a new level. Although i think there are only like 4 or 5 total levels.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504914783, "timestamp_created": 1504914783, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972324850", "num_reviews": 23, "num_games_owned": 503, "last_played": 1504912769, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 18, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34829511", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524875", "review": "Got refund after 16mins of play, game needs alot of work,idea is good but it's nowhere near ready for distribution.
