I'll say off the bat that this game is not worth the current asking price of 25 dollars as it is just shy of unplayable right now. Again, the potential is there, and if you have money to burn, and feel like being generous/helping the developer out, then go for it as I'm sure you will find no end of suggestions and bugs to report. The ADS is broken and won't work if you click it more than once in rapid succession, the terrain is just as dangerous as the enemies as it's very easy to get stuck, and the AI is in really rough shape.
