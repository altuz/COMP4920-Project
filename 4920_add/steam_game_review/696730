So thumbs up.\n\nOverall, I bought it due to the style.  I beat it in one sitting, in just over 3 hours.  I'm older, so I'm not the best at platformers anymore, so I'd rate this game as fairly easy.\n\nSide note:  Sound was 0 when I first started, playing, at first I thought maybe there was no sound, but, after looking in menus, I realized all sound was set to 0 on start, which is a bit strange.\n\nFor a platform, the controls don't really feel that great (mainly the jumping).  I used a 360 controller, which doesn't seem to work in the menu's, I had to use keyboard for that.  \n\nIn game, the controller worked okish, however, I found any scene where you're riding something and being chased, I had to switch to keyboard, as whenever I went diagonal on the controller, it slowed movement speed way down, which in a chase scene, pretty much meant death.  I beat it first try when I switched to keyboard for this section.\n\nThe checkpoints are pretty close together.\n\nI believe the 2nd of 3 chase scenes, I just flat out cheated, for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to get away.\n\nThe few boss fights were fun.  It was more along the lines of a puzzle/pattern to beat them.\n\nOverall though I enjoyed the quirky story, music, atmosphere, and art style, which is why I gave it a thumbs up.

Controls feel just awful, with movement being painfully slow yet still imprecise and jumping barely clearing the many obstacles in the game. Many times, I would jump toward the next ledge and get stuck on the side due to the character's arm clipping into the environment. Internal consistency also presents an issue: At some points you are required to drop into a pit to progress, though pits throughout the rest of the game serve as instant deaths. Enemies present little risk other than by providing more obstacles to jump over, and getting rid of them requires firing the equivalent of Megaman's lemons at roughly 1/20th the rate. The one part of this game that could be considered any fun at all would be the chase scenes, which do add some tension (though only for a small while). \n\nIf you want a comparison, it feels similar to the videogame adaptation of MANOS, but even MANOS manages to be more satisfying.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504565876, "timestamp_created": 1504565876, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198067580475", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 2052, "last_played": 1504564868, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
