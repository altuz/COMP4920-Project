The setting looks stunning and the game runs very smooth. I was a bit wary of the game as there's nothing out there to watch gameplay wise other than a few trailers. Priced at $30, it's a bit of a gamble but one I'm glad I took. When I first saw the trailer, the movie Gangs of New York sprang to mind, whether this is in a similar vein only time will tell. I was a bit disappointed the dialogue isn't voice acted, for $30 I expected it to be but that doesn't detract from the game.\n\nI'm looking forward to continue playing the game, I've only encountered one \"fight\" but it seems to have a strategy to it.\n\nCheck out the video below (no commentary) and see whether the game is for you. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/aAJb2eawGHw\n\n", "votes_down": 13, "language": "english", "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507161117, "timestamp_created": 1507161117, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "steamid": "76561198168764957", "num_reviews": 21, "num_games_owned": 90, "last_played": 1507191734, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 35, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35492557", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465177", "review": "This is such a bad game I really regret ibought it there is such a lack og userfriendliness here I wont advice any to buy it this is so amateurish work for 30 euro shame on you develepors for letting your customers down there is literall\ny no explanation of what to do when you are stuck in missions let me get away from this game", "votes_down": 15, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507202697, "timestamp_created": 1507202697, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "steamid": "76561198006736389", "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 267, "last_played": 1507204586, "playtime_forever": 113}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
