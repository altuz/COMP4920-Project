For a tie-in low budget game, the animation was particularly impressive. The character's movements and facial expressions were all very well done and a ton of fun to watch.\n-Being in the cockpit of the blue lion is just awesome. \n-The game is fully voice acted by the cast of the show. They do a great job as usual. \n\nCONS:\n-It is very short, just barely an hour long from start to finish. \n-The gameplay is just too easy. I was playing very sloppily and I still made it through without encountering a failstate \n-Flying the lion is reistricted to a predetermined path with limited movement. Some sort of free flying mode is sorely missed oppourtunity.\n-The scaling in the cutscenes with the characters was really inconsistant. The villain's height seemed to fluctuate with each cutscene, and Allura and Coran looked tiny. It really breaks the immersion factor when you are standing next to the hero's and villains and they are comically short.  \n\nGameplay consist mainly of watching cutscenes, solving simplistic puzzles, and simple flying and shooting mechanics. Be warned that some of the cutscenes involve a lot of camera movement, so those sensative to motion sickness may get a bit dizzy. I know I was by the end of it.\n\nIf you are a fan of this show, as I am, then you will have no regrets buying this game. Kids will also have a great time if you want to pick it up for them. I wouldn't go buying a VR headset just for this game though. \n\nOther than that, there really isn't any reason to it. This game was entirely meant to entertain fans of the show, and was very clearly targeted towards children. There is nothing particularly innovative or unique outside getting to experience the show in VR.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506446078, "timestamp_created": 1506445960, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "steamid": "76561198044089796", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 81, "last_played": 1506446860, "playtime_forever": 71}, "votes_up": 13, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35226144", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523347", "review": "DreamWorks Voltron VR Chronicles is an enjoyable interactive VR experience set in the universe of the Netflix series. The voice actors and animation are the best part of the game but it falls rather flat in terms of gameplay, plot and length. The story is incredibly generic with the only unique part being a mysterious alien device that infects the lions and castle. The only point of this however is to add a series of minigames and it is ultimately pretty pointless. Flying the blue lion is also not a very enjoyable experience; it's like playing a very boring rail shooter with no real challenge; it gives you no real freedom which is a shame as I was hoping for some epic space battles like in the show. The only really enjoyable part of the game comes at the end; in which there is a rather fun but short boss fight that gives you strafing controls for the lion, making it a lot more engaging than the rest of the game. \n\nThe biggest letdown in this experience was the length, it takes less than an hour to fully complete and has no extras or real replayability value; you can just start over and experience it from the beggining again. For some VR titles this would be ok but in order to make it work you need a lot more interactivity to pull you back into the experience. Voltron is just too linear and gives the player no freedom which is a shame. It would be so much fun to have been given the option to explore the castle of lions or even just the paladins rooms. I did enjoy the very end of the game, when the paladins finally manage to form Voltron; but sadly it takes place in a very short cinematic in which you have no control.\n\nOverall I really wanted to make this a positive recommendation, but I just feel there's not enough to DreamWorks Voltron VR Chronicles to warrant the price. If it were a free to play experience I would hands down reccomend it but as it stands it is in no way worth it as of now. \n\nIn short DreamWorks Voltron VR Chronicles (Although it should probably just be Chronicle since it's a single short adventure) is a decent experience that you can clearly tell a lot of love was put into by the creators of the show; it is held back by it's length, price tag, linear story, mostly uninspiring gameplay and lack of replayability.\n\nVrepit Sa.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506446538, "timestamp_created": 1506446538, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "steamid": "76561198058481343", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 1064, "last_played": 1506445654, "playtime_forever": 53}, "votes_up": 15, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35227628", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512819", "review": "Video of gameplay: https://youtu.be/i1jbDxjYD7A\n\nLet me start off with saying the graphics in this game are amazing.

By the way before I get started, I love voltron and im a huge fan, the voice actors and the creators work really hard and do such a good job. Its so cool they even came out with a game, and its such a great communtity. Also (Klance) sorry I had too. But Lance, and Keith, and Shiro, and Pidge, and Hunk, and Allura, and Coran such amazing characters I love them all, (and everyone else) along with their voice actors. So the game...\nThe pros are, well 1st the graphics and animation. Such great facial expressions and the lions and the Galra and the universe, its all so great. From the enviroment to the people showing up on the screen when they talk. Another pro is that all the chracters are the same voice actors, which is awesooommeee. Along with audio, you still have people saying lance did a good job or the little bickerings between Lance and Keith. The only thing I can complain about is the length and the freedom you get, not alot. The freedom? You cant ride the lion around anywhere other than the missions, you cant walk in the castle or around the rooms. One thing I found dissapointing was how you could only play as Lance. I love Lance with all my heart, but Ijust wanted to see things from other paladin's perspectives. And the last 'con' was the length. I recorded myself playing it for some reason, I guess just to see my first reaction, and it was less then, almost an hour. And that included some struggling, but now that I know what to do it would probably be like 30-40 minutes of game play. You form Voltron once but you dont play as Voltron itself. For the short amount of length I guess it was a little high up price wise, but overall it really is a great game, so I dont regret it. I hope to see updates maybe? If this does really well maybe they will? But anyways, I reccomend this game if you are a fan of Voltron Legendary Defender. :)", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506462103, "timestamp_created": 1506462103, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "steamid": "76561198117865468", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 41, "last_played": 1506461027, "playtime_forever": 74}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35232125", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501243", "review": "The graphics were great, everything looked almost exactly like the show only with a few slight differences.

I was pretty dissapointed with the game.  A lot of people are saying that the graphics and animations were the best part of the game.  They wern't great.  They definitely emulated the style of the show really well however, the scale was really wonky the whole game.  Sometimes I was the size of a lion, and other times I was a few inches tall.  Things that are supposed to be far away feel very close.  Some of the animations were pretty cool (like Coran's introduction), but many were awful and immersion breaking.  There was a lot of things that shook during this game , but nothing really shook with any weight to it.  Everything just kinda vibrated which might work in a 2d game but looks like hot garbage in VR.  \n\nThe game is more of an interactive movie than a game.  You solve puzzles in between cutscenes.  The puzzles are really easy.  It's all stuff like connect the dots, match the shape, ect.  I get that it's a cartoon for kids but most kids don't have a VR rig.\n\nThe only gameplay other than puzzles are these segments where you \"Pilot\" the blue lion.  You barely need to participate in these segments.  The only punishment for taking damage is you have to listen to everbody winge at you for getting hurt.  No healthbars, no game overs.  You aim by looking at enemy ships and sorta steer with your arms.  You're on rails but you can shift around ever so slightly.  Wee!\n\nThe best part of the game is the boss fight at the end, and even that got tedious by the end of it.  They *really* dragged it out.\n\nThe game had the full voice acting cast and they did a decent job.  I laughted at a few lines.\n\nThe game was a little under an hour.  I 90% of it totally motionless.  Any time the game actually game me the chance to **do** something everybody wanted to tell me what to do over and over.  I GET IT I HAVE TO CHARGE MY LASERS I JUST KILLED LIKE 20 DUDES WITH MY LASERS!  There isn't anything about the story that stands out.  Zarkon just kind of stands there motionless while he makes evil plans with his waifu.  Alura's model (and Coran's) is defintiely better endowed than her TV counterpart, so that's a plus!\n\nNothing special about this interactive movie.  2/10", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506657626, "timestamp_created": 1506657524, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "steamid": "76561198042062250", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 150, "last_played": 1506657919, "playtime_forever": 55}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35229372", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496336", "review": "If the developer was committed to more episodes, then this would be a great start.
