Portal blocks? Check. Reverse blocks? Check. Multiplayer? Check.\n\nOld school players will definitely feel at home playing Ophidian and it keeps things fresh to bring in a new crowd.\nI've never been very interested in \"Snake-like\" games but this one is definitely addicting. It's very well polished and runs amazing and has a huge amount of content. The challenges will keep even the most expert players playing for hours on end.\nThe price is amazing for a game of this quality. If you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and buy this game.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505529918, "timestamp_created": 1505529918, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "steamid": "76561198075699949", "num_reviews": 6, "num_games_owned": 305, "last_played": 1506890206, "playtime_forever": 429}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
