I know nothing that will save me once the bombs come and I make a living working with criminals.  I've never touched a video synth, but I can comfortably flex on most other types. I prefer hardware, and I can't tolerate latency. \n\nMeat: I want this product to succeed. I feel connected to it in the same way modular first grabbed me. I want to learn why it moves the way it does. I don't understand video production, but my synth knowledge (and basic xsplit foundation) got me where I needed to be to at least spit out a video for YouTube. I fully acknowledge that I've got a lot to learn, but I want to be the first review so I can (hopefully) make others aware of the potential of this software. \n\nI really hope this thing succeeds and I thank the dev for inspiring me to keep working and learning. I'll certainly be spending many more hours with this synth. \n\nHere's to the nightmares and seizures and ecstacy this thing is capable of giving the world. Thank you!\n\nDefinitely worth it.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504932947, "timestamp_created": 1504932947, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197972750353", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 569, "last_played": 1505081278, "playtime_forever": 288}, "votes_up": 13, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
