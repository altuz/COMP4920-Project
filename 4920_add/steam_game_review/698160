Pretty much this is a \"die respawn, die-respawn\" game. You will spend an insane amount of time not being able to see anything due to the game being black, and the AI will be confusing and badly implimented. I would say this is closer to a Beta than a final release. Glitchy, not all of the graphics line up, and it is just \"everthing respawns\" game.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504590373, "timestamp_created": 1504590373, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197963607828", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 95, "last_played": 1504589817, "playtime_forever": 43}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
