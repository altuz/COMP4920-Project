The entire games content can be cleared in about 20 minutes. Spent 40 minutes trying to figure out how to go to another level only to find out that its only scenery. The game has about 10 unique monsters that you can fight and there absolutely no lore explained throughout this game. Might come back when there is more content but this game feels like a cheap cash grab and there is no point in buying it. I am currently pending a refund.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506871833, "timestamp_created": 1506871833, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "steamid": "76561197993623424", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 1045, "last_played": 1506871136, "playtime_forever": 80}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
