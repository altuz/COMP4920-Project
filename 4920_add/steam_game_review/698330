One control... LMB. Clicking is all you do to turn the van left or right (the game will automatically turn you on the rails, but will allow you to turn suddenly into a wall if you double click or click at the wrong time.) Just click at the right time to stay on the road, the van speeds up at times, so you have to pay attention. The random zig-zags in the roads, and the sometimes awkwardly placed cash piles can make getting the final $5000 in one try a wee bit of a challenge. Avoiding the large cash piles for the achievement for getting $1000 in small cash piles only was also more difficult than I expected. Same with picking up no money at all in the first 30 seconds.\n\nBut, that said, none of the achievements were terribly difficult to get, just took me longer than most people, from looking at other reviews. (Probably because my bad arthritis means I have crappy reflexes, when a knuckle decides to pop or lock up...).  One thing to watch for is where your cursor is... click outside of the window (the cursor is NOT locked into the window), and the game minimizes, usually leading to a crash when you click to maximize the window again.  (Not an issue if you are playing in fullscreen... which I recommend.)\n\nLots of laughs for me each time I crashed. You lose no collected money when you crash, it keeps adding up in your bank, so you can save up to buy each van. Not a deep game, very simple. But VERY fun to play for short periods of time. Music and graphics make it a great pick-me-up game, and it runs great on Ultra even on the toastiest of toasters. Trading Cards would probably get people to replay it more, but we'll see if they get added with Steam's new Trading Card rules. If, not, no big deal. I'll play this again when I just need to laugh a bit and funk out to the music. \n\nReally enjoyed this little game.

Every $500  you speed up a little bit more.  Reach $5000 and you beat the game.  That's all there is to it.  You do get a bit of variety by spending in-game money to purchase a variety of different vans - some of which are nice pop culture references (A-Team, Scooby Doo, etc.).  \n\nIt's hard to decide whether or not to recommend this game.  It's pretty cheap, looks fine for it's basic style, has some funky menu music and okay sound effects, and it runs smoothly.  But it's also very basic and doesn't offer much in the way of replay value.  Maybe adding a few more maps, maybe some objectives, something along those lines to spice it up a bit.  \n\nI think I'll settle on recommend just because it does run fine, is cheap (though could be cheaper...), achieves it's goal, and it has achievements.  Who doesn't like achievements?\n\nI'm a bad driver here: https://youtu.be/-bGifruunJc", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504846971, "timestamp_created": 1504846971, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198025227359", "num_reviews": 42, "num_games_owned": 169, "last_played": 1504846538, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34856927", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500863", "review": "Fun racing where you need to react really quick or you'll crash.
