It has so many bugs it's insane.\n\n- Jumping is delayed. It's by design (so you can fall off a ledge and release Space to jump midair) but it's annoying.\n- When you get hit your character can multiply. This alone would be confusing but when you have about 10 copies of your character, the game drops down to single digit FPS.\n- Some weapons don't swing at all.\n- All weapons can be unlocked from the start since you get so much gold and there is nothing else to spend it on.\n- After you beat a level, the game will go to a black screen. You can leave it by pressing Esc, choosing Main Menu and going to the game again. However, it will mark the level you were playing as completed. It will also mark the next two levels as completed, meaning that you can skip most of the levels in the game.\n- If that black screen bug wasn't enough, it gets worse. In later levels, every level is completely black. Only the shopkeepers, your character and the doors are visible. Walls and enemies are invisible. On top of that, even if you manage to beat a level, the game has to be restarted. If you die in a level, you can try again but it makes the game lag very badly which means you pretty much have to reset.\n- One of the achievements is broken.\n\nI found all this in three hours. Do not buy this game. It is not worth it to anyone.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507053096, "timestamp_created": 1507045102, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 160, "steamid": "76561197998502792", "num_reviews": 55, "num_games_owned": 685, "last_played": 1507052897, "playtime_forever": 160}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35436113", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514909", "review": "The controls and mechanics are horrible. do not buy", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507007911, "timestamp_created": 1507007911, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "steamid": "76561198007049721", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 8, "last_played": 1507005107, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35431520", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504143", "review": "delayed jumping, pointless game...avoid this one", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506990651, "timestamp_created": 1506990651, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "steamid": "76561198141006835", "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 73, "last_played": 1506990533, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35427234", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489961", "review": "This game legit creates 50 of you lagging the game out to where one swing takes 30 seconds to load in", "votes_down": 10, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506973964, "timestamp_created": 1506973964, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198158018194", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 93, "last_played": 1506973856, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
