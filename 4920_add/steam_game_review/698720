Dont ADS. The only time you should ADS is when you are trying to kill the large emojis from a far distance. \n\n2. Shotgun- Best weapon in the game but apperentally it only kills one target and doesn't pierce. 3-4 shots will be able to kill the large emojis\n\n3. LMG ( mounted and loaded ) - Devestating to enemies that follow you. If you find a good distance.. use it but I suggest to use the revolver or somewhat of that source if you are trying to shoot floating enemies.\n\n4. Powerups. There are powerups ( Health, slow time, Sonic speed).. but they are useless unless you want to get shot to death. \n\n5. Jumping. Always Jump. That's just that. Run in a circle path,\n\n6. Reloading: This is also a huge con in the game but mainly it's for the revolver which tends to be the most risky item to use in the game but the most reliable to shoot for floating enemies if you can aim. The revolver takes the longest reload time and if you reload  it takes a good 3-ish seconds ( makes sense though ) and you can't switch to something else in the meantime.\n\nTDLR: Reload in safe places with the revolvers.\n\n------------------------------\nPROS AND CONS\n\nPros:\n1. It's actually a good-ish game when you get used to it. I'm a fan of these survival games that you can find your path and perfect it. \n\n2. It's emojis. Die Die Die.\n\n3. Music is nice when playing the game. \n\n4. Sliding ( on the revolver slope ) and jumping mechanics are great.\n\n5. The one map in the game so far actually has a good terrain and the only thing wrong is the stairs on it which should be fixed overtime\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. Bullet speed & Spread. I think most guns should have faster bullet speed ( especially the revolver ). The revolver has high damage.. useful especially when shooting floating enemies. Missing your 6 shots because the enemies are moving is too punishing for the reload time. Since you and the enemy are always moving it's very difficult to actually land a shot. The shotgun weapon at the moment is the most broken due to the little spread when shooting far distance. It's fine if I can shoot something up close, but I should not be able to shoot a large emoji across the map and land every shot, killing it in 4 shots ( this should be a job of something like a musket ).\n\n2. Weaponry- Right now, there are 5 weapons in the game: Pistol, LMG ( Heavy ), Shotgun, Revolver, and an Assult Rifle.\n\nPistol- Decent. I have no concerns about it \n\nLMG- Low spread.. but still balanced seeing how the game runs. Usually I use this on following emojis so no problem\n\nAssult Rifle- I haven't really had the time to find its position but I feel like it's projectile speed is too low for this kind of gun and with the power it delivers I think bullet speed should be faster.\n\nShotgun- No spread.. Reload time is really fast ( but needed )\n\nRevolver- Slow reload, but compensates with power.. Needs to be basically hitscan.\n\nI think the game should offer more options by having the black crates respawn different weapons.. Maybe gernades too.\n\n3. Powerups- The powerups are good in this game but they are in the middle.. which is chaos once you spend about 3-ish minutes. Basically there is no way for you to heal and the projectiles in the game will kill you because of how many there are.\n\n4. Enemies in general- I'm fine with the ones that follow. The ones that shoot projectiles though are too strong. I'm fine with the bosses but the floating ones ( Especially the vomit ones ) are just too strong with a jacked fire rate.\n\n5. Lack of Options- Motion blur, sensetivity.. some color palate backgrounds make it difficult to see enemes ( Green and Grey ones )\n\n6. Tutorial & grabbing items- It takes about 30 minutes to fully understand how to play the game and learn it.. which for most people can be a turn off about the game. Grabbing items ( mainly guns ) can be a hassle when standing either on or near the weapon crates.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nShould you get the game? \n\nFor $2 This game will keep people busy if you like the survival run-and-gun type scenario but the only thing that really sucks is the enemies build up too much for you to handle at the moment. The bullet speed along with motion blur doesn't make the situation better but it is still a fun game once you get the hang of it.\nI really liked the game and it is a great time killer if anything. \n\nI hoped that this information has helped you on your decision to buy the game or not. <3", "votes_down": 11, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505098409, "timestamp_created": 1505070660, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198149934885", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 79, "last_played": 1505674771, "playtime_forever": 165}, "votes_up": 15, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35272554", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501534", "review": "I love this game, I shouldn't love it, it does not look like a product you should endorse, but it is $2 well spent, and the dev seems to enjoy the game, and appreciate the people who play it.\n\nThe game runs good, the shooting feels good, and I find the game highly addictive.
