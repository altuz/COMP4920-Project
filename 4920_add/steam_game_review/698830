The mechanics are frustrating, since the +1 turn bonuses seem to drop randomly 4+ matches. It\u2019s very easy to run out of turns due to plain bad luck. Since each \u201cdate\u201d has different preferences for the yellow, green, and red categories, your entire game can be made impossible if that colour simply doesn\u2019t drop enough \u2014 which happens quite frequently as you date more people.\n\n[h1]Graphics [8/10][/h1]\nFor a casual puzzle game, it accomplishes a simple, uncluttered interface that is clean and minimalistic. That said, the characters aren\u2019t memorable and neither is the interface. See HuniePop or Gems of War for how to make a puzzle game pop. :P\n\n[h1]Soundtrack [5/10][/h1]\nThere seems to be one very short song that plays on a loop. It\u2019s pleasant, ambient, and will instantly bring to mind royalty-free music websites. But, it\u2019s not memorable and has a very plain melody at best. Good for maybe 10-20 minutes, tops.\n\n[h1]Replayability [4/10][/h1]\nThis is a very generous score, being that there\u2019s no sense of progress. You date people and the game gets progressively more difficult until you fail a date. After that, you start from scratch. You don\u2019t get powerups, bonuses, or any way to track your points.\n\n[h1]Overall [5/10][/h1]\nIt\u2019s not a fun puzzle game. I was bored within 15 minutes of playing and managed to snag the achievements quite quickly despite the difficulty with RNG. That said, for $1.09 CDN, I\u2019d give it 5/10. I wouldn\u2019t buy it or play it again, but it could be a fun distraction for 5-10 minutes.\n\n[h1]Game-Specific Comments[/h1]\nLike M. Hanka\u2019s other game, Voodoo Garden, the tutorial and descriptions in English are a little lackluster. Mechanics aren\u2019t fully explained (eg., that humour, the +1 turn mechanic doesn\u2019t always appear with 4+ matches) so a short period of trial-and-error is required.\n\nHope you enjoyed my review of Puzzle Dating!
