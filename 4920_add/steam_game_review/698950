Memes are fun for a couple of minutes, but then it's better to turn them off to play game normally (some jokes were lost in translation, so it's not a big deal anyway). Game is nicely drawn and well designed. I didn't like game controls though, it could've been more user friendly - constantly using acceleration for long jumps is not fun. The only bug i've encountered was falling through floor twice. Overall it's a nice indie platformer.", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505587003, "timestamp_created": 1505587003, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197979911851", "num_reviews": 39, "num_games_owned": 8334, "last_played": 1505585643, "playtime_forever": 127}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
