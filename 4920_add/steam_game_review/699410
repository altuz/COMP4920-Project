The first few candles will be easy to find. After that you get lost or you don't find any more candles. The principle of \"always keep to the right\" would work if you could mark your paths and not accidentally run the same way again. In other words, there is basically a very valuable feature missing here, because there is no map (map is not so meaningful) and you cannot orient yourself.\nMy Xbox controller is not fully recognized, which is a pity. I can't look around.\nAll in all, I have to say that the game is not recommended. In my opinion, it's more of an alpha that needs some more features. It is not fun to move around the labyrinth, which is the core of the game.\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506972055, "timestamp_created": 1506972055, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "steamid": "76561198078514382", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 91, "last_played": 1506970832, "playtime_forever": 22}, "votes_up": 0, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
