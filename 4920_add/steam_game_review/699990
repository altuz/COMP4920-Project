Colored tiles keep rolling down the line and your job is to match 3 in any way to make space for even more tiles.  So I'm sure most of you reading this are already familiar with the game type.  The question is, does this VR game add anything to the game?\n\nThe answer is not really.  Now, the game plays well enough.  But the mechanics used don't really capture what VR is all about.  I used the Oculus Rift with motion controllers.  The first problem this game has is that for whatever reason, you're put farther away from where you're supposed to be (so you will need a good playing area to move forward so that your hands can reach into the apparatus that controls the tile catcher if you want to use your motion contollers).  You control the shifting tile catcher by putting your hand close enough to one of the 5 pillars.  The tile catcher goes to the one where your hand is.  You then press the A button to release the tile where you want.  The VR environment is very plain and the music is generic (at least you can turn it off).  But why can't I listen to my own music?  \n\nDo I recommend this game?  This is a very tough call because I got the game on sale at $1.19.  I am sure it works fine for those using a mouse and keyboard in VR and really want to play a match tile game in VR no matter the quality.  However, the game can easily be so much better in VR.\n\nHow?  Put a better VR environment.  Let us listen to our own music.  This is a relaxing game so put those things in here so we can enjoy the casual game.  What else needs to be done?  They need to add a simple mechanic that uses the touch controller to add immersion.  How about using the touch controller to move the tile catcher with our hands or body?  We can move side to side via shifting our body or by moving our feet or use our hands side to side to move the tile catcher side to side.  Then we can tip it over with our hands.  That's just common sense here.  \n\n[b]This game could easily be about moving fast enough with our bodies or hands and quick thinking to match the colored tiles and that would make this game better in VR [/b]\n\n[u]Final verdict?  Even at .99 cents, this game needs more work to make it enjoyable enough to recommend  [/u]\n\nRating 3/10", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505084566, "timestamp_created": 1505084091, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1505083182, "playtime_forever": 21}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34875561", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491592", "review": "addictive and fun!
