To this my response would be, \u201cmore than you\u2019d expect\u201d.\n\nInitially, I was lured back to the series after \u201cEpistle 3 Leaks\u201d. While I anticipated a mediocre trip aided by my nostalgia goggles, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the title aged, like fine wine that tasted better over time. There are several reasons to why I derived to this conclusion, allow me to convey each in description below.\n\nFirstly, the GoldSrc engine might be a bit dated graphically, but it is good enough to represent whatever model it needs within the game play, delivering good performances with smooth animation. You will come to appreciate how detailed the models for each entity are, despite their low polygon count. Comparing to the games today, you will noticed just how much work was put into optimisation, along with full on compatibility with a range of operating systems. Something I wish I could say the same for the developers today.\n\nSecondly, the plot of Half Life was well written by Marc Laidlaw, it is just as good today as it was back in the yesteryear. You will be drawn in by the dubious stance of Black Mesa in its teleportation research, its lack of care in human resources as well as ethics. As well as the mysterious Xen forces and Nihilanth\u2019s motive in invading Earth. The enigma that is G-Man still puzzles us to this day in who exactly he works for.\n\nThirdly, the AI technology in this game is just phenomenal. Marines would work in concert with one another, putting down suppressing fire while encircling you from behind. Houndeyes would hunt in packs with a leader, changing their behaviour and attack pattern based on the pack\u2019s strength. Vortigaunts would retreat in fear but regroup in numbers, rallying in the safety of cover. Hardly any of these advances are even visible in games today, which are just upsetting to say the least.\n\nFourthly, the arsenal which Gordon can play with is very well designed, each gun has its own specific use and none of them are ever obsolete, just because you found a new shiny gun. Each section of the stages can be tackled with different weapons in different play styles. Sure they might not be perfectly balanced in multiplayer, but a community still exists to this day for its death matches, that should speak for the quality in itself.\n\nIf you have the fortune to play Half Life before, then I believe no amount of convincing is required. However, if you came from a newer generation of video game enthusiasts, you should give this title at least a single try in your lifetime. No regrets, Mr Freeman."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506324645, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512566", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "35198077", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198042531564", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1505193193, "num_games_owned": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 993}, "timestamp_updated": 1506324645, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Who needs a sequel when I can just play the first one\nover,\nand over,\nand over again?\nhaha, look it me Ma, look at how much fun I'm having."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506393480, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502858", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35214538", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198159255487", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1506393389, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 106, "playtime_forever": 630}, "timestamp_updated": 1506393480, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Swood and addicting.

Look for \"MarphitimusBlackimus\" videos, the videos explain the many many cuts, such as Gordons' original death, the alphas and betas, and many interesting stuff!\n\n\nPROS:\n\nStoryline\n\nShooter + Puzzling - Yup, levels have shooting and puzzling which you have to move to the air vent and follow where it will lead to, and among others. With shooting, pure action too.\n\nMultiplayer. The multiplayer is very amazing. Best played with peanut butter jam sandwich. Great times. Also look for the videos of \"The Gmen Squad!\" by Xanatos, it makes you replay multiplayer again.\n\nThe Whole Concept - The concept of aliens, sci fi things and more are gracious. I really loved the wole idea and concept of headcrabs and HEV suit.\n\nThe Locations - Nevada, Black Mesa. Ever since I played the game I really want to travel to the USA and to look at the deserts of Nevada. This is probably one of the games that makes me want to see where they're bassed on. Catchy name though!\n\nExpansion Packs are Amazing.  I, F***ING LOVE, the idea to play the three (or 5, if Decay canon) the characters with each of their perspectives of the Black Mesa disaster.\n\nSO GOOD Soundtracks!!!\n\n....
