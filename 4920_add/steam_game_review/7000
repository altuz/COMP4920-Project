Crystal Dynamics managed to strike a great balance of moden tendencies of gaming (even the ones I don't appreciate, like QTEs, but thankfully, they don't happen very often) and the platforming, acrobatic, risk-of-falling-to-your-death-at-every-moment wholesome goodness. And what I really, really enjoyed? Actual TOMB RAIDING! I really enjoyed and liked all the levels, but King Arthur's tomb ... man, that level was the bee's knees - I loved every minute of it! \nSo what holds this game from being perfect? Well, apart from the QTEs I already mentioned, I'd point out wobbly, awkward controls which I didn't really like. They're far from being useless and frustrating, but not nearly perfect either. Also, the characters and the story didn't really grab me at all; the story especially seemed a bit half-baked to me, which is a shame - I always loved the stories in Tomb Raider games. \nAnother negative thing would be very easy puzzles and boss fights. The game is generally pretty easy, but the puzzles and boss fights were just way too easy. I played the game on the normal difficulty, so maybe I'll try it on hard, but seriously, normal difficulty is really way too easy.\nAs far as characters go, they were very, very unremarkable, including both the goodies and the baddies. Oh well, at least Lara was portrayed well. I really enjoyed her voice actress, too - she has a very nice, agreeable voice that really suits Lara very well. I also loved how angry Lara got at the end of the game, you don't see that very often. \nAll in all, even in spite of these flaws, this is a fine reboot of a legendary franchise, and a solid, solid game. A few shortcomings, but a whole lot of goodness. I appreciate Crystal Dynamics' success in fusing modern game sensibilities with the classic Tomb Raider attributes we old school TR fans know and love. Legend is definitely a worthy volume in this legendary franchise, and a fine example of how reboots should be made."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506284093, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35189968", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198060817953", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1506283974, "num_games_owned": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "playtime_forever": 719}, "timestamp_updated": 1506284093, "received_for_free": false, "review": "My first Tomb Raider game after many years of just avoiding the series... \nGreat job Crystal Dynamics! \n\nApart from a few bugs with the \"New Content\" , I found the game great!\n\n- interesting story\n- distinct and memorable levels \n- funny puzzles and bosses\n\nAnd most of all - great vista to gaze upon while making Lara sweat on those ledges!\n\n5/5 would recommend (and don't forget the New Content = OFF on the winter levels) :)"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506691692, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498993", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35294283", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198325254200", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1507025682, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 375, "playtime_forever": 375}, "timestamp_updated": 1506691692, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very fun plus,  why is Lara so hot???"}]}
