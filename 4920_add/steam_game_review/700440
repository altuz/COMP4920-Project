The controls are non-existent, you have to figure out how they work. It's also mega buggy, Dont go near the edge of the screen because you will be stuck there, The aim of the game isn't clear either. This is clearly a game made by art students who didn't properly consider the \"game\" aspect of \"videogame\". I very much appreciate the idea of recreating the life cycle of a jelly fish, and it looks excellent. However, I really feel it needed some explananation at each point. For example when I become a polup perhaps some explanation of what that stage involves and why I am gathering random green stuff from random nearby blue stuff and then feeding it to random nearby yellow stuff would be helpful in learning about the jellyfish lifecycle.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505520393, "timestamp_created": 1505520393, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198026984577", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 146, "last_played": 1505519980, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35040669", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487977", "review": "No Options.  No controls shown except a message at the beginning to use W, A, S, D to move.\n\nHowever, only A and D work to move you left and right to collect bubbles.  You cannot move up and down and just randomly for no ryhme or reason you'll pop up or down with zero control over this.  The description also says use WASD to control your creature and you are able to move freely.  NOT the case at all!  I've re-started this game three times and the controls never did work, and pressing every key on my keyboard, mouse whell and both mouse buttons did nothing.  There is NO logical reason for moving up or down, and ZERO control over being able to freakin' move.  ARGHHH!\n\nFrustrating as hell.  Super AWKWARD.  There's a TIP but it just says \"Don't fall\".
