There are no special cutscenes, no crazy graphics, no marshmellows, no prize inside. If you want a basic defense game without the excess then this is the game for you. Its easy to pick up, play, and understand while still providing a challenge.\n\nWhat may be bothersome is the fact that you have to be surprisingly dead on with the placement of your die to level up. You may THINK that you're dead on only to have the die reset itself back to its original position; a huge problem when you're in the middle of life and death heated play. Another bothersome issue is that you must place a die on the board first before you can place it on another to level up. Again, this is only an issue when heated play is involved as it can lead to shaky mouse movement which leads to inaccurate die placement causing you to lose precious time.\n\nI looked up basic tower defense game on steam and this popped up. I'm satisifed with the finished product and its only a buck. If you can appreciate simplicity and substance over style in you defense games, then add this game to your collection.

Some tower placements are closer to the enemy circuit than others, leading me to believe that I'm supposed to place close-range tower types there, but they all seem to have the same range.\n\nIt's as if someone tried to make a copy of an intuitive tower defense game and got it half right. It crashes, the music is almost bearable, but for its low price I can't give it a negative review.

There's basically no gameplay at all.
