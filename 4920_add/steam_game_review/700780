Artwork graphics look nice, the audio is appropriate for its genre, and the movement system has a nice feel (aside from the jump being a bit tight). Worth the price, but definitely foreseeing some polishing in certain aspects of the game. Very bareboned arena shooter at the moment. It'll need some work for newer versions of the game.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Scratches arena itch on its most basic level.\n- Pretty immersive atmosphere.\n- Fast paced running and gunning. (AR is loads of fun)\n- Decent variety of enemies and levels for a barebone early access.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n- Feels rather overwhelming and no sense of \"overcoming\" enemies.\n- It's difficult to strategize; as the monster spawning feels a bit too random.\n- Explosions throw you too far.\n\nOther things to point out:\n- The game is difficult (likely intentionally), as soon as you dive in, it's a constant battle of slowly approaching enemies until you die. I personally like the difficulty, but the randomness is a little too rough.. Every game should have a moment where you've felt like you've triumpth a certain degree here and there.\n- Hoping to see a configuration menu soon! Would love to tweak audio levels and motion blur effect to my liking.\n- There's an exploit where monsters have an extremely difficult time reaching you on the weapon platform on the last level. Also, achievements are very wonky.\n\nBut hey! This is about the same price as a cup of coffee, and if you wanna kill 1, 2, or more hours; this is a great way to do it. It's a charming game for its price, and actually pretty fun if you take it for what it is.\n\n", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505811501, "timestamp_created": 1505811501, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198148663981", "num_reviews": 4, "num_games_owned": 16, "last_played": 1505982544, "playtime_forever": 109}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34986994", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501787", "review": "Obviously the game is not yet in its final state, there are a couple of bugs that I recognised and the balancing has still room for improvement. \n\nHowever, the game itself is fun and doesn't get old as the game has several different levels with different enemies and difficulties.
