There are a few problems with it though:\n\n>No widescreen support --- need to use mods to get widescreen and to increase fov, where the hud will still stay at 4:3, and even then you will see pop-in around the edges of your screen because the game was never meant for either of those.\n\n>No more multiplayer\n\n>Some sounds didn't play during certain parts of the game/cutsceens\n\n>very few video options other that what you get from the standalone customization tool that you can choose to launch instead when you run the game.\n\nOther than that I think it's a good game overall.

In especially cutscenes the screen gets very hazy and it becomes very hard to see, however scoping in with the sniper gets rid of it... so you can run around aimlessly looking down the scope to see stuff\n-Randomly crashes, happened about 3-4 times and not sure how it happened\n-Augmentations are all useless except for Ballistic Shield as it is OP AF, basically you become a god\n-Trying to be stealthy is usually pointless as the Cloak is too short and there's no real need to be stealthy as long as you have ammo\n-Although there is a good variety of weapons, there's almost no variety in the enemies or objectives that you encounter, thus rendering the weapon selection pointless. Each weapon is just another gun with a different kind of ammo instead of another tool for a different use \n\n[h1]TL:DR[/h1]\n[i]Super soldier and every cliche out of an action movie plus a futuristic setting.[/i]\n\n[h1]The Truthful Hard Facts[/h1]\n[table]\n[tr][td]Acquirement Method[/td][th]Steam Store[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Price Paid[/td][th]$0.99[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Length[/td][th]5-8 hours[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Rig Used[/td][th][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thisgrouplinkwasavailable/discussions/0/1473095331487872526/]Main Computer[/url][/th][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]The Elaborate and Perplexing Scoring System[/h1]\n10.
