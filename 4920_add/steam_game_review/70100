Eventually I reached for the money cheat and maxed out my hardware at Square One, and a few missions in, I was still barely 'breaking even' financially.  Is that supposed to be some kind of meta-joke on the plight of the White Hat?  Who knows.... Still, this game (as well as HACKNET) I found to be a compelling 'crash course' in the Linux command-line interface.  Not thorough by any stretch, but I found this a lot easier to follow than any 'officially sanctioned training' I've ever endured on the subject."}]}
