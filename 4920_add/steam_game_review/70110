Getting that out of the way I only recommend this game if you like:\n\n[olist]\n    [*]Command Prompt Games\n    [*]Challenging puzzles\n    [*]Figuring out the story through context\n    [*]Repeating the same puzzle multiple times\n    [*]Linear game play with minmal margin for error\n[/olist]\n\nNot sure what the creator of the game was thinking, probablly wanted to push out another version of the original, but this one is easier IMO. The first one had many stopping points as the clues were not as intuitive as in this version, but this version is very linear in nature. The first one allowed you to make upgrades to you machine early on without sacraficing parts for trace cash. If you make two or more mistakes with finding your servers, you might have to sell your upgrades or completely fail.\n\nMy only complaint is that I couldn't upgrade my machine like I did in the first one, and had to just stick with firewall level 1. I did enjoy the chanllenge of the game overall, but it's not everyones cup of tea.\n\nNote: Edits made only for typos."}]}
