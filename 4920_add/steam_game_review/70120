But it is definitely showing its age and I'm not averse to trying something new. On the face of it, Hacker Evolution Duality looks to be an excellent successor to that beloved classic. But first appearances are frequently misleading.\n\nHacker is not a game; it is a collection of dull and fiddly mini-games. While it has an excellent presentation, the gameplay itself is nothing more than pushing a button at the right time; an uninteresting race against the clock that you need to repeat dozens of times in each mission. It looks great - it has the appearance of Hollywood hacking nailed - but it quickly degenerates into uninteresting repetitiveness. And just to make things even less fun, the controls were stiff and unresponsive; just the thing for a game that demands quick reflexes. Despite its stylish gloss, the game fails to engage on almost every other levels and ultimately is not particularly fun."}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385598710, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612012", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "7796375", "votes_up": 96, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198028652973", "num_reviews": 14, "last_played": 1345100400, "num_games_owned": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 64}, "timestamp_updated": 1385598710, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I played the first Hacker Evolution and I loved it.

There's a dude that posted some workaround with converting mp3 files to ogg and changing some text files around to make it work, this way you can actually read mission objectives.\n\nThe game it is kind of crap, it is not very intuitive what you need to do, in fact in the tutorial the AI hacked me down to 0 firewall and 0 integrity and I had no idea what would I need to do to counter it.
