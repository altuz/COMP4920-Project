While the story is as engaging as the first half and the art is beautiful, I cannot help but be slightly... annoyed with the ending.\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure if it was a good ending or not... [spoiler]Sure the four girls survive and can pursue their love... but the evil organization behind it all now rules the world. Makes me wonder if there is another part to come where that gets taken care of.[/spoiler]\n\nStill, it is a good read. However, do get Part 1 first.\n\nAnd there might be a patch for more... explicit content, but I don't know what it would add.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507031876, "timestamp_created": 1507031876, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_reviews": 362, "num_games_owned": 445, "last_played": 1507031518, "playtime_forever": 80}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
