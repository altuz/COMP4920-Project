If you are looking for a challenge, skip this game because it is very easy to finish all of the 12 levels available. For achievementhunters i would say, yes, get this game. \n\nJust to give a guick overlook. The game has decent visuals, cute little levels, the controls are fine and the soundtrack fits the game. But for the price you only get 12 levels which makes this game feel more like a schoolproject.", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504889272, "timestamp_created": 1504889272, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198139756861", "num_reviews": 11, "num_games_owned": 270, "last_played": 1504862427, "playtime_forever": 14}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
