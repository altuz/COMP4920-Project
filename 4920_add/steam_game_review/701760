It also has a basic leveling system where you can upgrade things like your health, armor, ammo and sprint ability. The graphics are okay, rather simple, but it does run incredibly smoothly as a result - even with a large horde of zombies chasing after you. With future updates I really think this could turn into a great game, although with that said, even in its current state I think it's easily worth the \u20ac0,99.
