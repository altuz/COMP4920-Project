The current version of this game offers an incredibly short campaign, one multiplayer map and a slew of problems that makes the experience frustrating. Everything from the menu mapping to the poorly scripted nature of the campaign impacts the meager offerings available at present. The core shooting at least functions in terms of pointing and shooting, and the graphics, albeit minimalistic, were passable. \n\nThe issues begin to seep through at the menu screen, which is preceded by the language select screen. Anytime you exit any part of the game, it defaults to the language screen instead of the menu. Options are not as big of a concern in most cases, but the only options are from the default pre-launch resolution changes, the options menu\u2019s graphics selection, and a sensitivity slider. This leads to the game\u2019s first major grip: sound. Starting up the single player, you are greeting with deafening music that disappears during the game\u2019s first cutscene. Thankfully, you can access the in-game menu at this point and adjust the volume, which is a must due to the extremely loud gunfire, walking sound effect and explosions. \n\nSingle player comprises of a cutscene, a scripted sniper section, another cutscene, a free range shoot out with enemies, then concluded by another cutscene. I managed to get through all of this in a little over four minutes, but this was not achieved in the video provided. I did run into an issue with the sniper section not returning control to the sniper after the second shot, yet it rolled straight into the second cutscene. Upon reaching the beach, I noticed the AI specialized in the conga as they marched forward, single file, to receive a bullet from the enemy who also proceeded in single file (reinforcements did I mean). Should you die during any portion of the campaign, you will be forced to continue from the beginning.\n\nOn the multiplayer front, I managed to find a game with two people in it and spawned in with no issues. As soon as I saw someone, however, I noticed their model was distorted and shook as they moved. Following a death, I managed to go on a massive killing spree with their models spawning behind me, on top of each other, clipping into objects and otherwise moving as if they couldn\u2019t see me. It was made worse by possible hit-box detection issues that made it seem as if half my shots went through them or hit them when I wasn\u2019t even aiming at the body. Regardless, the match seemed to keep going and I promptly left the match \n\nOne other annoying issue I noticed made it impossible to click on anything with the mouse. I would either be in the menu or on the campaign screen and notice the mouse cursor was missing. Exiting the screen seems to fix the issue, but it was enough to require me to exit the application using the Task Manager at one point. It is just one problem among a cluster of smaller bugs inevitably bringing the current build to its\u2019 feet. It is why I can\u2019t recommend this project at the moment  even at the sales price.  \n\nThis has been a EAW PSA.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505798774, "timestamp_created": 1505798774, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198000561257", "num_reviews": 87, "num_games_owned": 2901, "last_played": 1505772947, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 12, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35209045", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "review": "The game isn't even half baked, it is more of a quarter baked, no particular reason to pick it up.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506367264, "timestamp_created": 1506367264, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "steamid": "76561198052341203", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 35, "last_played": 1506367142, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 7, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35078425", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503206", "review": "The gameplay is bad \nThe Game Doesnt Even Have A Long Story Mode Its L\u0131ke 5 Min Or Less Gameplay\nNone Plays It\nThe Zombie DLC is PAID which is none sense why would i pay for a new shitty game mode and i even got banned just cuz i wrote something to the discussion \n\nCONGRATS YOU CANNOT EVEN TAKE A BAD REVIEW CANT YOU\n\n1/10 WORST EXPERIENCE I HAD", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506520081, "timestamp_created": 1505887513, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "steamid": "76561198198802054", "num_reviews": 22, "num_games_owned": 183, "last_played": 1506171998, "playtime_forever": 33}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35051753", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502240", "review": "The dev blackmailed me into giving his game a good review in exchange for a Nuclear Shot update that was actually a lie.", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505943199, "timestamp_created": 1505763405, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 252, "steamid": "76561198042583978", "num_reviews": 27, "num_games_owned": 106, "last_played": 1507148937, "playtime_forever": 661}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35186175", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "review": "dont play", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506273128, "timestamp_created": 1506273128, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "steamid": "76561198062103911", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 78, "last_played": 1506273056, "playtime_forever": 10}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35255589", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "Please save 2 dollars", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506578304, "timestamp_created": 1506578304, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "steamid": "76561198067495136", "num_reviews": 37, "num_games_owned": 73, "last_played": 1506578155, "playtime_forever": 13}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35051735", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "review": "Trash heap of a game.
