You play as one of the people trapped on the Witch's Isle and have to save yourself from a certain death. As you talk to people around the town you will be able to see through their eyes which may give you a solution to the puzzle. I have never seen a mechanic like that in this genre and it adds a really great depth to puzzles. Aside from few visual glitches, it is a very enjoyable and immersive experience. If you like adventure games, $3 is the insulting price for this amount of effort.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the game is the neat perspective. Basically, the game is 2D but you can explore the town by going into background or foreground. Which is really neat because you can still see previous area, giving it visual depth. There are some problems with foreground blinding you though. Perhaps developer should have implemented a see-through feature. I have not seen this idea done before to this extent and honestly, I am really digging it. The pixel art is pretty great and it has surprisingly high attention to detail. Some people even have event cycles like doing work and going back home. \n\n[u] You actually have a time limit to beat the game.[/u] Honestly, it was not that much of a problem and you get 2 save slots. Although it is very weird when adventure game makes you rush ( this genre is for casuals am I right ;). The controls are pretty sufficient and I especially like the intuitive inventory. If you forget who people in town are you can always look them up in inventory and read about them. There are several clues in conversations so you have to keep track of what people do. Sometimes you have to spy on people and see where they go (that may unlock a new event)\n\nThere are 7 endings which should take you around 5 hours to discover (about 4 of them are kind of dead ends). I found the story very motivating in a mysterious way. Also, the plot twist was very enjoyable, it was pretty obvious but I still did not see it coming. The game just gave me a really good closure after the true ending. I was really interested in reading dialogue although it felt a little dry probably do to translation. At least the game was very straightforward with text clues.\n\nI do like that game takes time to create emotional scenes. Some moments don't really have anything to do with the plot but they help to create the atmosphere. On the Isle, there are many unique individuals that do different things and have different opinions about the witch. It gave me enough context to care about the characters that I was saving. I actually bought this game based on soundtrack alone, needless to say, I like the ambient score here.\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts: 8/10 [/h1]\n\nThe Witch's Isle is unlike any other point&click adventure game that I played. Being able to spy on any human or animal in town is such a fantastic puzzle mechanic. Trying to figure out ending triggers and achievements was lots of fun. It seems to be a very well designed experience, just needs some polishing with those visual glitches.I think developer really put his heart into this project and at $3 you can't go wrong. It is a very creative game and I highly recommend it.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505527383, "timestamp_created": 1505455538, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197995669628", "num_reviews": 97, "num_games_owned": 597, "last_played": 1505695821, "playtime_forever": 475}, "votes_up": 14, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34973385", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509750", "review": "The Witch's Isle is a Point and Click Adventure game with a time limit. \n\nYou can find a bit over 15 minutes of gameplay with commentary here:\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7FdQX3tR1w] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7FdQX3tR1w [/url] \n\nYou play as an unnamed character, on an island with other unnamed people who have all had their memories wiped by the Witch that lives at the top of the island. The game starts with your character being cursed by the Witch, and tasked to retrieve her urn before 4am (game time) or die to the curse.\n\nMovement it just mouse control, with left click to move or interact with people, items and doors. Each person you meet is recorded in the games log book, and at any time you can focus that person on the island to see what they are doing.\n\nThe art style is 8bit, which I enjoy - but as the environment overlaps, sometimes I found it problematic to click where I wanted to move as a front layer was in the way. In this case I believe I was trying to get to an area I couldn't get too. I also enjoyed the games ambient music.\n\nThe unique feature of this game is the ability to look in on any character you meet. You use this to help figure out how to discover more about the islands curse and how to break it.\n\nI feel the game is great value for $2.99 and am happy to recommend it to anyone who enjoys a Point and Click style of game.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505486644, "timestamp_created": 1505486021, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197960286303", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 130, "last_played": 1505641490, "playtime_forever": 77}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35036023", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500565", "review": "A definitely very unique game, both in artwork and story and partially as well in gameplay.\nSeemingly a point-and-click adventure, you are given a few in-game hours to find out the secrets about the island and unlock one of the different endings (or not, which is also an ending). At the beginning it exists of mostly walking around and talking to the people, then some introduction of puzzles that want you to combine items and use them at the right places up to some more interesting features like following certain village members via some kind of overwatch system and unlocking hints with knowledge. It is pretty simple and linear, but sometimes the puzzles can be 'locked' behind of a time window or need several attempts before unlocking, at least in my experience. This is later remedied with a fast-forward system a bit, and usually there is also a hint system in place which should give you one tip if you want it every five minutes, but this is sadly bugged as it seems and so I had to solve the game without it.\n\nThat said, there are multiple endings, which are mostly dependant on how far you got before you decided to go to the witch. Once done, or you failed, you can retry the game again where the hints, people targets and such are saved though. Thankfully there is a save-system, so you don't have to get together everything everytime just to try a different ending. I didn't unlock all of them yet, but they all tie in very well with the story and they play really well on the mystery atmosphere. A big point of the game is to try and get all the achievements (which are mostly the different endings) as well as a kind of mystery to solve. It works for me.\n\nTalking of, the story and tone of the game is pretty great, it feels like a very unique setting and an almost romatized story that though might still surprise, it definitely gives one the urge to find out more.\nThe graphic is in parts really beautiful pixelart (reminds me a lot of Sword and Sworcery) with good animations. Soundtrack is not extensive but plays well to the tone of the game and underlines the mood.\n\nFew issues I have to complain about are the abovementioned hint issue, one or two times I had a graphical issue with the background and that some areas or usables seem to not show the markant arrow at all or it needs some time till they show up with no seemingly valid reason. That means that for some parts you need to revisit stuff and just click on things again, cause maybe they might work now. But all in all I definitely enjoyed this game a lot, it has superb atmosphere and is something that might stay in your mind, and for that low of a price I can only but recommend it to everyone!", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505694871, "timestamp_created": 1505694871, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993996349", "num_reviews": 40, "num_games_owned": 710, "last_played": 1505860679, "playtime_forever": 285}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35033356", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477592", "review": "Just put in my refund request for this game. While the game is good looking, a number of design decisions and persistant issues mean that I would strongly reccomend against buying this game, until the dev puts more time in to fixing the issues.\n-------\nDocumented below are the bugs I encountered during gameplay:\n\n-Current map section turned entirely black, though background and foreground maintained colour - required game restart to resolve.\n\n-Save feature locked out entirely during my second attempt - resolved by abandoning that attempt and restarting the day.\n\n-Game's state save/progress save failed, and undid my progress during an attempt while resolving other issues.\n\n-Hint feature bugged out, giving me a 1525 year wait real time before I would be able to use my first hint - persisted through game restarts, starting new saves, wiping out local files, repairing the game files, uninstalling and reinstalling, and changing my system date/time format. EDIT - This bug, apparently, has been fixed by the developer in a patch since I have refunded.\n-------\nDocumented below are the gameplay/input issues I encountered:\n\n-Clicking on areas to interact frequently did the wrong thing (moving up/down a zone instead of talking, noting a door is locked or closed instead of moving).\n\n-Many areas that look like you should be able to move through them are actually static objects, or do not allow you to interact with them until reaching a specific story trigger. This includes almost every object you can pick up, and most of the ladders - you aren't allowed to touch them at all until a specific story trigger, and then you are allowed to, with no specific reasoning as to what changed. \n\n-Some areas that look traversable are not, for no explained reason - there may be another story trigger later that I had not activated yet that let you move across these open areas, but I found a number of areas that looked like I should be able to move through them were inexplicably not valid areas to move to.\n-------\nThe last bug I encountered was a major problem, as the puzzles required interacting with specific objects or finding locations that do not show up by default - it seems the game was designed with the existance of the hint option in mind, as my first hour of gameplay was spent trying to find out what to do after finding the theif - the third step in the game.", "votes_down": 11, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505842978, "timestamp_created": 1505683049, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198016887383", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 154, "last_played": 1505681919, "playtime_forever": 111}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
