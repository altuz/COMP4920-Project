I don't know if it's my bad luck, but this game is rigged.  Like...for some reason the A.I wins 95% of the time EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Now, don't quote me on the 95% win rate because I haven't done any statistics to back up that percentage but still, this game is very frustrating.  My last game before I unoffically uninstalled this game was as followed.  Dialogue is edited to remove any cussing :)\n\n*Dealer hands out cards.  I'm the BB (Big Blind) and A.I is SB (Small Blind).  Gets two Aces, knows immediately he will win.  Bets are put on table.  Both the A.I and I call.  The flop happens.  It was a 3, 7, and some other card, I forget.\n\nMe: OMG, two Aces, this is the best pair and the flop are all low cards.  I will win for sure!\n\n*A.I raises and I raise back.  The turn happens.  Still no good cards.  A.I raises again...\n\nMe: OMG, LMAO, I'm going to win.  I'm going to raise the A.I's raise.\n\n*Pot amount is huge, A.I goes all in and so do I.  River occurs.\n\nMe: I won for sure.  This is awesome.\n\n*Card reveals happen.  A.I has a 3 and a 7 and wins with a two pair against my one pair of aces.  *insert WTF image here.  Rage quits, uninstalls the game, and begins writing this review...\n\nNo but for real, the game is great, but the A.I is sooooo BS!"}]}
