It is broken as all can be though. Somehow launching it the first time actually crashed steam... go figure.\n\nThen the game was making my computer scream in pain. I have i7, gtx1080. 32gb ram but something in the way they coded it was seriously stressing my rig into making noise. Whiny fan or HDD spin noise. It is like an android level graphics game so.... yeah.\n\nAny time you press \"esc\" like to try to go to a menu? No, that closes the game completely. Like quits.\n\nFinally, during only my second city capture fight, the characters just stopped moving. Frozen in place. Spells still worked, but the game completely forgot it was supposed to be working correctly.\n\nAll of this happened in the first 2 minutes. I had to fire the game back up and pray it ran a full five minutes and didn\u2019t brick my machine just so I could write this review and save you from making the mistake of buying this.\n\nRefund. However, I would consider rebuying if they ever made the darn thing even remotely playable.\n", "votes_down": 10, "language": "english", "comment_count": "7", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507117096, "timestamp_created": 1507117096, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561198067851126", "num_reviews": 93, "num_games_owned": 664, "last_played": 1507117082, "playtime_forever": 6}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
