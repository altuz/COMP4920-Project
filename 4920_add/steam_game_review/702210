The clothing damage that displays on your character's paperdoll is a nice touch.  Also, it was a nice nod to RPG tradition that many cabinets and dressers have items you can take.\n\nThe game itself feels like a slog right from the beginning.  It reminded me of the old scool RPGs that weren't fun, where even the first battles would take a long time, and you had to grind just to have any chance of keeping up,  Couple this with art that's not impressive, as well as text formatting errors that render what's already a poor translation literally unreadable in many panels, and there's not much to enjoy about this game.  Additionally, the H material being shoved in (not just a figure of speech) right at the outset both takes away the element of player choice and makes the idea of the main character being a chosen one heroine seem completely absurd.

Positives, I guess?\nIt doesn't take long for the game to get to porn. That's it.\n\nThis is arguably the worst Dieselmine release yet. Text is machine translated, what do you expect at this point?\nBut the translation is not simply bad, the lines commonly overflow, so that you'll only see beginning of the text before everything disappears outside the screen. That is especially common problem with the item descriptions, often you'll only see the ending of the equipment descriptions.\nThe game also crashes on some sex-scenes while you're playing in English. But I didn't notice that happen in any mandatory ones, so I guess that is a plus...?\n\nAs far as content goes, I'm not a fan. Serena's design isn't very appealing, and she seems to be commonly drawn off-model in sex-scenes. Meia is fun, but she gets the minority of the different scenes, as does Astarotte.\nThe way you get sex-scenes is by either having right equipment on and talking to NPC in town, or losing against an area boss. Either way, the scenes are pretty rapey. I guess if you're into it they'd be appealing, but the translation combined with overflowing text either makes them mildly amusing, or very frustrating to try and understand.\nAside from that, you have very average RPG Maker product.
