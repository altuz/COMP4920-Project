I mean out of ten, I'd probably give it a five.  But it's getting a thumbs down for a few reasons.\n\nThe good:\nVery pretty graphics\nUnusual play mechanics (more on this later)\n\nThe bad:\nVERY click intensive \nLimited settings changes \nNo tutorial \nFrustrating 'bonuses'\n\nI liked the unusual game mechanics here for about the first five minutes.  Everything was bright and brilliantly spinny.  However, as I found this game under the 'idle' tag, I thought it would involve a little less hands on game-play and a little more incremental balancing.  Really, this is probably more a taste thing than anything, but I didn't expect the game to be a clicker and only a clicker.  And where everything else was acceptible enough, the 'bonuses' were what made me quit after 20 minutes.  Having to drag and drop on top of having to click many different things all over the screen was just not something my wrists and I were appreciating.\n\nThis is not a bad game, but it's probably not one I'll be playing again in the near future.\n\n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506221154, "timestamp_created": 1506221154, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "steamid": "76561198225073792", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 29, "last_played": 1506175791, "playtime_forever": 30}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35151889", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483106", "review": "[h1]SPINNER[/h1]\nAnother game for my spinner [strike]collection[/strike] addiction.", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506168721, "timestamp_created": 1506168721, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "steamid": "76561198215816717", "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 172, "last_played": 1506279494, "playtime_forever": 79}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
