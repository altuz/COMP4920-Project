This game is hard, and that's kinda the appeal: refining your skills at a truly difficult platform game. The lack of jumping is surprisingly OK to deal with, but it takes a while before you really get it and you stop trying to jump of somewhere, only to launch somewhere completely different. You'll die a lot, but that's fine. You can instantly try again and just keep going."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505380515, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34945067", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198251196836", "num_reviews": 11, "last_played": 1454404569, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 96}, "timestamp_updated": 1505380515, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Lugia approved software."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506247657, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35176485", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198113180610", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506247415, "num_games_owned": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 273, "playtime_forever": 431}, "timestamp_updated": 1506247657, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Ahhh, soundtracks =3"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504659266, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34767274", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198271982086", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1504970147, "num_games_owned": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 251}, "timestamp_updated": 1504659266, "received_for_free": false, "review": "One of the best games I've ever played. Spent countless hours on 3DS, and have played through at least 20 times.\n\nGood for speedrunning, has a rediculous amount of replayablility (trinkets, death count challenges, gravitron, secret lab) and is overall just amazing.\n\nSountrack is godlike as well, and always worth a listen.\n\n9.5/10 from me."}]}
