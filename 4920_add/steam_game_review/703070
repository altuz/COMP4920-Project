The game offers a simple setup for a gamer to start playing right away, the game music is fun, and the game doesn't take itself too seriously. It is exactly what you'd expect. That having been said, this game is perfect for kids 8+ looking to play a game for Halloween that's not too scary.\n\nPremise of the game: Pick car, drive car (with arrow keys), run over toonish zombies. The goal is to kill the most zombies you can before your car's health completely wears down.\n\nAgain, the game isn't bad.
