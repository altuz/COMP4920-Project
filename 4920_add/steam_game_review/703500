Despite what some people think, it isn't a clone of anything. Expect 3 to 6h to complete. Direct improvement of first ReThink game.\n\n\n\nLong version:\nFor starters, I'll say I'm used to First Person Puzzle games, I like this genre. I completed Portal, Talos Principle, Magnetic Cage Closed, QUBE, Antichamber, and others, including ReThink (the previous game).\n\n\nNow, the review:\nReThink | Evolved is, basically, a direct improvement of ReThink, as the name suggested it.\n\nCore mechanic: you place various cubes freely (instead of on a grid-like structure for the previous game) to redirect colored lasers from their source to colored end points. Several types of cubes are there, from the basic \"straight that way\" to \"split the colors\", \"source cubes\" and a few others. In later tests, \"shieldbridges\" (toggleable bridges) will add some difficulty. Later again, you'll have to think the puzzles in 3D.\nIf you didn't like the floor-tiles puzzles from the first game, there are still a few in this one, but waaaaay less.\nAbout the plot, \"you have to do puzzles for some reason\". Don't expect more than that. Not a problem, this game doesn't pretend to do more.\n\nNow, pros and cons (at the time I'm writing this):\nPros:\n- Solid core mechanic with various elements, keeps it interesting to the end.\n- Annoying mechanics from the previous game are either removed or improved.\n- quite long game, and sometimes you have to choose your path (two different sets of puzzles, happens 3 times). Expect 3 to 6 hours to complete it the first time, based on your experience with FPP games.\n- Smooth difficulty curve.\n- A working fidget spinner. Because reasons.\n- Beautiful graphics.\n- Beautiful non intrusive ambient music and sounds.\n- Several options, especially for an indie game. Amongst others: FOV slider, detailed performance settings, rebindable keys.\n- Currently available in 4 languages, only through texts (English, German, French and Swedish).\n- Active developper, will fix small bugs within hours at most.\n\nCons:\n- The fidget spinner falls on the ground when you take a cube, so you might lose it if you're not careful.\n- No real plot, but that's not a real problem.\n\n\nNow, is this game a clone of [other game]? (I remind you I know those games very well.)\n- Compared to Portal:\n - White walls: as any overly clean building, like labs, hospitals, some companies... Basic design.\n - Lasers and cubes: Portal only has one type of cube with one color. There are more here, it's a direct improvement of Portal.\n - Jumping pads: basic gameplay elements since the dawn of FPS games.\n - Emancipation grids: basic gameplay element in many FPP games.\n - Light bridges: agreed, for the concept. But it was either that or bring back the annoying cubes from the first game. Would be a shame.\n - No-gravity areas: Portal funnels and the areas in this game are completely different.\n - Portals: there isn't any here.\n\n- Compared to Talos Principle:\n - Blue and red lasers: in Talos, lasers collide. They. Collide. If you still think this game is a clone, I feel sorry for you.\n\n\nRandom rant:\n- Your opinion is irrelevant, the dev is in your friend list!\nBecause I asked for rebindable keys in the first ReThink game, testing was easier with a direct conversation. Why would I delete friendly and helpful people from my friend list?\nMy opinion of this game isn't biased. I bought the game, played it blindly, and genuinely liked it.\n\n\nNow, it's up to you. Want to buy it? Go ahead! Don't want to? Then don't.
