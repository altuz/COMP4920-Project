Control and gameplay however, is another story.  I played with a controller and the only bit I used were the direction pad and the A to shoot.  There's no special attacks, the power-ups that get dropped were sorta \"meh\", and the game doesn't feel all that challenging.  \n\nA few things worth noting:\n1) The nudity isn't really nudity.  The girls' bodies, once exposed, don't show nipples or pubic hair (think Barbie dolls).  So if you're looking for some T&A, look elsewhere - cuz there ain't none here.\n2) You are free to go ANYWHERE on the screen.  You can fly all the way to the girl's face and then drop back down to her feet again.  So you DO get to see the girl's face, but you have to fly up to it to see it.\n\nEven though you can't expect much for a dollar these days, I can't really call Space girls a MUST HAVE game.  If you're looking to build your libarary with cheap games, get it.  But if you're looking for a good schmup/bullet hell - Space Gals will not be able to scatch that itch for you.\n\n(Yes, I know I overturned my own recommendation but if you can't recommend a game - dont)[/b]", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507064164, "timestamp_created": 1506998497, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "steamid": "76561198032072517", "num_reviews": 25, "num_games_owned": 1740, "last_played": 1506997447, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35455195", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "review": "Far, far too slow gameplay for a space shooter with no real difficulty curve across the levels.
