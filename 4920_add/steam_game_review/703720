It is not a particularly punishing game because it has an abundance of checkpoints. You can totally enjoy it casually but the last stage requires at least a C rank in previous stages to access. About 80 percent of the features like extra modes require you to speedrun certain parts to unlock. So you do need at least some level of competent reflexes to get the full experience. As you can see I dropped 24+ hours into the game and I still have things to do. There are 3 regular modes that change mechanics, journey mode, and infinite mode. If you like that kind of gameplay where you have to learn the layout of the level it has a lot of replay value. As far as music and aesthetic part go I absolutely love it. I think for some $9 may seem a lot of a speedrun game but the price is well justified with content.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe game is focused on speedruns and each stage times your playthrough. When you die it simply adds 20 seconds to your time and puts you maybe 10 seconds back at most. You can even buy hit points at a cost of 2 seconds per charge. The controls feel very fluid and easy to pick up. I just love the how mobile the character is with 3 charges of the dash which you can use in air, on the ground or while sliding. To attack you just repeatedly ram into things as many times as dash can allow which is extremely satisfying. Unlike most similar games there is a health bar. Not instantly dying to everything is nice although the game makes up for it with an absurd amount of things that can hit you. Most of the boss fights are unique and very well made (most). Pretty much like any wall jumping game you ever played but very refined if that makes sense.\n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\n\nErsatz has some of the best use of sound effects and music. Each time you move into a new room the soundtrack gets another lair. Certain enemies have attack timed to the score so they actually create a beat for the music (seems intentional).The soundtrack is very dynamic and does not feel like an afterthought loop. So many sound effects like huge explosions that make me think of Atari. Man, I even enjoy just clicking around the menu. I could not compliment the audio in this game enough, it is just awesome.\n\n[h1] Aesthetic [/h1]\n\nIt looks simple but I can tell there is a lot of effort went into making this. I am not just talking about backgrounds, there are so many cool visuals effects from character or screen transitions. Those explosions after killing bosses.... Another Atari nostalgia vibe. Each level has a different theme going on with unique stage mechanics. It is kinda hard to react to projectiles though because there is just so much going on visually. Just a very well presented game.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n+ Dynamic platforming\n+ Smooth controls\n+ Fantastic Music/Sound effects\n+ Good pace & friendly checkpoints\n+ Lots of stage mechancis\n+ Good level variety\n+ Challenging but fair difficulty\n+ Very appealing visually\n+ Decent replay value\n\n[b] Cons:  [/b]\n\n- Kind of hard to see things because of constant effects and color choices.\n- Few hitbox problems with bosses\n- Achievements could be a little more forgiving. You get 1 and the rest are like uber level hard.\n\n[h1] Final Thought: 9/10 [/h1]\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is the best game I ever played in this hardcore platformer format. There are so many games that repeat the same old formula with minimum effort. Someone actually put a lot of effort into this one, how refreshing. If you like this kind of games based on repetition,speedrun and learning the layout of the level give it a try.

It does achieve what it claims to.\n\n\n[h1]Art:[/h1]\nThe art is minimalist but not in the \"programmer art\" way. I think most of the art is quite good looking, with most of the appeal coming from the stark colour contrasts and polygonal shapes. I think some of the early game art (such as in level 1) are fairly low quality compared to the rest of the game, but by no means is the early art bad. Personally I think the style is quite unique and attractive *most* of the time. There can be issues with being able to see though rare, but I have terrible eyesight so who knows YMMV.\n\n\n[h1]Music and Sound Effects:[/h1]\nThe music is very varied in genre, and whilst some tracks are weaker (usually the earlier levels again. I think you can tell the developer improved over development in almost all areas, because the design also improves later on; though that may have to do with extended freedom in terms of difficulty). The music is written in what appears to be layers, with different layers and sections programmatically unlocking as the level progresses so you'll struggle to get bored of the music.\n\nBandcamp link for those who want to have a listen: \nhttps://parisstalker.bandcamp.com/releases.\n\n\n[h1]Programming/System:[/h1]\nThe game generally runs extremely well (on release there were some issues with performance but they have since been ironed out; at least for me). The options are a tad empty, but there's about enough there to do what you'd want. More exact resolution selection would've been cool but the multiples (e.g. 2x, 4x initial resolution) used are no gamebreaker as the game supports fullscreen well. The camera usually works very well, with only a few rare exceptions most of which have been fixed since release. There were a few immediate bugs on launch that have since been fixed. The developer is pretty quick to fix stuff, which is nice.\n\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nDespite immediate thoughts when I started the game, it does indeed have a story. There's a hidden key in every level that unlocks a single message (think of a diary entry or an email or whatever) expanding on the lore of the game. It's nothing to go crazy over in terms of depth, but a nice little touch. You don't have to care if you don't want to, as the game doesn't really shove it in your face which works out quite well for the game and allows the player to . I found some of the keys quite tricky to find. Other than that, the levels, enemies, mechanics and bosses are themed and named after the supposed 8 functions of life which is a really nice touch, whilst not amazingly deep adds some level of cohesiveness to what you otherwise be somewhat disparate.\n\n\n[h1]Design:[/h1]\nThe game has 8 levels, each one taking anywhere between 5 minutes to 15 minutes if you're extremely good at the game. Some levels can easily take up to an hour depending on how many times you die. The game also has several game styles that give the player character slightly different mechanics which affect the way you play a surprising amount.\n\nThe basic \"alpha playstyle\" that you start off with is focused around the core mechanics of:\n[list]\n[*] Dashing to manoeuvre and kill enemies and break barriers/objects (you have 3 use dash bar that refills over time. Kills refill 1 block of dash, so theoretically you could dash forever)\n[*] Jumping (bog standard stuff, though the game also plays with different physics somewhat)\n[*] Ground-slamming to manoeuvre and kill enemies and break barriers/objects (again, fills up the dash upon kills).\n[/list]\n\nBullets and platforms are synchronised to the beat of the song playing, which combined with the core game mechanics cause a cool result in terms of player routing and play. \n\nIn terms of design focus, Ersatz is imo a speed-run focused game. What I mean by this is that the game itself, whilst fairly difficult at times, is not difficult by any inherent virtue. Instead the game is designed down to its very core for the player to *perfect* their run. Pick the best path, use the best strategies for killing bosses, never stop moving, sync up with the game's rhythm and score the best time. At its best, Ersatz is neatly laid out to cause a kind of musical synchro when the player absolutely nails something (this is super hard to describe) -- There is a rhythm to this game, and damn does it know it. \nExcept when it doesn't.\nIn every level there are several unique mechanics that somewhat fit the theme of the level, and these are all neat little things that I found surprisingly intuitive. Now the issue lies with one of the later levels. This level is both my favourite, and my least favourite. I like the unique mechanics and the music and the aesthetic and the level layout, but frankly it doesn't gel with what the game is. The game whole being screams the opposite of what that level tries to enforce on the player. It's still fun, but imo it's the antithesis of what makes this game what it is. Thankfully the game doesn't drop the ball too badly elsewhere.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, I'd say the game starts of incredibly easy, and then ramps upon the 3rd and then 5th levels and then every level after that. I wouldn't recommend judging based on the first 1 or 2. That said, this is no needle/iwbtgfan game. This game wants you to perfect it, but it doesn't force you to :P. Then again, if you want to get good ranks on the levels be prepared to work hard - top tier play of this game is not easy to achieve and that is certainly one of this game's strengths\n\n(NOTE: There's a marathon mode unlockable called Journey Mode that lets you run the whole game in one go, but I haven't messed with that or the other playstyles too much. The other playstyles in particular change the way the game is played on a fairly fundamental level and add that little extra to the game's replay value. Marathon mode is one challenging mode, at least for me :) )\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nI'd recommend this game. It's good fun and it managed to keep me absorbed for a whole continuous run through which is something a whole host of games simply fail at achieving nowadays. Make no mistake, this is no steam shovelware. Whilst not terribly long for a single run (think 2-3 hours for your first time if you're bad like me) there's a hell of a lot of replay value, and the game is basically designed for perfecting your routes, tricks and runs to get the best times. I can see this being a very fun game to stream and definitely one you'll find yourself repeatedly coming back to.\nRECOMMENDED - It's not a perfect game (no games are!), but it fills a fairly unique niche and actually has content in it unlike a few games I've seen attempt the same kind of thing. I'm very, very satisfied with it. To be perfectly honest, I don't think I really got across what it is that's good and bad about this game. I think this is the kind of game you have to try and get a feel of.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505763318, "timestamp_created": 1505762682, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198093613065", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 170, "last_played": 1505942104, "playtime_forever": 365}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
