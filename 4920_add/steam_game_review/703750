Even though there are 4 types of robots which will need a different solution, they are the same 4 levels.\nThird, the game just isn't very interesting and is pretty easy, just time consuming due to the robot moving slow even on highest speed.\n\nThere are better alternatives in a similar style including for $1 so give this a miss until it is in a better state.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506507565, "timestamp_created": 1506030850, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "steamid": "76561198067097492", "num_reviews": 20, "num_games_owned": 3883, "last_played": 1506030607, "playtime_forever": 73}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
