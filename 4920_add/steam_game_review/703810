This game is obviously a joke. But the joke isn't funny.\nThe point where \"SUICIDE\" in your title is in comic sans, it is a joke.\nI like dark humor, but this game does not understand it. At all.\n\nMaking a game called \"Suicide Simulator\" is the equivelant to making an \"ISIS Simulator\", which is also another disaster this company has created. This game is a neverending sandbox with to rhyme or reason. The game is tinted red all the time, and the graphics are so bright, that I couldn't see the steps on a glass tower. I frequently found bugs, such as houses not touching the ground and random walls sitting in an infinite oblivion.\n\nGunplay is useless because I couldn't find any enemies, the knife was useless because there were no enemies. The only use I found for the two items were for hitting fire barrels and completing the objective of ccommiting suicide.\n\nThis game isn't even gag worthy, because it costs 3 dollars, the only reason why I got it was because I was morbidly curious to find what coupons after crafting badges were for. I guess if you got \"Lucky\" enough to get the coupon, you could give to your friend who deep down you hate immensely.\n\nThis game is nothing but a tasteless joke on a topic that needed much more working out to be funny.
