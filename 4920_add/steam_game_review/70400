Unique gameplay. Strong values of hard work and merit and pride of ownership and being debt free make it a great game for the young and those not yet indoctrinated. Based female protagonist makes for a great role model. Bug free. The game looks it's age, but the graphics still hold up fine. Was very surprised at this hidden gem. Highly recommend. Takes a bit of time to understand the gameplay system, but once you do, you'll be able to whip through a fun replay in no time. Lots to collect and craft. Great value at 10 dollars or less."}]}
