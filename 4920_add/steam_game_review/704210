The gameplay seems fine, except I couldn't find a way to fist people to death hence having to search for a unlocked car which are few and far between to murder the popo for their guns. Right now the main menu with the mini map is unescapable same with the atm machine menu.\n\nOverall I haven't played much of the missions yet so I cannot rate it completely but the \"open world\" aspect is fun and engaging for the short amount of time i've played it. There's still not much to this game yet, it's obviously not fleshed out and I wouldn't be recommending it even at the low price point.

The first thing i have to say about this game is that the faces on people are very nasty and facial movemets are non existent.

Oh and also the graphics kill your fps, even with an i7-7600K and Gtx 1070 the game is 30-40 fps and the graphics dont even look that great. Some features like running npc when you have a gun or at least screaming would be nice the game has almost no audio except some music and gunshots.
