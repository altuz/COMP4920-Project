I played it's prequel Freak Quency a long time ago but I can see some obvious visual cameos for the game even if my memory of the game is kind of blurry on the details XD\nWith more than 1 MC to choose from there's replay value not to mention the MC combination with each a possible romance ending out of 4 (or more) romancable characters.\nSo use your days back among the living wisely (and be at least over 50% evil) to get through the crazy game XD\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much like Persona 3 Portable with no dungeon crawling and you still have to work to get money. There's partial voice acting that pops up every now and then at random times and there are some typos but I don't think it's too much of a problem aside from the times they mention the wrong date (it happened a few times on Katy's route) lol", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": "5", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505879590, "timestamp_created": 1505843947, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 317, "steamid": "76561198247347122", "num_reviews": 59, "num_games_owned": 152, "last_played": 1506225519, "playtime_forever": 1920}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34763530", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505184", "review": "\nBought it, played it and I love it. So far it's very well written and interesting. However, I can't wait for a small walkthrough to be out since I have some difficulties completing missions that are important to the story line. Maybe I'm just bad at it ?\n\nEdit: The True ending is quite easy to get, which I find extremely nice since sometimes it can be TOO hard to find it by yourself. This game has a lot of replay value since each vessel and body is different, you have 4 different combination that changes the story a little. I also like the fact that you can't complete all of the quests in one playthrough, so if you really want to do them all, you will need multiple and each are quite interesting to do, even if they might be simple. \nAll in all, this game was worth the wait and an incredible sequel to Freak-Quency. I can't wait to see what the company will give us next !
