Pretty pictures, (mostly) reasonable story with relatively few typos. The protagonist seems to be a date rapist, though. \"Consent\" for him is based entirely on his perception of the woman's desires, not what she says to him. Yes, it's a fantasy world and we all want to escape to where things are easier than real life, but the creep factor of the protagonist is rather high. I haven't played through any other visual novels yet, so maybe this is a common trope, but it does seem to fit into the \"rape culture\" paradigm. Thankfully, with it being a video game/fantasy, they won't complain and we can all enjoy being an arrogant, haughty, born-with-a-silver-spoon sunuvabitch who is hugely successful with the ladies.
