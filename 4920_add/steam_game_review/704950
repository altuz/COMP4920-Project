Simple but fun combat\n. Good old retro look\n. Nice music\n\n-------\nCONS\n\n. Gate to go to the next floor can be right next to spawn\n. Not much items.\n. Short\n. Found a exploit where if you die to the boss and respawn, you can continue leveling up by hitting the boss and dying. Might want to fix that.\n\n-----\n\nOverall, this has a lot of potental, and would be a lot better with more stuff added in, such as new weapons, new enemy, and the ability to go past 15 floors and explore deeper.

It was developed in less than a year by one student alone. I can tell you that you get much more than you would expect. It simply delivers great content without actually beeing that complex. Fighting in the dungeons, attacking and dashing feels really great. There's a story beeing told, I'm glad. Also you can level up, upgrade your sword and learn a new skill, those are valuable features. I would recommend to empower those and expand their limits. I must say the art is beautiful and the soundtracks are amazing. Damm it's immersive! There is a little bit of an uncomfortable negative space in the dungeons in some spots, but it's expectable due to the dungeons beeing procedurally generated. Nice way to cut some time when developing! \nIf you support indie devs bet for this one and try this out, it's worth the money it costs. If you are an adventurer and wish to explore new games and great content, keep an eye on this game. Speaking of adventurers, I would've loved to have a minimap while in the dungeons! \nIn conclusion, the game is awesome for the amount of time put into it and the dev knowledge. Nonetheless, I will say I would not recommend you to buy it AT THE MOMENT due to gamebreaking bugs. Minor bugs (which game doesn't have it), were not the problem. I got stuck in the dungeons once but was able to get out by using the infinity rope. Nice addition! But then after doing my first boss, it was a glorious fight, I got stuck in a static screen without my character appearing on it. The only way to fix it was to start a new game. I will try to complete the game again because even if it was gamebreaking and I have to start all over again, I've already paid and I'm willing to support the dev. The game feels great anyway! I expect you to fix this issue.\n\nArt - 6/10\nProduction - 8/10\nDesign - 5/10\nProgramming - 3/10\nGameplay 6/10\nQA - 2/10\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nWith some minor fixes and solving the issue I mentioned above I would totally recommend this title and it would get an overall mark much higher. This game is now competing with other great titles and that's why I'm so demanding. Work on those fixes and QA, it's the only thing left to make this a really amazing experience.\n\nAs a final note I will say that even though I personally know the dev, this was the most objective review I could deliver. This game was the best out of my promotion. And it's published!

It is short and sweet, and really for the casual gamer, but is fun, short, and simple. There isn't too much to the game (atm), but with what is available, you will spend at least an hour or two trying to beat the game. I haven't encountered many glitches except one, and that was only when an enemy spawned in the \"black zone\" where the player can't reach. The only problem this posed was not being able to grab the gold it dropped. There are upgrades for items, though there aren't many. But each upgrade provides a noticable help to the player. The soundtrack plays in a loop, but it's 8-bit action packed tune doesn't wear you out, and makes you wish it would stop. The levels aren't too different, only getting bigger and filled with more enemies. The overworld doesn't have much to it, only ranging from the house square to the market square. The characters, though minimal, are fun to talk to. The leveling up system works flawlessly too, with each level providing a slight boost to damage and your special ability. Overall this game is really fun and doesn't overprice what it's worth. Hopefully the developer doesn't leave the game as is, and maybe adds a little more later on.
