Thankfully ancient temple design all came from the same temple template of same colored blocks.\n\nSwipe the escape scroll at the bottom of each temple and get out before it collapses is the core gameplay loop.  The randomly generated levels don't create any movement flow and players are often locked into long periods of waiting for blocks to randomly move in order to progress."}]}
