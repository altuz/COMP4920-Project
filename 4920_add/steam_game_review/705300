And did I mention that they're using royalty free music and sounds?\n\nAmazingly, the game takes only a few minutes to complete (*shocker*), so if you want to obtain all 4999 (notice I didn't say 5000) achievements, it'll only take you a few minutes to do so. He's not trying to hide the fact that it's barebones or an asset flip, so sad to see gaming consisting of titles like this. What's even more sad is that he actually hard-advertises one of his game, you stare at the poster of his game and you win. That's it.\n\nAlso, about the last achievement, you can't get it.
