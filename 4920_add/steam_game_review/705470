Right off the bat, it's a 3D first-person platformer, which is a type of game that often brings some inherent problems to the table. Jumps are often a bit picky, and some environment effects can catch you, even though it would have seemed you were safe.\n\nVisually, it looks all right, but not any more special than the content that comes pre-loaded in the Unreal Development Kit (The Coma is powered by Unreal Engine 4, in case you were curious,) so I really woldn't call it \"stunning.\" The atmosphere wasn't great as it was fairly silent and there wasn't anything tying these different environments together. In fact, I'd say that the atmosphere had to have been The Coma's weakest point, and that hurt the game overall.\n\nPlatformers are simple games because all you really do is jump over gaps and avoid obstacles. However, that doesn't make them bad, so long as you have something going on. Take an old Mario game, for example. The gameplay is simple and straight forward, but there are sound effects, infectious music, and a unified art style that develops a unique experience. The Coma doesn't do that. The Coma sits there silent, with only the 'clomp, clomp, clomp' of the character's footfalls to accompany you. By going from a surreal space environment, to a cube construct room, to a Greco-Roman temple, then to a sci-fi looking corridor, I'm left wondering 'why are these different things here?' Perhaps if The Coma had some kind of story that brings these together in some way, it would have been easier to get pulled into the experience, but there just... wasn't.\n\nThe Coma had the potential for an interesting game. We could have had some story that really delved into why this person had this vastly different concepts floating around in their head. We could have had a story evolve from the two \"light and darkness avatars\" debating over the fate of this individual that they're huddled around. Hell, we could have had some direction on where to go and what we were actually trying to achieve. But, this game doesn't have any of that. Instead we have silent platforming with no reason or motivation to do any of it.\n\nUltimately, I can not recommend this game, there just isn't enough there to justify it. It is just so lacking in content that it feels like a beta release, maybe even an alpha release, but certainly not a final release.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1504941985, "timestamp_created": 1504941985, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197993925975", "num_reviews": 7, "num_games_owned": 58, "last_played": 1504660429, "playtime_forever": 15}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
