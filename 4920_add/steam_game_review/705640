I think it would be more fun playing the multi-player with friends. The graphics are cartoon like but look great. I did run into a bit of lag while playing not sure why. Its a good way to kill time but at $8.49- on sale $9.99 normal price I think its over price. I would put this game at $4.99 the way it sets now. I still would recommend buying this game as I think the Dev has got a good thing here and with the right touch it could be a great game.", "votes_down": 5, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505628359, "timestamp_created": 1505628359, "written_during_early_access": true, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "steamid": "76561198024791846", "num_reviews": 18, "num_games_owned": 220, "last_played": 1506917363, "playtime_forever": 36}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34881948", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481750", "review": "so what to say about this game...\n\nfirstly lets play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28rd16XavD4\n\nThis game is very very simmilar to orcs must die. It's a wave based tower defence game where you face off against ever increasing waves of enemys. \n\nI found this game to be lacking online multiplayer (I assume due to not having to host multiplayer servers and saving money?) \n\nThe gameplay is simple. fun, but dose get repettitive.\n\nYou will be giving pro's and con's each level. so say you maybe will run 30% faster but you will be on 50% health this round for example. maybe it should be a risk system.. so you wont always get bonned over each round?\n\nthe graphics are cartoon like but very sharp and good textures and on my system at least it ran very smooth.
