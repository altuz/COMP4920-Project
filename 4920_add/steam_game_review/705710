I was excited that I was in for something unique after seeing the game's trailer and booting the game up to see that its visuals weren't bad, and impressed by its coherent seeming shooting and melee functions during the tutorial (with either a bow and arrow or sword and shield respectively...) \n\nThe trailer depicts a slow, methodical hunt of what I was assuming would be a single, lone enemy you're tracking, adding to the tension and immersion... Instead, the game immediately spawns roughly 36 of the same enemy all charging you (so much for hunting, right??) yelling \"Die! Die! Die!\" over and over, running at you in a beeline, clipping through the various trees scattered around while you do the same. After you eliminate a couple waves of the enemies (about 30+ of the same enemy, all doing the same B-Boy breakdancing looking attack, falling backward on their hands and kicking their feet up at you..) you are placed against a single foe, which I (hope??) is a more unique-looking enemy, but I wouldn't know as this is pretty much all you can see during that sequence:\n\nhttps://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/878623245762558912/946329B94E812100E86E1DF5C7448F55C1058714/\n\n\n(the omnipresent, vague \"Message Box\" text is there for flavor, I guess...) \n\nIt's pretty much impossible to see anything other than the rain hitting the ground and the faint outlines of ~some~ trees as you meander along aimlessly. I could hear the one enemy yelling the same \"Die!\" phrase at me over and over nearby, so I just stood there in place, unmoving for a few minutes hoping he would eventually come to me, or that I might catch a glimpse of where he was during one of the very brief lightning flashes to kill him and progress, but no such luck so I quit the game and now I'm writing this review. \n\nYou seem to have infinite health and near infinite ammo (999 arrows...) but the game tells you to collect health and ammo from defeated enemies. They scatter various items as they are eliminated, and these seem to boost you to have \"God Mode Activated!\" (on top of your already ample -infinite?- health)  \"Speed Boost Activated!\" \"Super Jump Activated!\" which makes for some fun running around rapidly and jumping super high into the air, but why is this not depicted in the trailer at all???? Is this the same game??\n\nI would say the game has potential as a more arcade-y experience, and I don't want to disparage the creator (s) too bad, but what's here and what's being displayed as being sold are completely different. If this game were to lean more heavily into its ridiculous, zany, (frankly somewhat pointless) gameplay and had more pickup, weapon, or level variety it might be worth checking out, but as-is it seems very inconsequential. If I were able to at least see the 1 enemy during the pitch black section to defeat and progress I might still give the game a go, but that is basically a game-breaking hindrance to an already very shallow experience.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": "2", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506398210, "timestamp_created": 1506396415, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "steamid": "76561198173606567", "num_reviews": 148, "num_games_owned": 800, "last_played": 1506394552, "playtime_forever": 17}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35139278", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507772", "review": "I was the worst game I can see that the person worked hard on it but, fix things make more updates and change the sky you are using the unity skybox", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506120240, "timestamp_created": 1506120240, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "steamid": "76561198326534652", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 15, "last_played": 1506120011, "playtime_forever": 11}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35476995", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508407", "review": "Same game as all of his other spam-games.
