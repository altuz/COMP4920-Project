What this game doesn't have in the stunning graphics department, it more than makes up for in the gameplay element.  It's just fun to explore these caves.  This is quite the bargain for the sale price of $4.79 USD and worth a lot more than that [u] Note: I played this game on the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers and had zero issues.  [/u]\n\nI highly recommend you start the recommended gameplay mode and turning the scary bugs on also to the recommended (why it's not default I have no idea).  In this mode, you start off by equipping the helmet (you just grab it with the grip and put it on top of your head, no other button pushes needed, it'll stay on your head when you move it there), the utility belt, the flashlight and/or glowstick (I prefer just the glowstick), and finally the tracker locomotion device that you throw with the grip button and teleport there.  Most of the reviews mention the locomotion as a negative thing, however, I found the locomotion to be more immersive done this way (teleport would be too easy, joystick movemen would be too easy, arm waving running style would be dumb).  I quickly got used to the locomotion after 60 seconds and had no issues throwing the device where I wanted.  It just made sense and was more fun this way.\n\nWhat this game got right is the sense of discovery.  It's just amazing going down these caves and finding snails that you can pick up or giant bugs which you can also carry and put in your utility belt.  And you find things while exploring like gems that you need to buy stuff you discover.  You'll see a flare gun and pick it up. But then you'll need the right gems to unlock it in a future exploration.  The caves may seem monotonous or monochromatic green at first (depending on your random generation), but there's little surprises thrown in there (and not just the wildlife), for example you'll see glowing crystal patterns or underwater grottos.  You'll start seeing blue crystallized areas of the cave.  Just tons of little surprises as a reward for your exploration.  You'll go deeper into the cave and wonder just how far down the rabbit hole you can go.\n\nThis game actually makes me wish I could go to a real cave and do all this cool shit, minus the bugs.  Any game which can make you want to do that IRL is a game that got the experience done correctly.\n\nRating 8/10 \n\n", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506195610, "timestamp_created": 1506195610, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_reviews": 210, "num_games_owned": 846, "last_played": 1506194385, "playtime_forever": 51}, "votes_up": 8, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35409496", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512511", "review": "Excellent exploring caves game with equipment upgrades and mining, gem find.

It's fun and immersive and definitely leaves you wanting more afterwards. It offers a few hours of quality entertainment, which is a pretty good deal for its price. I would strongly recommend it for people wanting new and interesting experiences to have in VR.\n\nYou explore gaves by throwing a \"teleporter\" around, which also creates a series of waypoints which you can warp back to if you hit a dead end or go the wrong way. You get glowsticks which you can use to light the cave around you, thus helping keep track of where you've been. As you explore, you find crystals and better gear for moving around and seeing, such as a head light, a belt with more \"pockets\", or my favourite, the grappling hook.\n\nPersonally I really enjoyed the experience. Everywhere you go gives you that sort of \"wow, look at this\" feeling as you light it up and search for gear or crystals. The caves are very pretty and the art style is perfect for it. You also start to become very completionist, quickly wanting to search every nook and cranny of the cave until the whole place is lit up with glowsticks. The addition of gear like the snorkel means there are some areas which you'll have to backtrack to in order to fully explore them, which adds a sort of progression feel to the game.\n\nThere are some downsides, however. First of all, throwing your teleporter to move is an incredibly frustrating experience at first, as it tends to kind of dribble out of your hands instead of travel any useful distance. This is partially because they designed it so that you press the grip button to release objects instead of holding it down and releasing at the height of the throw. Secondly, glowsticks are unlimited but you have to relight them every single time you throw them. While this isn't a huge issue, if you forget to light it and throw it you've just lost your entire stock of glowsticks and have to go pick one up again. You eventually get skilled enough not to worry about these issues, but it does take a lot of practice.\n\nFurthermore, although the caves are \"procedurally generated\", it quickly becomes obvious that it's not the cave \"rooms\" which are procedurally generated, but the locations of the rooms instead. Because of this you will soon start to recognize (and get bored of) certain features from previous cave runs, which heavily reduces replayability. Also a lot of the items you can find are kind of pointless (why would I use an old flame lantern when glowsticks have more light and are in unlimited supply?), and have to be purchased at the start of every new cave with gems you collected in previous runs.\n\nAnyway, despite my complaints I found the game to be thoroughly entertaining and well worth the money. I hope maybe in the future they'll expand on this game and release more types of caves, items etc. It could be the start of something amazing.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506307430, "timestamp_created": 1506307430, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 140, "steamid": "76561198005186949", "num_reviews": 9, "num_games_owned": 280, "last_played": 1506269651, "playtime_forever": 140}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35094266", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505754", "review": "Very nice experience. Reminded me of the feeling you get the first time you ever find a huge cave system in minecraft.\n\nIts pretty relaxing exploring the randomly generated caves and finding gear left behind by other spelunkers that have come before you, the wildlife is a nice touch when you find them. Particularly liked the animation on the longfin eels.\n\nPlaying the default mode where you pick some gear, find better things in the cave and bring back gems to exchange for better gear next time gives a sense of progress, but i would like to be able to buy gear i didnt have when i come back to the surface so i can return back into the same cave in one sitting. Like keep the \"store/gear selection\" table at the surface so i can return to it.\n\nI take issue with the current throw mechanics though. As they are right now you throw something as soon as you press the grip button, which is counter intuitive.  I would prefer it if they were changed to release the throw on release of the grip button (like you press and hold grip to activate \"throw\" mode and when you let go of grip the hand would release the item.)\n\nI feel like the game/experience is fairly priced for whats contained within.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505952452, "timestamp_created": 1505952452, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "steamid": "76561197985602485", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 333, "last_played": 1506147776, "playtime_forever": 65}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35092616", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504197", "review": "Pretty good.

The progression system adds a layer of value to all of the exploration you do, but for some the wonder of new 'biomes' or at least new vistas will be reward enough while playing Echo Grotto.\n\nA thin but sometimes-frustrating layer sits on top of the captivating art, sound, and design in this game; the interaction system. Grips do most of the interaction, and when moving your hand around your belt to grab items some seem to grab involuntarily. Your hand may get stuck in or out of the 'near enough to grab' state, causing you to wiggle your arm violently to wake it back up.\n\nMoving is quite frequently a mix of happy-accidents and inexplicably well placed tosses to get your anchor in exactly the right place.
