What would possibly go wrong?!\"\n\n\"Quite a lot, as it turns out. Starved of protection in to the form of flashlight batteries and matchboxes/campfires, and hunted by unimaginable horrors, you must rely on quick thinking as well as the 6 arrows in your crossbow to postpone becoming a meal for the denizens of the woods. But carry on you must as your sweet daughter's life hangs in the balance. One way or another you will see her again soon.\"\n\nDevil in the Pines is a great little survival horror game by the fledgling studio Rebelware Games. If you have a taste for indie horror, or if you're looking for something not satisfied in the rest of the steam catalog, I'd definitely recommend it. As with any indie horror game, prepare to die a lot before you learn the systems. While consequences in a game like Dark Souls might make you afraid to die, Devil in the Pines makes you afraid to live. Don't worry though, regardless of where you are, you are most assuredly seconds away from death.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506726329, "timestamp_created": 1506726164, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 70, "steamid": "76561198027436242", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 39, "last_played": 1506722895, "playtime_forever": 70}, "votes_up": 13, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35483661", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "You'll be able to find this game on my YouTube channel this weekend as a Let's Play. Just coming out of playing it for an hour or so, here are my opinions on the game thus far...\n\n-It's initially terrifying, introducing enemies without much warning... however, I wouldn't mind a build-up to these enemies, like each of them having their own little section to teach us how to deal with them (so that way 'trial and error' isn't an issue) before the big ol' key hunt.\n\n-The sound design is great, no complaints there.\n\n-The story's interesting, but it's a shame I couldn't reach the end.\n\n-I find that the varying difficulties don't change the AI much, if at all. Yes, you can be more generous with the items, but a change in the AI behavior/difficulty wouldn't be too much to ask for. If I'm on \"Baby Girl\" mode, I was hoping it'd be a breath of relief from \"Normal\" mode, which felt no different other than the items.\n\n-The demon's way too fast for his own good in any difficulty. A nerf on his speed for those who aren't crackshots would be a nice change for casual gamers who don't play that many shooters. Additionally, the distance the demon should spawn from you and when he appears should be vastly increased so something like spawning then manifesting right next to you within a second doesn't occur; mind you, I was also trapped.\n\n-The traps are either too subtle or too frequent. If you step on a trap and you're getting chased, you're done. That's all there is to it, really. It's hard to spot them if I'm getting pursued in the moment.\n\n-The hands that just appear out of nowhere feel too frequent and are annoying, because I believe they slow you down, which will get you killed if you're getting chased by the Possessed. If you get both at the same time, which more than likely you will the more you approach the key, you're pretty much a goner.\n\n-The Possessed are either too fast, or the sprint for the player is too short. This in combination with the hands or a trap willl get you killed quickly, so I wouldn't mind a change to this in some way.\n\n-I only got to the burning forest part once, and ooooooooooooo boy, that's a mess. I'm unaware if the fire pits will save you from what looked like fire demons, but all of that has to be less hectic. I can get a chase scene, but if you're gonna hide fire demons in fire while there's text that tells you to RUN, of course you're going to panic and not pay close enough detail to demons dancing in the fire. Making them much more noticable and much less like the Possessed where they can keep up and kill you for running out of sprint would be nice.\n\nOverall, if you want a challenge and you can aim well, then feel free to try this game. I'm more into a casual experience, so this isn't exactly my cup of tea. If you want a casual experience, I'd look at other games for now until some things are nerfed. In conclusion, I'd give this a thumbs up, but by just a bit. I have high hopes for this game, but it obviously has to be polished. Hope this review helps; have a great day!\n\nYou can check out my channel here for the game's Let's Play within the weekend: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHgYdpLEy59XKbiruPSHA6g?view_as=subscriber", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507165737, "timestamp_created": 1507165671, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "steamid": "76561198140550076", "num_reviews": 17, "num_games_owned": 85, "last_played": 1507164280, "playtime_forever": 69}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35359599", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496178", "review": "Way too scary! holy s***!
