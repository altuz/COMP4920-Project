Up to 4 teams of worms do battle over an ever-changing battlefield with falling weapon crates, crazed exploding sheep and more besides. Winner of many industry awards, find out what all the fuss was about. Experience for yourself where it all started on the PC. Worms requires great thought, strategy and elements of sheer outrageous fortune. Not only that, but with an almost infinite range of playing possibilities, no two games are ever the same!\n\n[u]Release Date: 30 Oct, 1995[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay [/h1]\nItself will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever played a Worms game - take turns navigating purposefully cumbersome worms across a dangerous terrain, utilising increasingly dangerous weaponry to, you know, destroy all enemies - and in this original release it works remarkably well. Some gameplay tweaks from future instalments are missing here - once you begin to fire a bazooka, for instance, you cannot change its trajectory at the last minute. Inconsistencies in the A.I. are also present - at times, computer-controlled worms freeze for the duration of their turn; other times, they fire missiles and throw grenades with accuracy that guarantees a perfect hit. Worms has always been best enjoyed with other people, however, and that doesn\u2019t change here. For a 20-year-old game running on a slightly shaky version of DosBox*, it looks and sounds fantastic.\n\nAll in All [u]Worms[/u] is a very nice Retro Game!\n\n10/10 From Me\n[i] Sweep[/i]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502210597, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34107307", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057221241", "num_reviews": 280, "last_played": 1503762041, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 13}, "timestamp_updated": 1502210597, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Classic"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501243696, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33854264", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197989037125", "num_reviews": 72, "last_played": 1501244183, "num_games_owned": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 25}, "timestamp_updated": 1501243696, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Good ol' Worms <3..
