Add bazookas, dynamite and unprecedented destruction to taste. This recipe should serve a truly hefty helping of fun!\n\n[u]Release Date: 30 Mar, 2002[/u]\n\n[h1] The Gameplay[/h1]\nIf you like bubble bobble AKA bust a move, tetris attack, or worms, you'll be pleasantly surprised that such a nuanced culmination can exist. I can think of no way in which this game is not perfect. I've been playing this game competitively for years, and with each passing year, new bold strategies to best my opponent keep manifesting. Even the bugs are masterful! Shields don't always work, and you can submerge yourself with a tongue-in-cheek shot offscreen and pop up like a cork on your opponent's terf. If you value your time, play this game with a friend. For the price of a pizza, you can enjoy gaming nirvana.\n\nAll in All [u]Worms Blast[/u] is a good Old School Game!\n\n10/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep [/i]"}]}
