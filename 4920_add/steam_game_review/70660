The classic Worms\u2122 Pinball sends the cute little pink guys spinning across one of the most realistic pinball tables ever created. Battle with honour through the mystic art of Worms. Kung-Fu or hang at high noon with the grizzliest, pinkest cowboys this side of Texas. Only Worms. Pinball offers an action packed pinball simulation of pure wormage! Worms. Pinball leaves nothing to the imagination. The table sports 3D LED displayed sub-games and parallel objectives, transparent ramps, user-controllable moving gadgets, moving mechanical parts and wild sound effects and music. The table contains over 150 animated parts and thousands of frames of rendered FMV animation for the LED display. It\u2019s got tilt functions, hit combinations as well as drop and dead catches, bounce and flip passes, bang backs, death saves, magnetic fields and countless other exciting features. The depth of gameplay, variety of action and sophisticated table rules ensures that Worms Pinball will have all gamers, not just hard-core pinheads, hooked.\n\n[u] Release Date: 19 Oct, 2011[/u]\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nWorms Pinball is a great pinball game with a fun and entertaining table that provides adequate challenge. The pads are responsive, the physics are decent, all the ramps and pits are accessible with just enough practise, and the old-school Worms 1 theme adds the perfect amount of nostalgia factor to make you revisit it from every now and then.\nWhat is atrocious though and makes part of me want to give it a thumbs down, is the price. This one used to be called Addiction Pinball with an additional table (featuring a now-forgotten Team 17 game, \u2018World Rally Racing\u2019, an even better table) and cost less on disc at release than this one on Steam now.\nIf you can grab it in a bundle, do so, but I highly advise against actually purchasing it even at half discount.\n\nAll in All [u]Worms Pinball[/u] is a really nice Arcade Game!\n\n8/10 From Me\n[i]Sweep[/i]"}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499739934, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33445916", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197963130155", "num_reviews": 38, "last_played": 1499739382, "num_games_owned": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1499739934, "received_for_free": false, "review": "First I would like to correct the release date on this title. This is no 2011 game, the copyright in game in 1998, and I believe that to be the real release date. Not even capable of 1080p. I will not compare it as a WORMS game, as it is not in any way. Compared to other pinball games however, it's age and floaty physics make it very hard to recommend in todays market. It is fun, and if you get it in a bundle or the super cheap, might be worth a few mins *thats all I spent on it*. If you looking for a WORMS game, as stated, this is not one, just themed. If your looking for pinball, there are other offerings, that give you a free table to start with.\nSo in the end, unless your a super fan, and got this at a very heavy discount, I could not in good faith recommend it, by itself. For it's day, maybe..but not today.\nI will place a not recommended vote, but reserved, I want to like it but can not ignore it's faults, and competition. However, if they were to refresh this table and maybe offer it to another pinball platform...who knows."}]}
