These are some of the best graphics/audio I've seen in vr. It's not a game at all and you can't pick things up so don't be expecting that when you buy it, it is totally immersive though, you put on the vive and you feel liek youre in a totally different place, exactly how vr should be. The level of detail is so good so I think the price is very fair as you can tell how much work has gone into it. Headphones are a must. I can't wait to make my little brother try it!
