This game does not fail to amaze you with the difficulty curve Miner Ultra fans have grown to love. \n\nThe game runs at a rock solid 1080p 60fps, which is a dramatic upgrade over the first installment. Only keyboard is supported in solo mode, but if you want to share the fun with a friend be sure to check out the co-op mode! P2 can use a controller there.\n\nThe musical presentation in this game is incredible, with a variety of MIDI songs to keep your hopes up as you die over and over due to near-impossible obstacles. Without them, controllers would be thrown and windows shattered.\n\nThe bosses are... interesting... and simple to beat. They all require the same strategy: spam the gun and hit them as much as possible. The game still uses Blender, which is a tradition to the Miner Ultra series. The game ends after you beat the evil Illuminati pyramid, and you fly away with your beautiful friend, Lil' Pauline.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game due to the amount of frustration resulting from the near-impossible obstacles in the early levels. Often times, Mike Wazowski will fall from the sky and crush Minerinho, leaving me zero time to react.\n\nSWEEEEEEEET HOME ALABAMA!", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506109415, "timestamp_created": 1506109355, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 282, "steamid": "76561198069677496", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 129, "last_played": 1506057687, "playtime_forever": 283}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35235037", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502734", "review": "9/10\ns\u00f3 precisa melhorar a inicializa\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo, demora um pouco mas t\u00e1 j\u00f3ia", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506484774, "timestamp_created": 1506484774, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "steamid": "76561198198909477", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 66, "last_played": 1506484673, "playtime_forever": 7}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
