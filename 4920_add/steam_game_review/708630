I do not have a dedicated GPU, but still 45FPS on an i7. There are optimization issues that need tending to. The camera and interaction is not well implemented. The camera feels like it's hovering on a block of ice, and there is no interaction key. You even have to press ALT to show the cursor, which I found very unattractive. All this said; however, the game has room for improvement, and I hope to see it become Steam's little zelda emulation.
