Armament offers a level based design (3 levels) in the vein of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, but with the subtle maze-like structure of Quake. Likewise, Armament offers a nod to actions films like Terminator and Aliens (which inspired early FPS). But instead of aliens, machines, or Nazis, Armament offers a battle through a prison in the context of a dystopian society and government class wars.\nThough brief, the game is a fun little FPS experience. I like the storyline (I\u2019m biased in enjoying a deeper story to my FPS), but the story is a little too complex for a shorter game. I think such nuanced storytelling will prove useful as DYS Top builds more complex games. \nAs a nascent developer and publisher, DYS Top shows promise for future games with the likes of Armament. I look forward to checking out their sophomore release.", "votes_down": 8, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506865284, "timestamp_created": 1506865284, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "steamid": "76561198427902741", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 1, "last_played": 1506865211, "playtime_forever": 31}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35384435", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484178", "review": "A fun Indie FPS!
