Adorable characters, exciting story. The game is not overly complex, but makes you think and calculate your actions both on the battlefield and inbetween combats. Important thing is that you are never stuck if you cannot beat a level, just go back and replay previous levels on a higher difficulty. Quite addictive.\n\nOn the negative side, the workshop is clunky to access. The music  could've been more varied. There are some minor bugs, though developer actively fixes them, so I guess it will be alright soon.

Very light in most respects, it's really just about the quick missions and surprisingly deep weapon type vs. resistance and upgrading systems.\n\nThe art is beautiful and static. The writing is brisk and jaunty but not impactful enough to have any weight. Who cares - it's not that kind of game; no dialogue options or branching. Mission, upgrade, mission, etc.\n\nCombat takes place on cramped grids of squares. There's both not a lot to do (move or fire) but a lot to consider. It almost feels puzzly (because of the unique firing mechanism) but it's chaotic and unscripted enough to not be a problem.\n\nBonus points given for the flawless combat interface. Things couldn't be clearer. Slight deductions for the fiddly inventory system which is a shame because loadout optimizing is fun and I would have done more if it wasn't so clicky. Completely stable and silky smooth at 3440.\n\nIt took around 10 hours to finish the campaign. There's more available if you like getting perfect missions - I still had some room to progress with my weapons, ships and characters. Super polished, especially for a tiny team indie. Nice job. I'd totally play a multiplayer version of this.\n\nFull review [url=https://oldgrizzledgamers.com/reviews/hidden-gems/steam-tactics-review/]here.[/url]", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505580190, "timestamp_created": 1505580163, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561197998030586", "num_reviews": 8, "num_games_owned": 472, "last_played": 1505580702, "playtime_forever": 800}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35042128", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "review": "It's a honest game. Not really hard when you understand how to play but can be a bit grindy by moment.\n\nThe story is doable in 15 hours ( but I grinded a bit so it can be finished earlier ) and I still got a bunch of 2 and 3 stars levels to do to max everything, I suppose I would need less than 25 hours to completly finish it. Kind of honest for a 12 $ game and I think I could replay it later.\n\nBattles takes place on a 8x6 grid, with random unpassable tiles and some bonus/malus tiles ( more/less damages or resistances ). Regularly a repair kit or a chest of gold can appear on the field.\n\nEach ship has 6 different resistances to damages to counter the 6 different kind of weapon. All the weapons come with various range and fire direction ( either in line or in diagonal ). Flamers and acid-sprayers got the lowest range, missiles got the longest. There is no AOE or multi-hitting mechanics in this game. Each time you attack a ship it can counter-attack IF you are in range of one of his weapon and the same rule apply to your own counter-attacks.\n\nShips also have different \" equip load \". This value represent how heavy your combined weapons load is and affect how many tiles your ship can travel per turn. The max is 4 and the min is 1. But the various weapons got different weight ( flamers and sprayers being the lighter ones and missiles/canons the heaviers ) which combined to the right ships allow you to use up to 3 weapons while still being able to move enough. It's possible to mix weapons ( using a flamers with a machine gun and a missile launcher ) but weapons damage and critical rate are affected by the pilote skills, so it's best to specialize the pilots and focus on 1 or 2 type of weapons only.\n\nOverall some weapons works better than others. Missiles and canons feels a bit useless ( at least in the story part ) because the battlegrounds are only 8X6 with some clutter. So long ranged weapons aren't that good because it's too easy to get boxed and cornered by ships with short range weapons without being able to fire back. I will also add the fact that a lots of ennemy ships have huge resistance to canon attacks overall. Flamers and sprayers are way better choices BUT all levels always feature highly ( mostly immune ) resistant to one of these attack ships so you still need to mix and match the others weapons to win.\nSo yeah the battle feels balan\u00e7ed enough but the base tactic is always the same to win : Focus all your fire on one ennemy, destroy it then focus on another. So it make the game repetitive, bigger maps with more varied ships per battle would be better.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505727889, "timestamp_created": 1505727889, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 120, "steamid": "76561198032265427", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 270, "last_played": 1506023598, "playtime_forever": 1156}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34919453", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499673", "review": "I am fond of tactical games.
