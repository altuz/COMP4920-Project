Thats fine for me, after all that is what is intended to be for serious strategy 4X games.\n\nBut complexity needs the appropriate tools, interface and AI to work fine. Unfortunately this game lacks all of theme. Yes it is complex, but it turns out to become very chaotic in the end. \n\nSo you probably get fed up and let everything be managed by the AI. The AI governors will actually do a good job for you and the only thing left to do is designing ships (which is actually a cool part of the game), building theme into thousands with out any limitations and penalties and sending theme to massacres under a very aggressive AI which doesn't give you much choices than to go into meaningless chaotic wars. \n\nJust curious, doesn't a ship have any maintenance expenses? And build by the thousands? It wouldn't be a problem managing such a large numbers of units, but you don't have the appropriate tools to do that or at least the ones provided are very poor.\n\nDiplomacy is very poor, management of empire also poor and with out any perceptive, interface controllers and functions a bit strange and difficult to adjust even for experienced strategy gamers. The game also lacks a sense of personality, rather mediocre.  \n\nSo finally in the end you have got this enormous in numbers ships and just send theme to battles, one after another, contentiously... ba ba doom booom... boring... still for some this might be enough and very entertaining.\n\nOn the other hand, graphs and layout are quite good, simple and minimal which in my aesthetic (and functionality) perspective is good.

A game could include over a thousand star systems if it's running on high-end hardware.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] Unsurprisingly, nothing too amazing (though the planets actually look pretty nice), but then at the scale most games of [i]Star Ruler[/i] run, it should be considered something of a small miracle that there are as many objects rendered as there are. The UI is mainly just functional, nothing too pretty; it's not as intuitive as it could be and it can be hard to figure out what's going on even if you read the necessary literature, but it's nothing that can't be gotten used to.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b] Pretty standard space game fare. The soundtrack is decent enough, though a little light on tracks. Some notification sounds can be easy to miss or sound too much like other notifications.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] This game has as deep a ship design element as one could hope for (like the creation of ships the size of star systems that shoot planet-sized asteroids, if one so wishes and has the means) as well as an interesting approach to tech trees which adds an element of chance to breakthroughs and branching. Unfortunately, the gameplay is usually too fast-paced to take full advantage of the ship design features and the pace of the game also negatively impacts the management of planets as well (an element that seemed fairly well done at first). Additionally, there seems to be an unresolved bug regarding energy weapons never cooling down, so avoiding those is recommended. Overall, however, the gameplay of [i]Star Ruler[/i] feels a bit like [i]Supreme Commander[/i] or [i]Planetary Annihilation[/i] on the scale of a galactic 4X, albeit with a good deal more of untapped depth.\n\n[b]This reviewer gives Star Ruler: 7/10[/b]\n\n[b]Additional Note:[/b] The Galactic Armoury mod adds a fair amount of content to the game and is highly recommended.

The core realtime 4x gameplay gives you a ton of freedom and ship design is fun and open, while the game progresses to eventually become really hectic. The customization and stuff isn't overdone to the point of being spergy like in some of these types of games. However, the game is pretty graphically poor, there being only two visually distinct sets of ship designs and everything being sort of par for the course budget indie space game graphics. The studio seems tiny though so can't really fault em that. A bigger issue is that the gameplay tends to degenerate into walling off a section of the map well enough that the AI can't bust through easily, and then beelining a ship of such a large scale none of the AIs can deal with it as it blows up planet and sun after planet and sun. The basic resource gameplay is realtime resource chain management sort of similar to Anno games, at which the AI has perfect micro - the difficulty setting seems to be what bonuses they get, and I couldn't find a difficulty at which I could have a back-and-forth fight with the AIs. Either I would crush them outright, fight them to a stalemate then win after two hours of turtling like outlined above, or get totally raped. This game seems to have a lot of potential for multiplayer but there ain't nobody playin this obscure ass indie pile lol. With more dynamic and varied AI this could be great.
