The mouse is also visible the entire time you are playing and moving around.\n\nI was unable to get my xbox controller to work even though there are control maps in the options.\n\nOther than control issues, the game seemed interesting. I beat the first level and made it to the second.  \nThe premise is that you need to destroy the MRSA virus with some kind of pill gun (left click), while simultaniously destroying cholesterol with a lasor (right click).  Graphics are not super fine, but I found them appealing.  The second stange looked really neat, so I'll give them that. \n\nAudio is about average, with funny dialogue spoken every once in a while. \n\nIf the dev could fix the control issues, I would have been interested enough to play more.
