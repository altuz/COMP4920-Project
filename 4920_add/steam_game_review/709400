Enemies however have a different goal in mind and will swarm you relentlessly trying to crash you up.  Definitely a lot of hand/eye coordination required here.  Combined with the catchy music, this small Unity value game delivers some fun!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmle5FkF2ss\n\nControls couldn't be simpler.  WASD used on the keyboard, no mouse required.  W to go, S to slow, A & D to swirve your truck left and right.  The Space bar gives you a Nitro boost but is limited by a cool down.  Hit the targets, and use Nitro to allow you to get some revenge on the swarming enemies.  Hitting more targets faster helps get you a bigger multiplier to get bigger score totals.  The game keeps track of the top 9 Steam scores so you'll always have a target score total to aspire to reach, which is nice for a game like this.\n\nGame has two modes, both single player.  One gives you 3 \"hit\" points or 3 lives if you would, and you'll gain a life every level you advance, and the other mode gives you three times the points but only one chance to wreck and your game is over.\n\nYou can play with a controller, but WASD and Space worked just fine for me with fluid, responsive controls.\n\nMy only gripes were there are ZERO options available.  No sound settings, no resolution options, no key mapping, and not even a full screen/window option.  Bare bones in the options department.  Also there was no cursor on the main screen and selecting a mode and hitting start was tricky for me.. not being able to see a cursor, but that might be because of my dual monitors and might not be an issue for most players. \n\nMy Score for Low Desert Punk is a 74%, mostly hurt by a lower then you might expect \"value\" score.  Even at the price tag under a dollar, I think the game is addictive enough to make most people want to play it a few times, but that will likely only add up to a half an hour for most people.  Good game and fun while it lasts however!", "votes_down": 6, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506611686, "timestamp_created": 1506610707, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "last_played": 1506733496, "playtime_forever": 90}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
