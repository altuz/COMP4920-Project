After winning playing Until the Last, here are my thoughts.\n\nThis is a very, very short game. I died twice and won it the third time. Those 3 attempts took me 24 minutes. If you read the help before playing the game you could easily win it the first try. That means the game could take a tiny 7 minutes to win.\n\nYes there is the replayability factor. The items appear randomly and you could go through the motions of doing everything again and again. \n\nSo the time it took to win the game was obviously a big negative. It felt like one level of a much bigger game. I was actually dissapointed when after winning the first level there was nothing more.\n\nThe actual gameplay elements were fun. Running around, trying to escape the monster, looking for the items (this could become frustrating if they spawn in difficult places), and defusing the bomb were all generally fun.\n\nTo summarize, this is a fun little Indie game, but it's just way, way too short. 7 Minutes?! Thats just crazy. For that fact I can't recommend this game. If it had 9 or 10 more levels, then I would have recommended it.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505256146, "timestamp_created": 1505256146, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198035305338", "num_reviews": 3, "num_games_owned": 90, "last_played": 1505255547, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "34925884", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426272", "review": "The graphics are okay and the atmosphere is really nicely done. however, it seems completely random whether you win or lose. things happen randomly and dont make much sense. sometimes things will spawn right next to you and kill you and other times you just get jumpscared. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_tO4r_VwgY&feature=youtu.be", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505331191, "timestamp_created": 1505331191, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198036777325", "num_reviews": 103, "num_games_owned": 152, "last_played": 1505324324, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 2, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
