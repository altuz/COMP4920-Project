Two different game modes available: Tower Defemse and Endless Runner. The first has you lobbing watermelons and other hazards like bubbles and explosive snowmen at enemies that approach your tent, the other casts you as a mushroom in a standard running scenaerio to grab coins. Each zone of each level is broken down into stages you need to earn stars to fully complete by meeting objectives that aren't specified in the TD approach, but the ER rerquirementd are standard and include the coins.\n\nThey even include a \"Get it on the Google Play store\" icon on the lower right of thr screen, and it's probably free. If it is, just get it there. Nothing astounding, just surprising frustration from having to click weapons with your mouse instead of easily tapping them with your finger. Both modes have been better, and both done to death as well.", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506453784, "timestamp_created": 1506453784, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "steamid": "76561198025037510", "num_reviews": 109, "num_games_owned": 3292, "last_played": 1506482316, "playtime_forever": 42}, "votes_up": 4, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
