Nico Nico Douga is at war against a far-reaching storm of disturbance and deletion. Nico Nico's economy is badly weakened: a consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility on the part of acknowledgement, but also on the collective failure to make hard choices and to prepare for a new, MAD age.\n\nToday, I say to you, that the challenges are real, and they are many. They will not be easily met, or in a short span of time, but know this, Nico Nico: they will be met. In reaffirming the greatness of our site, we understand that greatness is never given, our journey has never been one of shortcuts. It has not been for the faint-hearted, or who seek the fleshly pleasures. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the wasted genii, the creators of MAD things. For us, they toiled in sweatshops, endured the lash of the spanking. Time and again, these men struggled, and sacrificed, so that we might ... LIVE BETTER.\n\nWe remain the most powerful site on the Internet, our minds no less inventive, and services no less needed than they were last week, or yesterday, or the day before the day after tomorrow. Starting today, we must pull up our pants, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking Nico Nico Douga.\n\nNow, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest our server system cannot tolerate too many movies. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what Nico Nico already has done, what free men can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose.\n\nAnd so, to all the people who are reading this review, from the grandest cities, to the small villages where IKZO was born, know that Nico Nico is a friend to every man, who seeks the future of love and peace. Now we will begin to responsibly leave authorized common materials to Nico Nico people, and forge a hard-earned peace in this MAD world.\n\nWhat is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. This is the price, and the promise, of Nico NiCommons citizenship. Nico Nico Douga, in the face of common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words: A$$, WE CAN.\n\nLet it be said by our children's children, that when we were tested by DOS attacks, when we were refused by YouTube, that we did not turn back, nor did we falter, and we carried forth that great gift of freedom be delivered, and safely to future generations.\n\nThank you. God bless, and God bless Nico Nico Douga.", "votes_down": 13, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505890291, "timestamp_created": 1505890199, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "steamid": "76561198216413492", "num_reviews": 294, "num_games_owned": 3478, "last_played": 1506895628, "playtime_forever": 59}, "votes_up": 24, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35157795", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528049", "review": "I'm sorry. But it had to be done. I just couldn't allow this one to simply disappear from Steam - for reasons of, y'know, Copyright 'n' stuff - without briefly basking in its beauty. I had to get in quick, before the highly discerning boot of the Valve regime stomps on in and ruins all the fun.\n\n   Like anyone else, I've had regrets in my life. Who can blame me for not wanting to add THIS to that list? I might have kids one day: how could I look them in the eye and tell them that I didn't buy Deep Dark Fantasies when I had the chance?\n\n   So, the deed is done. How do I feel about my purchase, now that I've done the right thing and forked over my four dollaroonies?\n\n   ...\n\n   Okay, so it's shit. But any fool could see that much from several continents away.\n\n   \"This game is not recommended for children\" is the first thing I see, after boldly choosing the \"New game\" option from the menu. No shit, sherlock.\n\n   \"The game contains profanity, scenes of violence, and scenes of a sexual nature.\" Getting saucier by the second.\n\n   \"If you do not like anything - turn the game off NOW.\" Holy cremoly, this is starting to get scary. Have I accidentally stumbled onto the Deep Web or something?!\n\n   Buzzing synth music, and a heavily-pixelated pic of a shirtless dude in a bondage mask. THE ADVENTURE HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN.\n\n   Suffice it to say, the story which ensues probably won't win the Booker prize. But it IS a scintillating gem of gyms, \"bosses\", dungeons, \"Dungeon Masters\", and most importantly of all, men exerting their dominance over other men (in a beautiful and completely \"consenting adult\" kinda way, of course).\n\n   Seriously, how can you not love an interactive novel whose very first decision-making moment includes the option to - and I quote - \"Punish with your cock\"? And it just keeps getting Deeper and Darker, for all ten to fifteen minutes of \"gameplay\" which remain thereafter.\n\n    For anyone who found Harvester too sane and too tame for their liking, your game has finally arrived. There's no denying this game has BALLS. Big, hairy, manly BALLS. Are you man enough to face your Deep Dark Fantasies? Sissies need not apply...\n\nVerdict: 5/10 (I definitely \"learned\" something, and the synth music was actually pretty awesome and probably worth the purchase price alone).\n\n(PS Suffice it to say, I DID punish them with my cock. Those dirty slaves deserved nothing less for their desperate dungeon-escaping shenanigans.
