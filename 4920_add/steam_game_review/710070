This game completely understands and utilizes what made 90s horror games so nerve-racking. \n\nFrom the very beginning I was expecting jumpscares to be at the forefront of this title, given the contrast between settings in the screenshots, but I couldn't have been more wrong. It fully embraces its aesthetic and manipulates it in just the right way to give you a feeling of unease that gradually increases as you delve deeper into what's going on with this town. I felt a genuine dread with every level, and couldn't wait to see what awaited me as I continued onward. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just end with this: if you've ever been creeped out by a game that came out during the mid-90s, this will absolutely recapture whatever it is you felt. Buy this game.\n\nBravo to the developers.

I feel like theres a lack of a middle act where you're slowly uncovering what the hell is going on. Instead, it just escalates really quickly halfway through. I just wish there was more detective work to be done in this game before you ultimately get caught and thrown into whatever madness there is that is haunting the town. \n\nThat being said there are some lovely low-poly visuals going on here and some surprisingly challenging gameplay too.\nTake your time with this one and I think you'll have fun!", "votes_down": 2, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506701863, "timestamp_created": 1506701863, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 88, "steamid": "76561198067434431", "num_reviews": 5, "num_games_owned": 102, "last_played": 1506701064, "playtime_forever": 88}, "votes_up": 6, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
