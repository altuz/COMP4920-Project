One of my favorite games to play with friends- fun, fast paced, exciting, easy to learn, and the perfect amount of ridiculous to interest everyone watching! It's balanced really well- it's really easy to level the playing field completely and take the lead, with a well placed piece of dynamite and a trap. The environments are fun to explore, and have enough hidden secrets to keep even experienced players interested.", "votes_down": 0, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505250452, "timestamp_created": 1505250452, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198106592340", "num_reviews": 1, "num_games_owned": 22, "last_played": 1505250298, "playtime_forever": 9}, "votes_up": 1, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "35050746", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "review": "I last played the demo of this game quite a while ago and was happy to find a lot more content was added since then.\n\nThings that I liked:\n\n- Levels are large and encourage exploration. I was happy when I came across a pirate ship with a golden shark!\n- Throwing tiny cacti at the other player is always fun\n- Blowing up the bank and stealing all the gold\n- Placing bear traps and watching the other player get stuck \n- You can directly send feedback to the developers via the main menu\n\nThings that I disliked:\n\n- The controls take some time to learn. Since it's been a while, I had to re-learn them. I kept having to push random buttons and look down at my controller because I kept forgetting which did what. Then again, I skipped the tutorial.\n- I believe the interactions with the UI can be improved upon. Flow wise, some parts felt smooth while other interactions felt a little wonky.\n- I wish I could hold more than 4 objects at a time.\n- Requires two people to play\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to others.
