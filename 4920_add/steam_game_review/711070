But that's why I bought it!\nI spend my money so you don't have to!\n\nThe game is pretty interesting based on the current US vs North Korea situation, However it's a really basic memory game and is just repetitive. The achievements are 100, 50 in USA and 50 in North Korea. All you need to do is play the memory game 50 times in each of the selected countries.\n\nSkirmish however doesn't work at ALL. As soon as you click on it, The game pops up and error and suddenly the game crashed on me.\n\nI would not recommend until there's an update or they release something other than a memory game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzDGDq3rk9M", "votes_down": 4, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506908977, "timestamp_created": 1506908977, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "steamid": "76561198003384433", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1013, "last_played": 1506908744, "playtime_forever": 8}, "votes_up": 9, "voted_up": false}, {"recommendationid": "35398694", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427364", "review": "Starts with a somewhat amusing visual novel segment between leaders, followed by basic memory match game. Would suggest adding more 'chatter' between sides and perhaps change some of the tile-sets to break up the monotony of playing 50 rounds. North Koreans currently have a script error @29 which causes game to halt and no achievement given. Can't be recommended until a bug fix and without more variation it feels like a soulless grind.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1154854162", "votes_down": 7, "language": "english", "comment_count": "3", "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506899651, "timestamp_created": 1506898711, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "steamid": "76561197985036092", "num_reviews": 262, "num_games_owned": 10176, "last_played": 1507210280, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 10, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
