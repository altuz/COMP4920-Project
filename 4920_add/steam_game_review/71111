Yep, it's that old. Then in 1991 Sega  decided to bring it onto their fancy japanese modem for Sega Megadrive as one of the games that you could download, thus making a port, by Sega of Japan as well I belive. I am pretty sure that modem device couldn't hold big games, so they had to fill it in with small ones, like Flicky port. And probably quick ones too. \nAnd then they decided to bring it to the world outside of Japan as a physical release, 1 Megabit cartridge.\nAnd it all would have been awesome but I heard that it was priced too highly for budget title, what a nasty. So much for a budget title of game that was already considered ancient.\n\nThe game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.\n\n\nNow, for usual technical part about Sega's emulation here:\nThe Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for \"Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics\" game that should appear in your library.\nBy default it runs 3D bedroom Hub. Since emulator itself is based on 2006 one made in Java and 3D Hub is made in Unity, both famous for having not-good optimization, the performance in this hub varies from one PC to another. Sound lags as well.\nIt's recommended to run Simple Launcher, which can be done by Right Mouse Clicking the Sega Classic title in Steam library and selecting it. It still isn't perfectly accurate emulation, but it's acceptable. Sadly, it doesn't have user-friendly access to mods.\nHowever, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time! Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.\nAs alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Kinda like when people use ZDoom source port to run Doom on Steam. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in \"uncompressed ROMs\" folder that program itself doesn't use, the file for this one being \"FLICKY_UE.68K\".\nI also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. Go to \"manuals\" folder of game root and open \"FLICKY_PC_MG_EFIGS_US.pdf\".\n\n\nThis game stars Flicky, cute blue bird with red cheeks, on his quest to rescue Chirps, small yellow birdies, from the evil cats called Tigers, which are cutely enough called Nyannans in Japan by the way, and lizard Iggy. The game takes on 48 rounds, which are one-screen levels that loop horizontally, so you always see everything on screen. Just like early arcade games it actually loops levels again after that, albeit at higher difficulty, mostly speeding up enemies. Plus lizard at early levels. And with cosmetic changes on levels.\nBut hey, at least for Genesis version they actually added the credits sequens for the first 48 levels to congratulate you on being such a super player. That will do for removing title screen animation.\n\nYour mission is to take every Chirp on the level to the exit by touching them and leading them there. However, it's not easy as it sounds, because the two cats on the level are actively chasing you, looking all dumb and predictable until they decide to turn around out of blue. They all kill Flicky on a single contact, so you have to be careful. The lizard on other hand, which appears from Round 10, is just running around wall by himself, albeit he still defeats Flicky as well. The only nasty thing about him is that in order to cover every wall he occasionally runs over background vertically without any warning. Albeit it's pre-determinated on each level, so with memorization you know where he will go. Still, it's quite nasty, would have been better if there were some indication of where he will go vertically, like ropes.\nOne cat also speeds up if you take too long on a level. But then again, you are likely to take around 30 seconds per level. It's just such an amazing pick-up-play quickie game.\nArcade also had a cute-chubby-dragon that would smash window and shoot fireball at idle player. But hey, it was just \"get out from arcade cabinet then\" thing, so eh.\n\nAnd yep, graphics and sound/music were considered outdated even back then. Heck, they didn't manage to handle graphics of 7 year old arcade, there is less shading and thus cats are easily lost over the brown background. Music even seemed to annoy my ears at first, having headphones and all. Still, at least they redrew cats to make them more cute.\n\nOne of the things that keep this game from being bland is the way that Flicky controls. He is a bit slippery. He hovers down after jumping high slowly. He also bounces off the walls, which will throw off new players at first, but it seems to add to joy of momentum, somehow. It just feels so right and nice to control the heroine. You also isn't completely defenseless. You can pick up the item by passing near it and then throw it by pressing jump button. Which is the only action aside from D-Pad that this game uses, making it as good as Sonic, har har. But yep, it's not set to separate button or anything. Unlike Wonder Boy or early Mario games where they set projectile throwing onto run button was just a wayaround over limited controllers (and I think that Nintendo kept it for Super Mario World from what I remember, showing that they hate players) in Flicky it means that you can't just walk anywhere you want weapon-ready. Gotta use them more wisely.\n\nAnd another thing that this arcade game does so well is making you risk more for bigger reward. You get a huge amount of score if you complete level in 20 seconds. Or if you beat bonus stage perfectly, where you catch Chirks as Nyannans throw them up into air from their see-saws. Or if you carry all the Chirps at once to the exit which is harder to do as Nyannans will break the lines of Chirps that they touch and Chirps with sunglasses will blindly run into single directions once broken away. And the only way that you get additional lives is by reaching sertain scores. Lives are very valuable, as you get only 2-3 (depends on how you count \"zero lives left\") of them and no continues, so you want to play it riskier. And sometime you want to take a more careful approach.\n\nWell, it almost works if forget that Sega decided to have only 5 additional lives that you can earn by scoring, that you get halfway through the game, so that's eh.\nStill, if you do real good then a bikini girl will appear behind window on certain level, wagging her back around, so there we go, the ultimate motivator to git gud.\nFunny that Arcade had more innocent animation of girl waving her hand at window. But hey, you should have seen ads in 90s.\n\nI will tell you this though - Flicky is no joke. Let me tell you an average dialogue with friend:\n- Games nowdays are made for people with limited 30fps brain capalities and their moms. They are never going to capture the overwhelming greatness of Planescape: Torment that requires REAL force of will without any handholding and only HARDCORE can appreciate maturity of Deus Ex with no cover regerations that all the puppies nowadays can't stop sucking up to. The way that Resident Evil 4 was casualized with infinite saving makes me rage! \n- Fam, chill, you aren't like yourself unless you play arcade game. Here, take Flicky.\n- Oh, my, god, there are CATS ON SEESAWS! *Death from cute. And from awesome arcade gameplay.*\n[i]Dialogue is fully fictional, no responsibilities will be taken, your friend might be a horrible person who can't open his heart.[/i]\n\nOverall, early addictive arcade classic.
