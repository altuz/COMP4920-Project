Anyways, hope next time give us, something related to the game itself, like it's soundtrack, a demo, a special feature and not an old 2 dollar game."}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502846131, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481050", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "34267240", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094702875", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1502846052, "num_games_owned": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 8}, "timestamp_updated": 1502846131, "received_for_free": true, "review": "i got this for free because sonic mania got delayed\n10/kingy is gay"}]}
