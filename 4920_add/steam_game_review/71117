There also has been an update where SEGA Genesis & Mega Drive collection now has a new menu instead of a simplistic menu. The old menu is now known as \"Simple Launcher\". Only use that if you are unable to launch your games correctly on the new launcher.\n\nGunstar Heroes is quite the game for me. It came from a Japanese game company not many knew at the time, Treasure. \n\nTo take a quote from Wikipedia;\n[quote=Wikipedia]Treasure Co., Ltd. (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30c8\u30ec\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc Kabushiki-gaisha Torej\u0101?) is a Japanese video game developer, by former employees of Konami on June 19, 1992. Treasure is best known for classic-style action games that employ innovative gameplay systems. Their greatest commercial successes have been games like Wario World and Mischief Makers, but they are better known for their critical successes, such as Sin and Punishment, Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, Alien Soldier, Guardian Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, Bangai-O, and Ikaruga. Their first released game was Gunstar Heroes, although McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure was developed first.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_(company)[/quote]\n\nWhen it came to Treasure, only three games came in mind as favorites. Gunstar Heroes (the game I'll be reviewing today), Ikaruga (A game I might talk about in a later date), and Astro Boy: Omega Factor (a game I felt needed more love and attention than it deserved, especially for a GBA game).\n\n\nGunstar Heroes is a Run & Gun Shooter which released in late 1993 on the Sega Genesis. The game managed to obtain many ports including the Game Gear by M2, the Playstation 2 as part of the \"Gunstar Heroes: Treasure Box Collection\", the Wii's Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, Playstation Network (with Online Co-Op), a port on Steam as part of the SEGA Genesis and Mega Drive Collection, and finally a \"3D Classics\" version on the Nintendo 3DS E-Shop.\n\nThe story is very different than the Japanese and Interntional versions of the game, but both stories have some things in common. A god-like Android by the name of [i]Golden Silver[/i] was sealed away by the [i]Gunstar[/i] family (Consisting of Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green) as it had the potential to cause extreme ruin to the Earth, and potentially the universe. It was sealed away by taking the [i]four gems[/i] Golden Silver uses as it's power source and hid them away so no one could awaken this destructive robot. However, the vicious dictator [i]Colonel Red[/i] (called \"General Gray\" in the Japanese storyline) used a mind control machine to take control of [i]Gunstar Green[/i] and use him to find the gems. Now he plans to use the gems in hopes to reactivate Golden Silver, who Red falsely believes to be a bringer of utopia. Along with [i]Dr. Brown[/i] (a kind old man who believed the Gunstar Family's claims of Golden Silver not being a peacekeeping god and has went against the Empire), the remaining members of the Gunstar family go through a last ditch plan to prevent the resurrection of Golden Silver by reclaiming the Gems which Red has left his commanders in charge of (including the mind-controlled Green).\n\nThe game functions as a side scrolling shooter. When you start the game, you'll be given the choice between Free Shot and Fixed Shot (note that Gunstar Red is Free Shot on default and Gunstar Blue is Fixed Shot on default). You'll also be given a choice of four weapons: Force (a powerful shot that fires rapidly), Lightning (a straight shot that fires through enemies), Chaser (a shot that homes onto enemies), and Flame (a shot that's effective with close range). These four weapons can be combined to create a total of an additional 10 weapons for a grand total of 14 weapons in the game. An example being if you combine Lightning and Chaser, you can create a lightning beam attack that homes onto enemies..which pretty much breaks the entire game (especially in Co-Op). In addition to these weapons, you can take on your enemies in close combat. You can grab, toss, body slam, and slide into your enemies to kill them.\nFor every level you beat, Red and Blue's starting health goes up by 20, giving the game a feel of progression. Quite similar to the Heart Capsules from Mega Man X, except you don't find them in a level, but rather beat the level itself to gain it.\nThe game is also local Co-Op (online is an option if you have the PlayStation Network version).\n\nThere are many differences between this game and other side scrolling shooters. The first difference being your health is displayed in numbers. The second is the previously mentioned weapon system the game offers. The third is that you have unlimited continues. The fourth difference is that when you get a game over (which in this game is triggered upon on your death), you are either given the option to start at the beginning of the level or just end the game. The last difference are the boss encounters you face. The game gets intense when they come around, and they can put a good amount of pressure on you. Whether they be the boss at the end of a level, or just the first mini-boss the level has to offer. One can easily say the boss encounters are the main highlight of this game.\n\nThe game has been highly praised mainly for the \"dazzling graphics\", \"amazing visuals\", and \"fantastic boss encounters\". It also made use of 3D models for some bosses, resulting in some unique boss battles. While not that many people point it out, the soundtrack does sound good from a retro viewpoint. None of the tracks feel bland to me, and they all seem to work for their situation.\n\nMy opinion on this game? It's a must have for those who wish to plunge back into the retro times of gaming, where SEGA were still rivals with Nintendo, and many titles have yet to see their arrival onto the world of 3D such as the likes of Mario, Sonic, Link, Rayman, or even PAC-MAN. The game itself isn't that expensive, only priced around 3$. While it may not be as long as other games such as the likes of Sonic 3 & Knuckles, I certainly had a blast with this title from a company I have loved from my childhood."}]}
