I never knew what choice would result in what changes to my character, and sometimes the opposite happened of what I wanted, even on multiple playthroughs trying to play a certain way.

In actual fact, it is certainly more than 10 hours already, and I am currently on my third playthrough. Why does it take so long to complete it? Not only because it has a very substantial story, but also for the reason that I read almost everything, even on my subsequent playthroughs. Yes, even the text I've seen trice already. I don't usually reread novels, interactive or regular ones, - at least, not unless a sufficient amount of time has passed. However, \"The Academy\" is too much of a joy to read. Even on my third playthrough, I still keep noticing and appreciating small things that eluded my attention during the first and the second ones. Some scenes and interactions that I didn't consider to be something special and didn't pay a lot of attention to back then \u2013 now acquire special meaning (like the first encounter with Aurion, when he still is in the queue, but already has some problem with the Academy's staff; I might be wrong, and my supposition was never confirmed nor disproved within the novel itself, at least as far as I've seen... but I think that this hassle is one of the hints at Aurion's real origin \u2013 that, in his narrative, he was meant to be a protagonist. His bio matches the profile of a traditional fantasy hero perfectly: born in a small town in a middle of nowhere, coming from a fortuneless family... having a very, extremely ordinary appearance. If his designated role in the narrative really was the role of protagonist, then the scene at the beginning of the novel makes perfect sense. To make a face-heel turn is not forbidden per se, so Aurion was told that he has nothing to be afraid of, if he really is a person he described himself as in his application. However, there could always be a possibility that he was a mole, who just pretended to turn to the dark side and who planned to undermine the studying process from the inside. So, it would explain the need of additional verification). \n\nSpeaking about the characters, every interaction with them (or their interactions with each other) is a damn TREASURE. I saw the reviews, in which people said that the characters are cliched and one-dimensional. I think, these people kinda... missed the whole point. \"The Academy\" is a very meta story, the story about a narrative itself; here, the most common tropes of traditional (and not-so-traditional) narrative are evoked. Sometimes they played straight, sometimes they are subverted, or inverted, or deconstructed. Sometimes they are used ironically, sometimes \u2013 not so; however, what I want to say, they are [i]played with[/i], and it is a very significant part of what makes this novel so good. Every character here is based on one or two fundamental tropes, but always \u2013 with an extremely clever twist. Or two. Or three. They break out of their designated roles in their unique fashions, and \u2013 ohgod, it is just so, so thrilling and amusing to observe them doing their things, reacting, being themselves. I am very, very NOT indifferent about every one of them, although still have my favourites. sdfksledf AURION. His interactions with Xi are precious, his interaction with Phil are precious, his interactions with MC are precious, and his interactions with THE WORLD IN WHOLE are so precious it hurts. I don't even know, whether I should laugh or cry half of the time, when he appears in the story; to think about it, his situation is kinda tragic. And when he fails at something, it is always both painful and hilarious. The way he respects the ones who were evil to him and made his life a bit (or a lot) more awful, because by doing so they embody the ideals Aurion believes in, is very amusing and fascinating, and, well, fun to watch. But it also pains to watch him fail, because he deserves to succeed and to get what he wants more than anyone. He worked so, so hard towards it, and he was damn smart about it. Such determination, drive, intelligence and capability should be rewarded! With something good. However, unfortunately, he has a fundamental aversion to \"good\". And he would also hate to be viewed as sympathetic. :D \nNot to mention the fact that, working so much on being evil, more than anyone in the Academy, apparently (may be, even more than anyone in the history of the Academy), - he still doesn't really succeeds in it. He talks so much about bringing pain and destruction, being treacherous and cruel, but achieves his exceptional grades almost entirely through honest studying, and, apparently, is not even capable of a proper betrayal. He had every opportunity for backstabbing, but preferred to announce his intentions, even if that meant putting himself at disadvantage. It looks to me like he couldn't escape his protagonist origin, no matter how hard he tried. What an unfortunate fellow. T__T xD \n\nBut enough about that, or I'm going to bump into the word-limit. I just want to highlight again: for me, it is a very special CoG, and I consider it a work of pure brilliance. Clever, inventive, witty, genre-bending, giving the player vast opportunities for role-playing, choosing sides, switching sides (if MC changed their mind for some reason). There is a lot to uncover in the story: to learn more about its characters, to learn more about the MC themselves, to learn more about the conflict between their mother and professor Cerebrist, to be entangled deeper in the war within the Academy, to determine what it means to be a villain... At all times, I felt engrossed into the story, emotionally involved; I felt like the decisions of the MC were meaningful and consequential, and were to be taken seriously \u2013 but still there always were enough freedom to choose how to proceed in the way I thought viable and in-character, and not everything was about the MC and revolved around them. The world of this novel is alive, and the characters would take their actions, even when there is no MC to see them and to influence them; however, the MC plays a very satisfying part in everything that happens and has their means to influence the course of events and the actions of other characters \u2013 within the boundaries dictated by their personalities, of course. In both of my complete playthroughs, I also felt that my characters changed during the course of events. Not because I failed to make the choices that the people with their personalities would make, but because the experience of living through the events and interacting with other characters influenced them and changed their worldview and behaviour. And this is the best possible journey through the story. It feels substantial, significant and satisfying. I loved the experience. \n\n10/10, and the title of one of the two most favourite CoGs and HGs of all time (and I played more than a half of the whole existing bunch).", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505985538, "timestamp_created": 1505985512, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "steamid": "76561198072628589", "num_reviews": 2, "num_games_owned": 89, "last_played": 1505985275, "playtime_forever": 20}, "votes_up": 3, "voted_up": true}, {"recommendationid": "34966414", "received_for_free": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506573", "review": "This COG game exact like Hosted Games release Community College Hero but centralised around villains.

Lot of character development for the main character but the same could not be said for other characters. Some side characters lack depth as their motives were not clearly mentioned especially differences between choosing modern or old villainism.
