I firmly believe this developer however shows strong game design skills in this game and I hope that we see future games from him here on Steam which utilize other game engines!  \n\nNot recommended.  Value is very poor with No power-ups, no AI besides a small variety of spiders, no different weapons to collect, no money or collectibles of any kind, and the boredom quickly sets in.  There is simply MUCH better top down indie shooters available for much less money here on Steam.  The Ubermosh series and Splatter: Zombie Apocalypse are two quick examples.", "votes_down": 3, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506065841, "timestamp_created": 1506057519, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "steamid": "76561198053422627", "num_reviews": 292, "num_games_owned": 960, "last_played": 1506044979, "playtime_forever": 112}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
