If so, do not buy this game. You will literally be swarmed by virtual butterflies.  They are all over the place and pop in and out of your view.  However, if you are not afraid of butterflies then listen up.\n\nI do recommend this game and I think it was priced correctly at $1.99 (and even better on sale for $1.49).  Keep in mind, there's not a lot of \"gameplay\" here.  This is a artistically inspired VR nature experience.  This game has one of the most beautifully rendered artistic nature VR environments, both stylistic and audibly.  This world is so beautiful that you just want to stay here and ignore the butterflies as much as possible.  The trees actually move with the breeze.  The sky, the water, the flowers, the sounds of nature, are all so absolutely gorgeous and the mountain backdrop to this island paradise just give you a I want to live here forever feeling.  I wish this game environment was used as a Zelda clone RPG where you can move about freely and do some questing.  Somebody please make this happen.\n\nYou can move in the game as far as your roomscale allows, but you are transported to the different areas by holding down the grip button.  You need to catch enough butterflies to be able to experience the new area (I believe it's 100 butterflies for each zone).  There are a total of six areas to experience.  Each area has a very beautiful, idyllic view.  However, other than the butterflies and the moving water and swaying trees, there's no other critters or insects or weather or anything else moving or breathing.  The nature sounds are misleading.  You can only interact with the butterflies via your net.\n\nNow the bad stuff about this game. As mentioned above, you are swarmed by butterflies.  There's just too many of them spawning all over the place.  And they all look EXACTLY the same.  Purple.  Now, granted some of them have 1 wings versus 2 wings, but that's a \"bug\" not a feature (pun intended).  Some variety to these butterflies would be nice.  Also, it's just not fun having to catch 100 or so butterflies to unlock the next zone, you can literally hold your hand out and it'll happen eventually.  I would suggest the dev cut down the spawn rate by like 75% or higher for the butterflies, and maybe instead of 100 butterflies, just catch the \"golden\" butterfly or \"rainbow\" butterfly to unlock the next area.\n\nI think this game is mostly geared for families, especially kids.  So, I have two suggestions to improve this family experience.  First suggestion, let us see our hands.  I know I wanted to be able to put by hand out in space and have a butterfly land on my finger (the Oculus Touch tutorial does this!).  I bet kids would also love this.  Second suggestion, when you catch a butterfly with the net, how about not having it disappear into thin air?  I think a better mechanic would be for the butterfly to turn into a silver glowing thing and fly away OR have the ability to put it in a jar.  Putting it in a jar would go along great with catching the special type of butterfly suggestion.  Either thing would be better than just having it vanish when it's caught by the net.\n\nRating 6/10 and 7/10 when all the \"bugs\" are fixed ;)\n\np.s.
