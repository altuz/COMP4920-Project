Yep, a sequel, albiet the developers got to make two SF games on Game Gear before this. Still 'casual' due no permadeath. Made by Camelot known as Sonic Co. when they worked for Sega. Came out in 1993 in Japan, got to the West in 1994. 16 Megabit ROM, 2 in-same save slots.\n\nThe game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version. Western version that for some reason disabled ability to search chests during battles so you can't get some items or ambushes. At least nothing important. Allows to immeditly choose difficulty too.\n\n\nNow, for usual technical part about Sega's emulation here:\nThe Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for \"Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics\" game that should appear in your library.\nBy default it runs 3D bedroom Hub. Since emulator itself is based on 2006 one made in Java and 3D Hub is made in Unity, both famous for having not-good optimization, the performance in this hub varies from one PC to another. Sound lags as well.\nIt's recommended to run Simple Launcher, which can be done by Right Mouse Clicking the Sega Classic title in Steam library and selecting it. It still isn't perfectly accurate emulation, but it's acceptable. Sadly, it doesn't have user-friendly access to mods.\nHowever, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time! Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.\nAs alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Kinda like when people use ZDoom source port to run Doom on Steam. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in \"uncompressed ROMs\" folder that program itself doesn't use, the file for this one being \"SHINING2_U.68K\".\nI also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. Go to \"manuals\" folder of game root and open \"09 SF2_PC_MG_EFIGS_US_v6.pdf\".\nOf course you better find original US manual since it's RPG and all. Or some FAQ.\n\nAnd yep, this game includes saving. In-game saving, not emulator one. But you have to remember, you have to close emulator in proper way, otherwise it will not have them actually saved in files. That means that you have to avoid crashing it or closing in different way.\nEven more, if you load emulator-side saves, the emulator will not see in-game saves and will not be able to do in-game saves either. Even if it makes look as if it does, it will not save into file.\n\n\nThe plot of the is a separate event from SF1, different characters and region. Story is actually more interesting to follow this time, pretty good for 16-bit. If only it didn't have a forced princess love clich\u00e9, aha.\nTranslation also wasn't too bad but for some reason they changed \u201cLucifer\u201d to \u201cDark Dragon\u201d, retconning SF1.\nProtip: There is a secret non-canon battle after credits. Have patience.\n\nYou get to select four difficulties. Ouch is supposed to have better AI than Hard that is supposed to have better AI than Normal, but players aren't able to tell a difference. What matters is that in Super, which supposedly has Hard AI, every enemy gets +25% more to attack stats. That's the hardest.\n\nThe big improvement in this game is game engine. Your character is now more responsible, the shops tell who can equip item and stat changes, if hero has full inventory then items automatically go to other Force members, C button for interaction without menu. Enemies movement is faster during battles. It will be hard to come back to SF1 after this.\nProtip: Some late-game equipment have magic use. Must be equipable but don't have to be equiped.\nProtip: Some cursed items are a good tradeoff.\n\nAlso, in order to grab some items late-game you have to use A \u2192 Search command instead of C button. No idea why, game was sorta rushed.\n\nThe core gameplay isn't too different. You once again find the new members for your Force by exploring inbetween the battles, visiting shops to buy better weapon or fill with items, opening up chests and finding permanent stat-boosting items. It still has the same usual jolly jRPG elements. It now has open world too Well, still linear progression, but you can always backtrack or get lost on the land. I suggest looking at overworld map in original US manual or find a JP poster. I guess it's cool. There are filler overworld battles in some spots. While you are required to beat them the first time you can have them repeat at random if you pass the same spot. They will help if you happen to have underleveled character as almost no XP is given on weak attacks but otherwise they will annoy you. At least you can Egress, magic for escaping, and they don't happen often.\nProtip: If you are getting owned by Kraken then then go explore to south-west land at river fork.\n\nAs for battles themselves, there are no big innovations. 12 members in battles. Grid. Lose if main hero dies at which point you are sent to last priest with half of your gold missing, while keeping all XP so you can't get stuck. No defninite turns order. I do feel that they tried to balance the game out. Most of hard counters softened up: your mages aren't going to die so easily and your front line forces aren't going get too much defence. As long as you don't grind, that is. Magic that enemy mages use is more consistent. Gotta set your formation accordingly. The people you meet aren't underleveled, albeit pre-promoted after some point.\nProtip: Mages have defence against the same magic type that they use. Hit Freeze users with Blaze!\n\nAI are much smarter than SF1 ones. They aren't going to be satisfied with sitting on same spot while taking arrows to the knee. I do think that that tactics got a bit samey. Don't know, they always react in same way no matter the map. SF1 AI, albeit dumb, still was less predictable on first play, scripted to go along with map. But bosses are much better this time for sure. No regenerating health but more agressive. The lack of perma-death actually is at best here, as you will be throwing your pawns as bosses eat those up like sunflower seeds, while your favourites are doing the real job. I actually beat a few with only few members remaining.\nProtip: Equipping items during battles wastes no turn. Don't be afraid to switch between lances and spears on centaurs!\n\nHeroes now gain stats until level 40 and you can promote with level 20. Promotion doesn't cut down stats this time, some exceptions aside. Still resets your level count to 1 and allows you to use high-end equipment. Main focus is not when you promote but to which class as you can find the hidden items that allow alt promotion. For example, you can promote Healers to Vicar for bigger MP or you can promote to Master Monks to get a healing murder booty. I recommend promoting at Level 25 or earlier. More and it will be too easy on non-Super.\nProtip: Pay attention to find blacksmith town near end of game that accepts mithrills.\n\nAh yep, and you still get awesome animations for any interaction during the battle. Using items or punching knights into face. Also, multiple music track depending on who does the action, great! Nothing as perfect as SF1 one tho. And they added a chance to get a weak counter-attack.\nProtip: Healers now get XP even when healing zero damage. Use it to level em. Give support classes finishing hits on enemies too.\n\nThey technically improved graphics albeit overworld graphics still have that 8-bit feel. It still has the sweet western-japanese fantasy tale art style of original however it now leans more toward anime. Some chars have baby face potraits! The music is really good this time, less repetitive. Sound effects in battle sadly are so muffled and unappealing you might mistake it for SNES game.\n\nYou can have sorta multiplayer with cheat that allows controlling opponent if you don't mind passing controller around. Of course it's not balanced at all!\n\nA pretty good sequel!"}]}
