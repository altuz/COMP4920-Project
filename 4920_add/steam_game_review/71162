Play as Knuckles and you play along HIS routes which are separate from the first two and get a different side of the story.\n\nOh did I mention Tails can fly and swim? That means if you have a friend, you can do co-op, Tails will sadly get left behind a lot, but there are times where your friend can fly you around the levels.

They have taken everything that was great about Sonic 2 and just made it that bit better. The level design is excellent, the switchable gravity in the death egg zone is especially fun even if it is a bit of a mind fuck. Each of the playable characters have their own special abilities and Knuckles has a different final boss fight too. Also having different types of shield is a very nice addition to the game. Yet despite all that it is probably Sonic 2 that I am going to come back to for nostalgia's sake.
