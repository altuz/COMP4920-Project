Having played the original countless times on the SEGA Megadrive since the age of 3, I was extremely delighted to find the port to Steam. The gameplay is just as good as it was back then, bringing a fantastic feeling of nostalgia. I used to play the game with my twin brother and my Dad as a kid, providing an amazing local co-op experience. Replaying it with a friend brought back many memories as I relived my childhood on the Streets of Rage.\n\nPros:\n+ Simple controls\n+ Local co-op\n+ Gamepad support (I used a PS3 controller)\n+ A feeling of nostalgia\n+ Pixel art graphics (I love them)\n\nCons:\n- Too easy to accidentally grab your co-op partner\n- Still contains some glitches (was thrown by both wrestler bosses at the same time on Stage 8, throwing me out of the screen and completing the game)\n- I disliked the level design of Stage 6 where squashing machinery takes up too much space on the screen making it annoying to fight in.\n\nScore: 7/10"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1320926044, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516766", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "1009833", "votes_up": 21, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984298258", "num_reviews": 58, "last_played": 0, "num_games_owned": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 0}, "timestamp_updated": 1320926044, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Streets of Rage was a pretty tough game, grab a friend, it is fun to play."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1482595363, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521108", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28600258", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043782587", "num_reviews": 336, "last_played": 1464374388, "num_games_owned": 1377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 27}, "timestamp_updated": 1482595369, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Streets of Rage is a 2 player beat-em-up game for Sega Genesis that was released in 1991 as a response to Capcom's Final Fight and it's SNES port, following the same formula of core gameplay: grappling and such. Final Fight on SNES was 1 player only, so it wasn't hard to be cool despite having smaller less impressive sprites. SoR is known as Bare Knuckle in Japan and it was developed by Sega AM7 team in Sega of Japan. At least it's probably same people who made Revenge of Shinobi, since it reuses some sounds from there.  Released on 4 Megabit ROM, quite standard for it's time.\nSega also made Game Gear and Master System versions back in time. They are nothing to talk about, just worsened/cut around. On other hand, quite recently they released 3D Streets of Rage for 3DS, which adds 3D and some easy modes. That one is superior version.\n\nThe game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.\n\n\nNow, for usual technical part about Sega's emulation here:\nThe Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for \"Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics\" game that should appear in your library.\nBy default it runs 3D bedroom Hub. Since emulator itself is based on 2006 one made in Java and 3D Hub is made in Unity, both famous for having not-good optimization, the performance in this hub varies from one PC to another. Sound lags as well.\nIt's recommended to run Simple Launcher, which can be done by Right Mouse Clicking the Sega Classic title in Steam library and selecting it. It still isn't perfectly accurate emulation, but it's acceptable. Sadly, it doesn't have user-friendly access to mods.\nHowever, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time! Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.\nAs alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Kinda like when people use ZDoom source port to run Doom on Steam. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in \"uncompressed ROMs\" folder that program itself doesn't use, the file for this one being \"STREETS_W.68K\".\nI also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. Go to \"manuals\" folder of game root and open \"08 SOR1_PC_MG_EFIGS_US_v6.pdf\".\n\nWhile the game has multiplayer mode for two players, the emulator doesn't have any online function for that, so it's local only.\n\n\nNot unlike Final Fight, the plot is about people on revenge going to beat up punks and criminal syndicate that have taken over the city. Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding, who are around ~22 age old ex-cops, are ready to put order back in. While being helped by a cop who has access to heavy equipment, who can be called as a special screen-clearing attack, making him shoot from bazooka at the area. And yea, you have limited amount of usage for that. Actually, it seems that they reused the sprite for police car from ESWAT ending. So in my headcanon these games are related!\n\nSetting is kinda similar to Final Fight, but it's seems to be, well, how do I say, romantized. The action always takes at night, you see lights in background of the nameless city that you don't even know the edges of or the full picture of it. And the music is absolutely top-notch. It's club music, written by Yuzo Koshiro, proving that sound chip in Sega Genesis really rocked. Screams are sweet.\n\nYou can select between three characters. They are set up so Axel isn't as good at jumping, Adam is slower and Blaze has lesser attack power. They all have the same playstyle, at least there is no difference in moves that they can pull off, unlike later games. However, you will still will notice some other differences, such as Adam having the most range with pipe weapons or Axel not being able to throw away enemies as far.\n\nThe gameplay is, of course, a beat-em-up. As usual, you can move up-down, as in, deeper into camera direction or opposite, while being able to attack only left and right. It's pretty much a beat-em-up of Final Fight school. Moving in/out-depth for avoiding isn't as important as it would be in previous games of this genre, for example. It's all due to attack collision being this much wider, but the AI of enemies allows a more straight-forward approach as well. Not to say that it such avoiding doesn't work, just comparing. AI of enemies in SoR1 isn't too simple, but possible annoying, as they often keep distance out of your range, taking some time before approaching you. Don't bother trying to get them outside of the edge of a screen, the attack collision doesn't work there.\n\nOh yea, and of course when you get close to the enemy you automatically grab them. After that you can punch them few times. Or throw them back with back+punch, even though this one sometimes just makes you ungrab and walk away. Or you can smash their head against ground from behind, the most powerful move. And thrown enemies knock others, which does good damage.\nAlso, all yay for some levels having pits. Pre-last level is just an open lift. It's a blast!\nThere aren't any much of special moves otherwise.\n\nAnd yea, and there are weapons that you can pick up. What I love about the first Streets of Rage is that unlike the second one you don't lose them when you try to grab somebody and unlike the third one their \u201chealth\u201d consists of \u201cyou can drop them from being knocked out 2 times before they disappear\u201d instead of being limited by usage amount. It feels so awesome to be good enough to bring weapons all the way to the boss fight!\nOh yea, and there is no way to throw weapon. There is a knife, which does great damage and it can be thrown, but the game decides when to do it by itself. I think you need either to be not directly in same line as enemy or be far away.\n\nIf anything, I feel that the main difficulty of this game comes not from regular encounters but from tricky bosses. Regular encounters are usually not too bad, aside from control issues where you want to punch enemy but you are standing over the weapon and pick it instead. Or just grab the enemy due to having too many around. It's all about the bosses .\nProtip 1: Press Up+Jump when thrown as you are about to land. You will land on your feet without taking damage.\nProtip 2: Pay attention to shadows of Level 5 bosses as well. It's easier to tell how deep away from camera they are.\n\nThere are also options menu. There are usual controls and sound test. Don't get too addicted to sound test, you still should play the game. And there is difficulty level, which impacts the amount of health that enemies have, damage they do as well. Their amount is also changed slightly. Though the amount of score you get at the end of the level is increased on higher difficulty, which is pretty nice as you get lives for scores.\n\nThe game also has 2 player coop mode. It's one of the beat-em-up where you have friendly fire in coop, so be careful. Actually, the game also adds more enemies and even stationary objects that you can break for goodies. It makes you always fight two copies of bosses instead of one, something that not even difficulty setting does.\nIt even has team attacks. They are related to grabbing your teammate. You either have to throw him away or jump over him forward. These moves aren't easy to hit with, but they do a huge damage on regular enemies.\n\nThere is also a bad ending that you can get only in two player mode. At final boss, where he asks you a question, both players have to choose different replies. After that players will be forced to fight each other, which is fancy. And then the winner still has to answer \u201cno\u201d as per usual about joining organization. And then win the game.\nAlso, never answer \u201cyes\u201d to final boss otherwise, you are just going to be dropped two levels back. Which isn't fun. At all.\n\nOverall, it sure was an awesome game for it's time. And I still love it to this day."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1344277140, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509144", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "605067", "votes_up": 12, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972822414", "num_reviews": 309, "last_played": 0, "num_games_owned": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 0}, "timestamp_updated": 1344277140, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The side scrolling beat 'em up is a genre that I do miss.
