It was made by Ancient, Yuzo Koshiro's company, which I belive to be the main developer, along with Sega of Japan and some \u201cShout! Ow\u201d that I have no idea about. Released at the end of 1992, to make it the best X-Mas gift for kids along with Sonic 2. It also came as pack-in title with some consoles. It came on 16 Megabit ROM. It actually was made a big deal of, as it was the first game for Sega Mega Drive to be this big (in West). Looking at how huge character were compared to SoR1, it sure made a great impression. If you wonder, the previous big deal was port of Strider with the first ever 8 MEGAPOWER!\nIt had some ports. 8-bit Sega is of course inferior, albeit quite different. On another hand, 3DS port is the one you should seek.\n\nThe game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.\n\n\nNow, for usual technical part about Sega's emulation here:\nThe Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for \"Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics\" game that should appear in your library.\nBy default it runs 3D bedroom Hub. Since emulator itself is based on 2006 one made in Java and 3D Hub is made in Unity, both famous for having not-good optimization, the performance in this hub varies from one PC to another. Sound lags as well.\nIt's recommended to run Simple Launcher, which can be done by Right Mouse Clicking the Sega Classic title in Steam library and selecting it. It still isn't perfectly accurate emulation, but it's acceptable. Sadly, it doesn't have user-friendly access to mods.\nHowever, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time! Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.\nAs alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Kinda like when people use ZDoom source port to run Doom on Steam. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in \"uncompressed ROMs\" folder that program itself doesn't use, the file for this one being \"STREETS2_U.68K\".\nI also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. Go to \"manuals\" folder of game root and open \"04 SOR2_PC_MG_EFIGS_US_v6.pdf\".\n\nWhile the game has multiplayer mode for two players, the emulator doesn't have any online function for that, so it's local only.\n\n\nSo, what's the big idea behind this sequel? Well, that's simple: Street Fighter 2 came out not long time ago and it blew the game industry up. It was a post-SF2 world and people were now taking lessons from it. In this case, Ancient brought the feel of combos and fighting into SoR, as well as making each character feel unique, pulling off different moves on same control input. And yep, they were successful! You can feel an impact of each hit, the sound is right, the speed of animation is right. They made SoR2 to be a bit slower paced than SoR1, but I am pretty sure you are going to stop caring as soon as you beat your first punk.\n\nThen again, if you set it to highest difficulty, you will barely manage to get space and breath time from all the enemies attacks. And the AI of them also was changed. They are less annoying, not trying hard as much of staying out of your range like in SoR1. You know, they don't hide outside of screen edges anymore.\n\nActually, the game took super specials from Final Fight, where characters do crowd control move which makes them lose a small amount of health, instead of ESWAT car bombing everything. It does add a bit of strategy into game and it allows you to get out from enemies grab. Always worth using if you feel you are about to beat up, the health punishment is tiny.\nProtip: To land onto your feet when thrown press Up+Jump.\n\nAnd there are four characters now, all having their own game style. You also get to change them between continues when you lose all lives. There are veterans Axel and Blaze. Adam was made into princess in peril because having three similar playstyles were deemed as too much. Blaze playes like SoR1. Axel is now thin legged and wearing cool jeans, with a ability to spam Dragon Punch sorta move on forward-forward-punch that I keep hearing as \u201cGRANDPAPA\u201d, being the best all-around character. Max is not unlike SF2 Zangief. He is slow, but once he gets his gorilla paws on punk, he will do great damage. Skate, on another hand, is radical in another way: fast yet weak. He is the only character who can dash. Sadly, he is too weak overall. The thing that annoys me the most is how unpolished dashing is. Did you know that if you want to dash in opposite direction, then you will have to press into that direction not two, but three times!\n\nAnd while the game is totally awesome, with varied stages (there are few per level) and great bosses that don't feel gimmicky and feel a bit more like natural fight. However, I am not amused with how weapons were handled. For some reason, developers have decided that protagonist has to drop the weapon when he (accidently) grabs an enemy. And yes, that means that weapon's health takes a hit, as it can be dropped only 3 times. Ouch!\n\nThrowable weapons that are knives and kunai are also way too weak. They are about as strong as a single punch even when thrown. Knives are worthless, Nothing like in SoR1.\n\nAnd yea, characters use weapons a bit differently. Just range and speed thing. Skate is too slow with pipes and such, you can see him sweat. Max is so cool, he hits with pipes anybody behind him. And Blaze is special case with knife, doing three-hit with them that is so slow that once again I would rather not pick knives up.\nProtip: To throw weapons, press Punch+Jump. Better hold Punch and then press Jump.\n\nAnd yep, graphics are mind-blowing in this game when compared to RoS1! Character sizes have more than doubled, the animation is even richer! It has a cartoonish-anime art style as well. And they finally show the health of enemies too, ha! The music is as delightful as ever and is half the reason why the game is so addictive, all yay Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima.\nAnd despite having all the huge sprites, it can actually pull off having up to 6 enemies at same time on a screen even in two player mode, without flickers or huge slowdowns. And SNES people say that Blast Processor isn't real, ha!\n\nAnd yep, there is options settings. There is usual sound test. You can also set amount of lives you have and difficulty, which impacts a lot of things: such as damage, reaction of enemies, health of bosses, even their amount at times.\nBy the way, here is a fancy thing: if you beat the game on hardest, the game will tell you a cheat code, which also gives \u201cmania\u201d difficulty!\n\nAnd yep, there is also a 2 player multiplayer. You can either play with your fam in coop through the main game or do the duel not unlike Golden Axe. In cooperative you don't collide with each other, but there is friendly fire, so watch out. There is also no team moves like in SoR1. Should be fun however! The game does give more health items when you start with two players. Occasionally doubling mini-bosses too.\nAs for duel, ehhhh, it's still not SF2, despite being inspired by it. Though it does get a bit funny random with specials that you can deactivate, as you can break you out of combos and throws. With weapons pre-placed on arena.  Nothing deep or balanced, a mere bonus mode.\n\nOverall, yep, one of the best beat-em-ups ever. Because people say so.\nAnd I don't know about you, but I respect the kind of developers who can make a completely addictive game without any \u201cgrind for more grind\u201d, ten thousand unlockables, leveling and other things to keep people in the game. Just a game that is proud to be just a game, ending when it should, making you want to play it again another day. Trying it for 5 minutes and ending up finishing it with sweaty hands and on the last life. Respect!"}]}
