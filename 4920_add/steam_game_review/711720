Both dimensions have seperate layouts, You have to switch multiple times in between levels in order to continue.\n\nAlthough I love games with  Steam Achievements or Trading Cards, This one has none, However due to the nature of this game being entertaining yet difficult at the same time, I'm going to recommend it!\n\nNice little indie game. :)!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWyZRHIgBRw", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506999367, "timestamp_created": 1506999367, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "steamid": "76561198003384433", "num_reviews": 14, "num_games_owned": 1013, "last_played": 1506997208, "playtime_forever": 12}, "votes_up": 5, "voted_up": true}], "success": 1}
