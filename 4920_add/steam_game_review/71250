In 2003 the game was re-released for the Nintendo Gamecube under the title \"Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut\" that improved the graphics and added some new features. This version came out in 2010, part of the Sega Dreamcast collection on steam and consoles. \n\nIn Sonic Adventure, you have six characters (plus a final story) each with a unique style of play. \n\n[b]Sonic[/b]: Fast pased 3D Platfroming gameplay, the main attraction of the game. Sonic has the most stages and most of them are fun to play (Speed Highway, Emerald Coast to name a few). \n\n[b]Tails[/b]: In the Tails stages you race Sonic or Eggman to the end of the stage, its pretty simple, and its pretty fun. \n\n[b]Knuckles[/b]: The game kind of goes downhill from here, but its not quite there yet... Knuckles has treasure hunting stages where you find three peices of the Master Emerald, I can see why someone may not enjoy this in a Sonic game but these stages aren't that bad in my opinion. Once you figure out the locations the peices can spawn its fun seeing how quickly you can finish the stage. \n\n[b]Amy[/b]: Amy has slow 3D platfroming stages. These aren't fun at all. A robot named \"Zero\" chases Amy through her stages and you have to work at avoiding and stunning it to progress. I thought these stages where quite annoying because that dang robot. On a good note, Amy only has three stages in her story, and getting through her doesn't take long at all. \n\n[b]Big[/b]: Oh dear, Big the Cat is kind of famous for his stages in Sonic Adventure... They are the most out of place. Big has fishing stages, the main objective is to fish for his friend \"Froggy\". If you enjoy games like Sega Bass Fishing (Also part of the Dreamcast Collection) you may like Big's gameplay. I personally don't hate it, even though I agree it doesn't fit well in a sonic game.\n\n[b]E-102[/b]: Eggman Ex-Machina ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). E-102 has shooting stages, the objective is to save your friends after you betray eggman. I love E-102's gameplay, its just really entertaining shooting up as much as you can. \n\n\n\nThe story is really simple. Eggman wants to distory Station Square, you gotta stop him. What more could you need in a Sonic game.\n\n\nOne of the best parts of this title is the \"Chao Garden\", where you get to raise little pets called \"Chao\". Playing with these adorable little creatures becomes quite addicting and give the game some replay value as you gain items to level up your Chao in the action stages. \n\nLike most Sonic games, Adventure has a nice soundtrack, and you can access every track in the game through the sound test mode. \n\nThe game really hasn't aged well from 1999-2003, so its not exactly eye candy. The biggest issue arguably  is the pi*s poor camera, it will likely be the main cause of death in this game.\n\nIn the end, the game plays alright(when the camera doesn't scew you over)  and for the first 3D sonic game it was a pretty dang good first try. \n\nI recommend it."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505992001, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428688", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35102015", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019317826", "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1505360015, "num_games_owned": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 229}, "timestamp_updated": 1505992001, "received_for_free": false, "review": "speed"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505427290, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505730", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "34958812", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198316469101", "num_reviews": 42, "last_played": 1506961796, "num_games_owned": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 148, "playtime_forever": 310}, "timestamp_updated": 1505427302, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\"CLEANSE YOURSELF.\"\n\"No.\"\n\n...\n\n[b] [i] UUUUUUUUHHHHHHHH SSSSSSHHHHHHHIIIIIITTTTT [/i] [/b]\n\nRock, yeah~!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505964238, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35096528", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198184391379", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1498721353, "num_games_owned": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1393}, "timestamp_updated": 1505964238, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm not a really good reviewer at all so I'll keep it short and say that despite the games's hilariously numerous shortcomings, I find the gameplay really fun and this game will always have a special place in my heart.

For one, playing through the game is actually quite a blast, blowing through stages at top speeds with Sonic and Tails and blowing everything to smithereens with Gamma...then everything goes downhill. I had the displeasure of completing this game to 100% completion, and let me tell you, the Big the Cat sections and Chao Garden were a nightmare, and the mission mode was just a chore (with the exclusion of the infamous Mission 53, which is the only thing that kept me from my 100% run back in 2007). I absolutely hated most of what this game threw at me, but, once again, this game has it's moments. The soundtrack is awesome, the levels are memorable (with the exception of Lost World, which is just bad), and the Chao Garden, although very boring at first, becomes addictive later on. Glad they improved that in the sequel, which I can say just as many bad things about. I recommend this title only for those who into the main Sonic games that weren't super gimicky but not barebones.
