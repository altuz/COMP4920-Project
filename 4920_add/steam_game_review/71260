It makes it nearly impossible to get the kind of responsiveness I was used to with a controller and frequent tapping is all but impossible.  Honestly, I had to abandon my replay due to the fact that the keyboad presses can't keep up with the demanded rythem needed to pass the levels.  Very frustrating.\n\nIf you don't have a controller ready to play this, there isn't a point."}]}
