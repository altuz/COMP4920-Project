( even if it is just color differences )\n\n\nBugs\n1)During a defend your base mission, a enemy spawned but was off screen, i could hear the bullets hit, but it would die. maybe make the spawn die if they are off screen too long?\n2)Could place barb wire slightly in the floor of the 2nd story ( was green) but took money away and didnt spawn the barb wire.\n\n\nThats all I have for now, great game, would love to see what a little polish will do for gameplay.

Chose your items carefully as they make or break a mission. This game has significate replay value as it lets you go back through missions you have completed.
