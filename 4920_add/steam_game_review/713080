'Run blindly through forest looking for random object' game. Does advertise walking for hours, didn't expect it's because there are [b]zero[/b] checkpoints. Which might not be so bad if not for the invisible enemies and sound fx made in a toilet bowl. No real story to keep me interested. Basic quest-line that is unvoiced and directs to objectives. Couldn't find car key when standing on top of the dot so I decided to kill myself and call it a night. Might be worthwhile for achievement hunters, anyone else I'd recommend a pass. Cheers.\nhttps://youtu.be/1A5IfhNIue4", "votes_down": 1, "language": "english", "comment_count": "1", "votes_funny": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506793897, "timestamp_created": 1506793672, "written_during_early_access": false, "author": {"playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "steamid": "76561197985036092", "num_reviews": 262, "num_games_owned": 10176, "last_played": 1506788127, "playtime_forever": 25}, "votes_up": 26, "voted_up": false}], "success": 1}
