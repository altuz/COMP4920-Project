Sonic Generations is the culmination of decades of sonic games as you traverse through 2d and 3d versions is levels. Platforming, collecting secret coins and getting high ranks is highly enjoyable. Even the levels from the terrible Sonic games are great. A prime example of what SEGA should have been doing with Sonic for a while now. Now if only they were able to stay consistent from game to game.  \n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506472934, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35232832", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318334073", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1506900474, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 192, "playtime_forever": 192}, "timestamp_updated": 1506472934, "received_for_free": false, "review": "T O A D  M O D: yeah this game is pretty freaking amazing. high action, high adrenaline, and toad memes.

So why the dislike? The god awful controls. This game basically requires you to have a controler. If you just have a keyboard, like everyone who's complained about the controls, you'll have an awful challenge. For now, I'll be refunding the game until/if I get a controler. Besides that, which is a really big fault on this port, the game is good. If you have a controler, you'll love this game. If you only have a keyboard, good luck."}]}
