If you're into platform oldschool type of game as Super Mario bros, Yoshi's Island, you will love this game !\nThe rendered 2D World is absolutely beautiful.\nA lot of vibrant colours, whimsical looking enemies.\nA very cartoon like visual that's fun and eye pleasing.\nThe animations do not feel completely fluid, however, that does not mean it detracts from the rest of the visuals.\nVery fun game! It's not easy as I thought :)\nAdventures of Heroes offers a great platforming experience for any fan of the genre. It harkens back to the day of old school platforming where mechanics were solid and tight.\nIt doesn't try to be more than that, but I don't believe the developers are trying to be different.\nAdventures of Heroes offers a refined platforming experience many of us grew up with.\nI can't help but recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of platformers.\nSure this game may not be for everyone and thats fair enough. So no matter what, it is still a very good game.\nA cute fun bright little platformer.
