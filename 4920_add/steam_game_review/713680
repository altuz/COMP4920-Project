I've played for less than 10 minutes with the intent to play this game casually. But so far, I didn't get very far, maybe like 500m before I kept stumbling on same obstacle and then have to start from the beggining again. I feel like there is a lack of variety in graphics or eye candy in order for the replay to be enjoyable for the amount of times I died. Although mildly distracted while I was playing I will endeavour to try it out again later with the intent of a more skilled attempt.\n\nGame play tip: The cane can sit over the ground spikes but they must be all the way down before you walk again.\n\nOther feedback is that the game dumps you with an insane amount of achieves at the beggining which seemed annoyingly stupid.Imo.\n\nI randomly stumbled on this game through my queue & I purchased it because it was on discount for less than a $1. I think it is OK for the price I paid and more or less what I expected. Game play is as in the trailer."}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1}}
