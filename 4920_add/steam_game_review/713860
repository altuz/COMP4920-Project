Got much more then expected. Wonderful indie game that touches base on sensitive subjects. Exactly what the medium should be used for. Could remove all the sex talk and still have something quite deep and meaningful. Not for everyone but if you're an open minded sort and willing to try something different, well worth checking out for the price. Mixes Poetry, Picasso like art and a Pink Floyd esque soundtrack, mesmerizing stuff.
