Not really and here's why.\n\nThe original Swarmriders was an absolute blast. High octane action gunning down a swarm while riding in a super fast motorcycle (and also the start point of the titular Blade Saint). But this version improves on the original immensely. As well as the core gameplay of gunning down the huge swarm, there's also the introduction of the Manastrike and the Melter/Shield powerups from the later UBERMOSH games.\n\nThe music is just as intense as the action and it really gets the heart racing.\n\nIf I did have any complaints then it would be that there is some occasional slowdown when there's a lot going on at once but that doesn't detract from the fun at all.\n\nAll in all, very fun and highly recommended. (Though if you're not sure, try the original Swarmriders first. It's free to play.)"}, {"voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498991", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506114557, "recommendationid": "35137727", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_reviews": 2, "steamid": "76561197996793233", "num_games_owned": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1506809465, "playtime_forever": 79}, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506114557, "review": "Can't recommend now, wait for a price increase."}, {"voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493632", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 11, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1505897070, "recommendationid": "35080111", "language": "english", "votes_up": 5, "author": {"num_reviews": 70, "steamid": "76561198055814197", "num_games_owned": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505897388, "playtime_forever": 68}, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1505897070, "review": "Getting better (and I say that assuming that another of these games will be released, considering who the dev is) and probably the most entertaining game of all the Ubermosh saga, but it's TOO RNG-spread reliant.
