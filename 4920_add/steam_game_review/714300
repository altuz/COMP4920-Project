Though, execution details is very clean but somewhat sloppy, and gameplay time might be limited (not sure yet how many cases are there). More puzzle than strategy,  You investigate crimes by asking witnesses and following suspects, then you press them to confess,  all in stylish noir visual from public domain photos. \n\nThe sloppy execution is in how there are limited action you can do (though the gameplay is more about picking what action you do since you have very limited time), the limited user interface/options (though actual UI is simple,  clean,  and easy to use) , and how there might be limited gameplay, since the cases aren't randomized, and once you know solution of a case there's no point of replaying it. I don't know how many cases are there yet though.\n\nSummary! Great idea! Worth it for the low price."}, {"voted_up": false, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500146", "comment_count": "4", "votes_funny": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507136325, "recommendationid": "35476103", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198048729831", "num_games_owned": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 206, "last_played": 1507135820, "playtime_forever": 206}, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507136325, "review": "State 04/10/2017\n\nGame is ok. \n\nWasn't sure to recommend this or not, but for now, unless some stuff gets improved, I can not recommend it.\n\n\nThings that need to get improved / fixed:\n\nOption to put the game to windowed and not forced windowed-fullscreen at a fixed resolution.\nOption to lower the Volume.\nMaybe an option to change the resolution?\nOption to go back to the menu from the game. For now, you can only quit the game by dropping a case / winning it, then saving and quitting the game. Alt+F4 doesn't work. You need to quit the game to change something in the settings, if you are in the game already.\nThe case around Nick Holden has a ridiculous win-condition. It doesn't make sense at all!\nGame can give you a case you are forced to drop, in a situation where your chief does not allow you to drop one more.\nAt least 2 cases rely solely on using the special witnesses, without hinting at them. If you lost access to them already, you are screwed.\n\n\nWhile these problems can be quite annoying, the game is still good and for the small price tag it has, you can give it a shot. When those problems get fixed, it surely is a good game for the 2-5 hours long story"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2}}
