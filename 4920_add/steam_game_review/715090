Thanks to this simplicity, it is a great starting point for those who are new to these kind of games.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nRescue Team 4 is a start of a new era, a soft reboot to the series. This becomes rather apparent once we realise that it does not continue the story of RT3\u2026 or gets any kind of story, to be exact. We only have 63 stages of pure time management gameplay, with the usual core mechanics: gather resources so our rescue workers can save some people and animals by clearing obstacles and rebuilding production structures.\n\nSince this game sets a new starting point, it focuses on (re)introducing the players to the Rescue Team series, while never even trying to leave the comfortably mediocre territory.  Some stages can have a tight time limit (assuming you play timed mode), but generally, the level design is rather basic in terms of layout and goals. The internal achievement system can ask for some interesting secondary goals, but that is about it.\nThis mediocrity can be both a setback and a great selling point though: veteran players will find only a mild challenge in RT4, but it should suit any newcomer to the series or the time management genre in general."}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1}}
