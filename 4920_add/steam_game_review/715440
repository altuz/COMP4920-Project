The story ended sooner than I expected or would have liked (3 hours if you're quick), but there is definitely room for multiple playthroughs, and from looking at the screenshots I missed quite a few scenes.\n\nThe game mechanics are very Choice of Games. If you're familiar with the format you should know what to expect. The stat-system can be a little erratic and annoying at times, especially once the stat-checks start kicking in towards the end, and the story seems to be somewhat hamstrung by the Choice of Games format. Regardless, I really enjoyed this one and look forward to doing another playthrough.\n\nUnfortunately, though, you cannot conquer the world in this one, but you can get a nice statue"}, {"voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505807", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1506919161, "recommendationid": "35404936", "language": "english", "votes_up": 3, "author": {"num_reviews": 24, "steamid": "76561198089031078", "num_games_owned": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 653, "last_played": 1507007655, "playtime_forever": 653}, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1506919161, "review": "I enjoyed this game far more than I expected.
