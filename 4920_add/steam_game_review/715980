Definetely would be better is you could use a controller istead of keyboard. The most annoying thing is that you can't change the keys to WASD and you have to use arrow keys which I haven't used in years. Levels are really pretty and you have to come up with a strategy to beat each one of them. It can get a little complicated to pass but it's due to ridiculous controls, not because the game is unbearable hard."}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1}}
