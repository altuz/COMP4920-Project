I bought it for my classroom and it will serve the purpose of giving the kids the experience of seeing a [near] life-size dinosaur skeleton in a 3D environment. \n\nMy only gripes are clipping and hands. You can teleport yourself in the actual bones which breaks the immersion a lot. Also, your hands are represented by Vive controllers. It'd be nice to have these replaced with hand models.\n\nAgain, for $AU1.99, this is very good. If you're looking for a simple experience where you can see a number of dinosaur skeletons, this is a good purchase."}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 0, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "No user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 0}}
