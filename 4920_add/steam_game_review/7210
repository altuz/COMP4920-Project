A little clunky but fine.\n\nPuzzles:\nHit and miss. You start the game in a hospital room with a girl, but no real direction. From my persepctive I just wanted to leave the room or take her out, instead I had to work out that what the game wanted was a contrived solution to a problem that may or may not exist and would only work in very specific circumstances. Don't get me wrong I love point and click adventures and they have contrived answers, but they tend to layout the problem first. While I continued with the hope that this would change, it did not. There are some good ones and there is potential there but its just not great.\n\nSo why the negative?\nThe main character is instantly dislikeable and not intentionally. The script could have done with some editting and you spend a large amount of time in prolonged, boring and tedious cutscenes.\n\nWhy I might continue....\nOk with all this said there are two solid reasons why I might continue this game. They are \"Yesterday\" and \"The Next BIG Thing\". Both excellent solid games, with fun puzzles, intriguing stories, interesting characters. I mentioned potential earlier and these games show that Pendulo allowed that potential to come to fruition. I kind of want to continue this game as I know that the studio is capable of a lot more and there are more games in this series which could potentially pick up. \n\nOverall:\nUnless you have the same attitude like me, avoid this game. Buy Yesterday, The Next Big Thing, Gemini Rue and Shardlight if you are looking for fun Point and Click Adventure games.\n\n"}]}
