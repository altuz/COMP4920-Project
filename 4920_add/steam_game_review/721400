The only reason I didn't play longer was because I was starting to get drenched in sweat.  That's not good when you have an HMD on.  There's a couple other \"runner\" VR games out there, but this is the best one that I have played.  I had a lot of fun and I got a good workout.  \n\nKeep in mind, you will have to jog in place, jump, strafe left and right (or at least lean left or right), and throw items at targets.  Your job is to run as far as possible while collecting as many coins as possible.  There will be some guys behind you ready to tackle you if you slack off (however, any decent running and they will be nowhere close to you).  You will have to avoid obstacles such as cars passing by on the road, or stationary cars, or cops.  You will be jumping hurdles every now and again.  Fail any of this and you die (which might be a relief if you're getting tired).\n\nYou do have a helmet on by default, but you can turn it off.  You can also disable music, but I wasn't annoyed by it.  I just wish I could listen to my own music and I hope the dev puts this into the game in the near future.  There's also a leaderboard for bragging rights.  The graphics are more than okay for this type of game (in fact, it's the best graphics in all the runners I have played).  Just don't expect realistic looking places, cars, or people (more on the cartoonish side).  The game ran well without any problems ... unlike me.  I couldn't find a way to cheat the game (moving your arms alone is not enough to get you moving and moving your head isn't either, I actually had to jog in place to get moving).\n\nSo do I recommend this game?  You bet.  Just make sure you're up for a real workout.  And that you have your HMD on tight and motion controllers safely secured in your hands.\n\nRating 8/10.  Best app in its class yet, but not for everyone .. think of this game as more of a way to increase fun in your cardio workout than an actual game \n\n"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "review_score_desc": "1 user reviews", "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 1}}
