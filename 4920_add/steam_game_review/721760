With a stat for sanity that sounded like fun ! Beeing a criminal is supposed to make me a better fighter and better at intimidating than the others . Still intimidation basically always fails if the option doesn't say that you draw a gun on someone and that's just stupid . Anyone can intimidate people like THAT ! If you try intimidating people any other way it just ends the conversation . So playing as a bad guy is really boring and gets you nowhere .\n-stats .Don't exist so you have no idea what you're good at or how good since the archetype discription doesn't seem to have any meaning during the game .\n-fighting .As i said you have no stats so you can't see how tough you are . Again as an experienced criminal armed with a gun and knife i thought i could fight a guy with beer bottle . Nope ,died . I even got a trophy for figuring out he's in the next room ,drew my gun BEFORE entering and STILL he \"surprise\"-attacked and disarmed me when i entered ! Tried to fight using my hidden knife then and got killed with the bottle...yeah great...good thing i chose the charackter with the best fighting skills...\n-cases .Lots of effort put into them but if you actually read everything and investigate it's barely possible to come to a wrong conclusion . Much too easy .\n-safe games . There are none so if you rely on your charackter beeing able to fight anyone you have to start ALL OVER again wich is extremely boring in a game where you already know the solutions to all cases from your last playthrough so there's nothing to do differently except for not trying to threaten people . \n-gets less and less interesting .\n\nIn conclusion : Good idea ,one cool twist early but extremely disappointing all the rest of the way ."}, {"voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 0, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507130588, "recommendationid": "35473914", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_reviews": 51, "steamid": "76561198057258664", "num_games_owned": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 191, "last_played": 1507130444, "playtime_forever": 191}, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507130588, "review": "I've played many games like this but wow, this was deep and really impressive, have really enjoyed playing it and will restart again to see where else this great story can lead me, would recommend Highlands, Deep Water for anyone thati s a fan of these type of games as it is definately one of the best I've played."}, {"voted_up": true, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "votes_down": 1, "received_for_free": false, "timestamp_created": 1507083936, "recommendationid": "35461026", "language": "english", "votes_up": 1, "author": {"num_reviews": 4, "steamid": "76561198010735093", "num_games_owned": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1163, "last_played": 1507175719, "playtime_forever": 1163}, "steam_purchase": true, "timestamp_updated": 1507083936, "review": "I keep dying all the time.\n10/10"}], "success": 1, "query_summary": {"total_positive": 1, "review_score": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "review_score_desc": "2 user reviews", "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 2}}
