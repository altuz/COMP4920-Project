Not a huge one, more like a big meh feeling. I think the only upsides were the new environments/backgrounds and that they finally cured the game of pixel hunting-itis. The items you can interact with and pick up were a lot more visible and obvious now. \n\nBut then, everything else seemed to have rolled downhill from there. I brushed it off initially from the first game since I was convinced it was a one time thing, but sadly, they kept the glaringly racist caricature of a character (Joshua) and made him part of this game's main story. And the main plot itself was just so disappointing in comparison to the first. Joshua's mission from the first game should have been kept as just a silly joke to help Brian with his main goal, how did it escalate to become the second game's plot? Just...no. I thought it could be as fun of a mystery as the Broken Sword series, but it just got too ridiculous as soon as chapter 3 to 4 rolled in.\n\nAnd ultimately, I feel like taking back what I said in the previous game's review about Brian. In the first game, he was sweet, nerdy and polite but here he had finally transformed into the generic douchey protag I said I was glad I didn't experience. Such a travesty, I really liked Brian in the first game. I'm so sad with what he's devolved into. I think other reviewers expressed it better about his poor character development. Why??? What were the writers thinking???\n\nI also have gripes about how in Chapter 2, you had to loop the conversation with Flowerpot (and the guard) to get to Kordsmeier over and over again. I don't want to have to deal with that more than once. And Sushi's VA sounded really robotic and slowly that it was pretty aggravating."}]}
