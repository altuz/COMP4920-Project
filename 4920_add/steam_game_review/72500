I was not able to get a working controls either by keyboard or mouse or my gamepad. There is no help menu or even a key binding screen I can tell what keys I need to press. If you want to rebind the gamepad keys you need to edit the configuration file manually. If you want to rebind the keybaord keys then you may be out of luck as I saw no configuration file for the keyboard.\n\nGameplay wise, this game really wants to be Geometry Wars. It's to the point where it follows Geometry Wars home and Geometry wars should consider getting a restraining order. If this game was commercially successful the developers of Geometry Wars should consider legal action. You might think I'm exaggerating, but I played them side-by-side and the difference is uncanny. The only difference is that Geometry Wars actually works and is a lot more polished.\n\nAcardia mimics Geometry Wars in the following ways; grid background, distortion effects, weapons and weapon progression, controls (best I can tell anyway, seeing as they didn't really work for me). Even much of the enemy AI is a mirror of Geometry Wars. It's even to the point where the same AI had the same rough shape and color as it's counterpart in Geometry Wars.\n\nJust buy Geometry Wars if you don't already own it.

The dev of this game put together an awesome soundtrack for this game, which ends up making it extremely relaxing and enjoyable to play.
