You receive one (or for some characters two) quest and just run through areas killing hordes of monster with mostly either modified basic attack or a simple spam spell. The whole story is told by one main quest at the start - the local God from the mythology you picked gone mad and you have to find out why. You dont have to be a Sherlock to understand that the game's name is the evil behind it all. Having tried all the mythologies I can easily tell - its the same for all characters.\n\n[b] Combat & Challenge : 3/10 [/b]\nThe combat in Loki is absolutely dull - If you play a melee character you simply spam potions to stay in the fight (they have a really small cooldown) while as a ranged you can just skill full damage and one-shot most of the enemies in the game even before they reach you. There have been no challenges at all in the the time I played it before I got bored besides some bugs like getting permanently stunned, or not being able to attack due to a stun bug (you can still move, but do no actions until you quit and re-enter the game). The skill trees are really boring aswell, you basically pick your main spell and stick to it the whole game or until you get an upgraded version of the same spell. Playing a ranged character it was absolutely easy to kite since enemies base movespeed is slower. Overall absolutely boring combat for an action RPG.\n\n[b] Graphic & Interface : 2/10 [/b]\nThe graphic is a shame for 2007 release and feels more like Diablo time, so 1996. The effects are cheap, areas have no detail at all (egyptians run around in the desert that is simply a huge yellow square), towns look like they were last minute implementation. The interface is not fitting the game at all, since you have tons of slots for skills but you will mostly use 1-2. The bag window is a mess, the skill trees are not structure at it took me a while to figure out how to change skill tree focus, it overall does not feel polished at all.\n\n[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 3/10 [/b]\nThere is no progress in this game besides running through the area killing everything and reaching the next area. Since there are no mini-games or anything else to do in this game besides smashing your mouse for hours, not a high rating to give here.\n\n[b] Audio & Immersion : 3/10 [/b]\nThe only immersion I had was on the main screen where you have to select your mythology / character. It was underline with fitting music while you decide if you want to be an Aztec Shaman, Norse Warrior, Greek Fighter or Egyptian Mage. Sadly, after picking the hero you wont feel much immersion anymore and since there is nothing noticable about the music or the sounds, it gets a terrible rating aswell.\n\n[b] Side-Notes [/b]\n[list]\n[*]This game is single player only.\n[*]This game contains no achievements, neither in steam nor ingame.\n[*]This game has no steam cards to collect.\n[*]This game offers medium replayability since you can try out different characters to have a big different skill set-up, but since the combat feels the same it most likely wont last long anyway.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\nLoki feels unpolished and sometimes even broken, looks old, sounds bad and does not have any feature to make you stick with the game. It is one of the very few games that I have not finished (if you read my reviews, I finish 99% of my games) simply because it felt like wasting my time. Killing hordes of monster in Loki is simply boring and unrewarding, there is neither challenge nor a story to back up your progress. Since there are tons of action RPGs that do quite everything much better, I would suggest you dont waste your time or money on Loki.\n\n\nI hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game.
