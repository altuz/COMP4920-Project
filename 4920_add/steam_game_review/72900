The narration is also a plus point for me, very poetic although its very much upto taste. However it is a shame there is no sound, I think some sound design could have gone a long way.\n\nThe game had real technical issues when it first came out but as far as I can tell they have been resolved. The combat system is interesting and thoughtful, with alot of variation for different tactics and approaches to character builds.\n\nThe story is unique and interesting in gaming and is worth the effort in my opinion, I had to endure a lot technically when I originally played it but it was worth it because the story was well done and presented with a unique pace and arc for the character.\n\nThe game and the developers sadly seemed to have had a hard time over this game, getting it out, but I hope one day they get to complete thier story and give the game a full conclusion that it deserves."}]}
