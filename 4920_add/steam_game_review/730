But really hard to master\n-Valve Anti Cheat is well...not really working. It can happen from time to time that you get some hackers in Matches.\n-Smurfs/DeRanker and Griefer will destroy the experience often\n-Updates that debalance the game \n-Valve is jut intereseted in selling skins and Cases\n\n\nAs a conclusion if you are a hardcore competitive gamer who doesnt fear a steep learning curve or toxic teammates,and you can ignore the hacker/smurfer/griefer every second game.
