No no, you get to control a KINGDOM! Lead your kingdom and your heroes to take back your land!\n\nPROS\n\n~Its an enjoyable mix-up, where you arent the \"hero\" but the mayor\n\n~Lots of classes that branches out to advanced classes\n\n~the bigger your town gets, the more enemies that attack, which is a neat feature\n\n~Its very comical, from names to descriptions\n\n~There are some logical feuds with heroes, like dwarves and elves, and palidans and necromancers\n\n~The longer you let a monster building stay, the more advanced it gets, which is a neat feature\n\nCONS\n\n~Its obviously dated, with older graphics and AI\n\n~Sometimes, the heroes are EXTREMELY greedy, to the point of which you'll ask 500 to search a spot a few feet away from an already discovered spot\n\n~Rogues are quite useless, they die often, and dont do much other than steal a few gold coins from enemy graves and poison things.\n\n~The final boss is SUPER BS! If you dont do everything PERFECT, you'll end up being destroyed and have to restart, Ive done about 20 retries with the final boss, with each being about 30 minutes to an hour, until out of sheer luck, he glitched out\n\n~The content is broken, since the company that made this game, GameSpy, went out of business, and cannot access online.\n\nOVERALL\n\n7.5/10\n\nIta dated, but its fun. I wouldnt get the collection since the DLC is, well, unavailable unless you do some wacky hard thing that dosent garuntee that it will work, but if you want the game thats less money, go here\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/25980/Majesty_2/\n\notherwise, if you wanna try your luck and coding skills, buy this game and attempt. If you fail but like the game, you can always refund it and buy the original Majesty 2"}]}
