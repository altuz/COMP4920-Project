Some arrogant noble causes trouble by sending militia to attack you, so you slash back by building towers to defend your castle and sending various troops to counter-attack. Campaign takes you through Ardania to find the culprit of the attacks on your cities. Sounds cool enough, but unfortunately, you probably shouldn't get too excited.\n\nDefenders of Ardania is a mix between Tower Defense (TD) and Reverse TD. You can protect yourself by building towers, but ultimately, you win by destroying the enemy castle(s) by sending out troops. Troops are quite strong: a single tower can hardly destroy a wave of enemies, so you either need to build more towers in clever spots or, which is usually easier against AI, destroy the enemy castle quickly.\n\nThere are about 5 different types of units and towers, none too different from other games of the genre. Some units can attack other units (rather weakly) and others can attack enemy towers. There's some strategy involved in placing the towers, as you are limited in the number of towers depending on the level. You may also direct your troops using a waypoint (yep, a single one) or place bounties (akin to Majesty but costs nothing) to focus fire on certain enemy. What is interesting is that your troops gain experience: using certain type of troops makes them stronger.\n\nLater on, this feels indifferent though: it was always easiest just to either (following is a couple of killer strategies for campaign) [spoiler]zerg-rush the enemy with cheap or fast troops or use a reverse scorched earth tactic building a couple of waves of turret-destroying magicians followed by bomb carts that insta-kill castles.[/spoiler] This worked in almost every map: While AI can build towers to counter your troops, it's not up to these kinds of attacks.\n\nAlso, while there are three races, you can only play humans in the campaign, the rest restricted for AI and multiplayer (which I've yet to try: servers are empty though). Every race has its own towers, troops and spells, which is cool, but with mere single campaign, the game feels unfinished: there really should be a campaign for each race.\n\nStory is quirky and and full of nerdy jokes, puns and references, so at least it does not take itself too seriously. You do have to endure some quite bad voice acting along the way (I'm looking at you, Kilia the Elf!). Playing it through lasts about 5-10 hours, probably less if you can come up with winning strategies faster. I guess it might be worth it for the amusing ending. :P \n\nWhile not entirely bad, there are many better TDs out there: this one fails to fill its niche in the reverse TD. So if you just kind of like TD genre, stay away. If TD is your hot chocolate, by all means do get this one but do yourself a favour and do so when it's on sale or bundled."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1392650870, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559806", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "9155665", "votes_up": 50, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197994855588", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1392644202, "num_games_owned": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 948}, "timestamp_updated": 1392650870, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Poor AI; no solo play except for campaign; campaign levels have locked towers, units, upgrades and spells; campaign is fairly short and only one of the 3 races, so no chance to get aquainted with either of the others races before playing multiplayer; poor interface; poor response to input; poor unit pathing updates; maps are limited to the campaign maps."}, {"votes_down": 6, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1407214111, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527084", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "11556583", "votes_up": 24, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198000983922", "num_reviews": 19, "last_played": 1407214363, "num_games_owned": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 19}, "timestamp_updated": 1407214300, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I should have read other reviews before purchasing.\n\nLimited resolution settings.

Much more accurate than \"yes/no\".\n\nOk, I see a lot of bad reviews about the game and wanted to clarify some things some people have said, as well as provide my own views.  This review may contain spoilers, so don't hover over spoiler areas if you don't want the game to be spoiled.  I hope the devs are reading this, because this game could be great if they'd just make a few changes.\n\nFirst thing I want to say, some people claim that there is [i]terrible voice acting[/i].  I hear nothing wrong with the voices you twit!  Stop coming up with things to whine about.\n\nAs for someone saying [i]\"The game runs like shit\"[/i]?  Maybe you should check your machine specs because it runs 60FPS or better at 1080p on my machine, no issues whatsoever, everything's smooth and fast.  The controls are a little odd though but it doesn't \"run like shit\".\n\nI think the game has too few levels in it to be worth $10.  Maybe if multiplayer and skirmish had some different maps, but this game does not.  It limits you on the amount of towers you are allowed to place even so it isn't worth replaying the same old maps over and over again.  The best you can do is place 20 towers, and that's in the final mission.  [spoiler]Also in the final mission, tower placement seems to be bugged because I can't place them in some places if it might block where the enemy castle MIGHT appear even if I've blocked his ability to go to those places.  What the game SHOULD do in this case, is have the enemy walk through the tower with the shortest path to your base, until you unblock the path, if his castle should teleport to one of those places that you already towered up.[/spoiler]\n\nIf the game devs had released some DLC with new maps, that might have been nice.  But this doesn't appear to be happening, and the DLC is too costly to be worth it for what they give you. $3 for a new tower, spell, and unit for each race? Really?  Come on.  We don't even play as any other race because replaying the game sucks and as far as I saw, I couldn't even change my race.  $2 for 1 new spell for all races, and 1 new spell for each race?  That's just plain greedy.  From what I read, the spells aren't even that great.\n\nReally though, it's a tower defense game.  It can't be that hard making a new map every once in a while for it.  Hell, to make the game really worth it, you could release a map editor/creator, and add workshop support, and let players add their own maps in.  This would be well worth the time then because I'd be playing this game all the time with custom maps and the such like that.  Right now, Defense Grid is so much more better because of the large large volume of maps you get.\n\nSpoiler related to two missions:\n[spoiler]In the last two missions, you find out that you need to use an exploit of removing a tower and placing one to change the entire wave path forcing the end game bosses to go back and forth infinitely just so you have time to kill them.\n\nIn the last mission, you can't even kill him with spells.  He has 1000 HP according to the info.  I hit him with lightning 8 times, and he didn't die, and I lost to the onslaught of enemies.  So the third time I played, I rushed him, placed towers at the entrance once I stopped the castle from moving, high level mirror towers (not their name but it's how they work, just can't quite recall the name off the top of my head :P), then hit him with lightning and kept placing new mirror towers all around him trying to change up the path as much as I could to keep the enemies and him at bay.  It eventually successfully worked, even though he destroys all towers in one hit, or two hits and your repair can't stop him so repairing a tower he hit is useless because he'll attack it again very soon.[/spoiler]\n\nThe game lacks a pause feature from what I am seeing.  Sure, you can hit the escape button, but it isn't an in game pause, so that you can look at the map, and find a suitible pathing setup for your towers and plan ahead.  It would also be nice to be able to build towers while the starting game talking is being done, maybe even with gold income disabled during that time just so you can have the towers built and ready, not that it is that big of a deal though.\n\nEnemy AI needs to be able to destroy their own towers in order to rebuild or move them.  I've noticed that the only way an enemy can build new towers is if you lightning them.  And this is an advantage because I noticed he had no anti-air in one level so I sent nothing but air units because he couldn't rebuild towers.  The enemy also isn't very good at planning ahead.  If you start sending lots of air units, he still only keeps one air tower, nor does he do much upgrading.  he's more focused on sending units.  There should be a harder AI here that is better at predicting your attacks and able to hit you harder.  The last two maps, weren't even as difficult as some of the others.  The only thing difficult about them was their nearly invulnerable bosses.  Otherwise, they'd have been easy.\n\nI like the Majesty lore, I played Majesty Gold way back when it first came out even and still have the disk and the HD version on steam.  They did well enough on the lore of this game to make it worth it, it would be nice if they would add more maps.  That's really the only thing I can see right now making it worth the $10 it is currently costing.  I think it's current worth would be more closer to $7.50, and the DLC would be $0.10 per added spell, $0.15 per added unit, $0.20 per added tower.  Global spells count as one spell.  This is just my opinion.  If they were to make DLC to add new maps, I think it would be grand, much more worth it and a map editor?  Hell yea that'd be way more worth it.  Especially with workshop integration for ease of DLing and sharing maps.\n\nNew game modes could be fun too but alas, I'm not sure this game will change.  [b]If you see it on 50% sale, or better, then you might like it.[/b]  It is beatable without cheating, I consider it an exploit to [spoiler]delete a tower and place one elsewhere to change the path[/spoiler] but it is kind of part of the tower defense genre in some games so I guess it isn't that bad using this method if you want.  :P  It just doesn't offer you anything other than campaign maps.  Skirmish re-uses these maps, and so does multiplayer. \n\nShould you get this game full price? [b]No[/b].\nWill I re-review if anything changes, or the game is updated, or such? [b]Yes[/b]."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485920912, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499392", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 5, "recommendationid": "29619988", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198005357293", "num_reviews": 32, "last_played": 1429137178, "num_games_owned": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 399}, "timestamp_updated": 1485920912, "received_for_free": false, "review": "So if you were a DEV and you decided to just mess around making a TD game on your lunch break while talking on the phone to your Girlfriend or boyfriend. you would end up with this.\n\nSpinning a nickel on your desk trying to get it to stand on its own. is better time spent.
