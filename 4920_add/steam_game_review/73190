This game used to be completely unplayable (a few years back), with turns lasting up to 10 minutes. Fortunately, the devs have fixed this entirely and the game runs really smooth, much better than many of the old AGEOD games do. Turns don't last more than 30-40 seconds for me which is very good, considering how many nations there are in the Grand Campagin.\n\n\n[b]Features[/b]\nI haven't played this for quite a while, despite purchasing it a few years back, and I'm astonished. Overall, just now it feels even better than Victoria II, for several reasons:\n1. The military matters are done in a much better way. There are a lot of different kinds of units, historical commanders, detailed system of simulating the outcome based on a good and tested engine, which includes a lot of different factors that affect the result. \n2. The colonization system is superb. There are a lot of possibilities including the different kinds of expeditions - anthropological, geographical, natural society, military expeditions etc. Even things such as gunboat diplomacy and naval demonstrations of force are included which is amazing. You can even bribe the local chieftains or force them to cede their territories. Apart from that you can also send your merchants, missionaries, establish trading posts, build road/telegraph networks, and in the end send immigrants and build a proper colony there. Something like this has never been done that well in a video game and I simply love it. \n3. Economy is done quite well, with a lot of different structures for you to build. Sure, I would prefer it if the civilians were building them themselves according to the supply/demand but it's good enough. \n4. There are a lot of decrees that help you influence your nation, as well as a lot of different national factors that add flavor to the states - some are more developed than others, some offer more libery to their citizens, there are on different stages of development etc. It really varies them a lot. \n5. You can play with your friends easily due to the turn system which I honestly prefer to the real-time one. \n6. There are quite a lot of countries to choose from - virtually all the main world powers. I would certainly prefer to be able to play as any country in the world as in Victoria 2 where I really enjoyed my Dutch and Swedish gameplays, but it's good enough. \n7. Countries that are multi-national such as Austria-Hungary have different national forces which is fun and historically accurate. \n8. Diplomacy is done really well, with options such as a State Visit to boost relations in addition to more typical ones. It's done pretty well. There is a very realistic threat system where your military buildup will make other nations threatened and respond to it. It also raises the general tension and can potentially lead to war. \n9. There are a lot of technologies to research and the whole research system is done quite well. \n10. Music is really great and certainly fits the time period. \n\n[b]The Setting[/b]\nI really love the nineteenth century setting of the game. It allows for much more than simple military rivalry between the nations - you can compete for prestige, colonies, wealth, choose your allies and cooperate with them, and exploit third-world nations. \n\nThe are some mistakes, such as Bonaparte as the President of France in 1880, but overall I really love that there are real monarchs/presidents and prime ministers. \n\n[b]The Verdict[/b]\nI played quite a few long campaigns in Victoria and Victoria 2 and I must say that this game is a superior one. The military system and the colonizations are not even close while economy-wise they're pretty similar. Give it a try, since it's pretty stable now, and I think you'll like it.'\n\nOverall, the setting is amazing. You can do much more than just fight with other countries - you can engage in an arms race, compete for prestige, wealth, colonies, or cooperate peacefully to benefit both your nation and your allies. Nineteenth century is possibly one of the best settings to allow for such a myriad of activities."}]}
