It is instead a very simple model of Japanese feudalism whose focus is placed on fast-paced military expansion, with the end-goal of conquering 50% of Japan and becoming its Shogun.\n\nSadly, continued development of this game was abandoned in favor of the far more robust Crusader Kings 2. Modders have long since cloned Sengoku within that game, making this one redundant at this point. That being said, if you really find that your money is burning a hole in your pocket, Sengoku is NOT a bad game and can be a good time-waster. Just be prepared to deal with its flaws."}]}
