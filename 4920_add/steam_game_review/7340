It should give you about 6-10 hours of enjoyment. \n\nThe game is split into 10 different chapters where you have a certain amout of time to solve 8 puzzles. There is generally more than enough time to complete these without too much of a worry but some leave you floundering around in the dark. If you fail to complete all 8, the chapter restarts again. As you go along you get a token that will give you the option to bypass any puzzle that you have a problem with. I think there are 5 in total. They help if there is a puzzle you don't enjoy.\n\nThere are quite a few different puzzles that test your memory, observation and logic. Some are excellent and a few are poor but generally this is worth what you'll pay for it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1455431076, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500461", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "21198683", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198084223806", "num_reviews": 46, "last_played": 1455389926, "num_games_owned": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 317}, "timestamp_updated": 1455431076, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A great game for puzzle lovers and casual players alike.

Might be good for Kids.\n\nNo problems with bugs or anything like that. \n\nCons:\n\nThe puzzels seemed to get boring after awhile.  The aged paper/colors seemed to half put me to sleep sometimes. Not the relaxing pleasent feeling I was expecting. \n\nThe Hidden Object Puzzles just didn't work for me.  And I play a LOT of Hidden Object Games - and still a lot of times it was difficult to figure out what they wanted without (and sometimes with)  the Hint button. An example is in one place you need to \"spell\"  out one long word.   The only thing is that the clues for the word are letters on 4 different peices of paper. ummm.  Also the \"story\" really isn't interesting so working out the final solution was also sort of meh.  \n\nI don't see any replay value - although some people seem to. \n\nFor $10, I feel the game is  too pricy. On sale not so bad. Still I do feel frustrated."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500346805, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33621216", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198237618894", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1499817876, "num_games_owned": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 333}, "timestamp_updated": 1500346805, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nice game, I used to play it when I was a kid and I used to love the puzzles. It has always been very easy though, wish it was a bit more challenging and there were achievements. Finished the game very quickly. The story itself is a bit weird but the goal of the puzzles is very interesting, although I think it is a little bit pricy considering it is a very old game and absolutely nothing changed on the graphs, story, puzzles difficulty and so on. To children I think it is a great way of teaching how to use logic to solve problems - although some solutions sometimes seem to not make sense at all, but it also teaches to work with the unexpected and open your mind to different possibilities, considering all ideas even if it seems stupid at first. In general I like it, but if you are thinking on buying it I would recommend waiting for a Steam sale or something like that."}]}
