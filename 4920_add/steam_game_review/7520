Figured the first time it was a fluke.\n\nSince the game is unstable, I suggest no one buy it no matter how much I like it- just get it on console since your hardware won't be destroyed from that version.\n\nMonsters: Dinosaurs, demihumans, brigands, giant insects, and really crazy monsters that look like they could be the answer of 'what would happen if a zerg strain or dungeons and dragons mimic was infested by an xenomorph'. I'll admit it's rather jarring to go from one to the other in the same game, but since it's so different from every other game, I like it."}]}
