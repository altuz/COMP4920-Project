Now it is part of the Two Worlds 2 Complete bundle (also sold separetely too, of course). I like tower defense games, played my share of them on Steam and in free flash games. Because of this I can say that this tower defense is truly terrible. Why? Well, it looks terrible, sounds are bad and the level design is poor. The only nice thing about it is that it sort of shows a short prequel story to the Two Worlds II game. It consists of 5 levels and an arena. Here is what it is about -[spoiler]1st lvl: defend the castle from orcs, 2nd lvl: defeat orcs in their camp, 3rd lvl: fight desert guardians, 4th lvl: fight more desert guardians and find first throne, 5th lvl: fight undead and find the second throne ... the two thrones are used for the energy transfer and this is where Two Worlds II starts[/spoiler]. Gameplay is standard but there are difficulty spikes, for example when you you destroy EVERYTHING with fire mages and then in the last wave the boss comes in and wrecks you. If you got it already then try it, if you want to, but there is no real reason to buy this in the bundle or separately. There are better (FREE!) flash tower defense games out there...\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]"}]}
