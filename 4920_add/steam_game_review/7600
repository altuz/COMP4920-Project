Don't interpret that as \"SMR has no good features\", though. It's still a good Railroad Tycoon game; just a little simplified for user-friendliness.\n\nAlso, [b]don't let the constant crashing deter you[/b].\nThere's a fix out there (and now it's right here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/7600/discussions/0/35221584409498211/ ) and it's relatively easy to do. Just follow OP's instructions and you'll play for hours without any issues."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506413668, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35217779", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198017703439", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506848437, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1060, "playtime_forever": 1087}, "timestamp_updated": 1506570905, "received_for_free": false, "review": "After Following some tips from the guides on here and disregarding any sense of realism, I have to say there is enjoyment to be had in this game. However, end game is still a mess.  And everything put below I still feel is valid.  7 Hours more since the original review.\n\nMy Recommendations have NO bearing on the crashing issue most people are talking about. RRT3 and RRT2 also have issues with newer windows, there are fixes for all 3 games so they have no bearing on this review.  \n\nTL: DR if the size of this post scares you.\nDon't worry I get it, I just like to be complete.\nThe order is simple, RRT3>RRT2>SMR! \nNo Idea where Mashinky Is going to Fall, but from what I've seen, I can tell you its better than this. Mashinky, RRT2/3, Transport Fever all Have better control and are far simpler one you start making large systems.\n\nI'm off to Look at the Free alternative OpenTTD.\n\nAfter 10 Hours. I have learned a few things but First the Pros,\n\n-Not Overly bad for micromanagement.\n-Looks Fantastic even with its age!\n-Supply and Demand are EASY TO READ!!!!\n-Clicking on the town will tell you where it gets its \"Main\" demand (whatever they process) Food, Pass, Commodities are up to you. Clicking a Supplier will show you who wants those supplies. \n-Decent Number of Steam Trains. \n\nMeh.\n- Simplistic Controls, you could actually get a mmo mouse, and never have to touch your keyboard. \n- Train models, seriously, if you want anything for a modern Diesel, you have ONE choice, Newer Electric. Hope you like the TGV Because that's it. (Even by 2006 standards its barren)\n\n\nCons\n1.) Crash fix Patch, go get it. Seriously, All of the problems stem from when this game came out, games would only take 2GB of Ram, because 32bit Windows was standard, (4gb max) so they limited the game so it can't crash the system. Go get the patch, it will make the game use 4Gb. Much More stable. If you don't do this this game can be crashed out by simply having trains get stuck. GET IT. \n\n2.)Clipping, bridges have NO regard for what they do, they will build supports in the middle of existing track, clip with each other when splitting off or running a double track. \n\n3.)Tunnels are hard as Hell to make unless you want to dive straight down. (mountains are \"okay\")\n\n4.) Dense Stock maps, Hard to get everything in, either you end up with bridges everywhere, trains waiting (sidings are almost impossible to do as cities are literally, a 8 car consist away from each other. \n\nEverything from here has to do with Realism, or actually controlling your trains. If this doesn't concern you then skip to the Finale.\n\n5.) Realistic Routes are not a thing in this game. Trains take the shortest available route, Period. Including Running backwards on a track, so it will drive head onto another train because shortest route.  (Signaling issue). This is a hard mode problem FYI, If you don't mind magic 8 car consists just suddenly facing the other direction, or trains passing on a single line track (oncoming and overtake) \n\n6.) Signaling\n- There is no dedicated way to place a signal. Best way is to make a dead end 'Y' and delete the dead end, which leaves the signals behind.\n- There are no settings for signal at all. All signals are Two way. Period\n- The only way to get rid of a signal is to delete the track on one side of the signal, so every failed \"Y\" you have to delete the MAIN LINE to get rid of the signal. \n-Even waypoints would be better if signaling is as useless as it is in this game. \n\n8.) Starting a standalone circuit is not possible (properly) You can always make a track to where you want to start, make your starting piece, then delete the link. And without proper signalling, you're gonna want that. \n\n9.) There is no way to make a dual crossover, L track to R track  and R track to L Track. If you want this you will have to do TWO single crossovers, and this does work, However with the dense map seldom have room in a main line to allow access from both sides.\n\nFinale\n\nAll In all. The end of game just ends up as a mess of point to point rails, or Train's constantly waiting on one another. Hard routing is not very good as you have no control, And the AI can mess up the simplest of Systems.\n This game is a LOT more just hop in and play than Railroad Tycoon.  If you came from Titles like Transport Fever, Stay with Transport Fever,  I don't even own that game, I watched ten minutes of a stream and made a list of around 20 things that are doable in that that I could not do in this.\n\nIf you're looking for bargain Railroad builders, and aren't naive enough to sacrifice gameplay for graphics. Pick up a Copy of Railroad Tycoon 2 (RRT2) . That game does EVERYTHING this game does, and lots more. LOTS more.  (I recommend 2 over three, Three's UI is Massive, and takes up literally half the screen.) That game Currently is half the price of this game. \n\nRailroad Tycoon 2 is more complicated than this, but the track building is way more controllable, Train AI is WAY Smarter, You can set up a realistic train route by simply adding service stations,(which the train needs anyways) Way more Train Options,  even some original ones from the dev. Way more commodities and resources, a terrain editor. RRT3 has better Train management, better commodities management, distance actually might mean something, or not depends on the flow of product on the map. Automatic train loads means you don't have to constantly manage the loads of every train. Etc.  UI is Just OBTRUSIVE with newer Resolution Monitors. \n\nAnother Game to be looking at is Mashinky,  I watched a Stream of it the other day. It WILL BLOW SMR! OUT of the water. Early Access Launches on steam here in a week or so. You should look up a stream of it before buying any of these."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505303959, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505122", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34918106", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019876067", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1505306357, "num_games_owned": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 204}, "timestamp_updated": 1505303959, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game crashes like crazy.
