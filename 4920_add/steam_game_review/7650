Steam says I have not even played a single hour due to the fact that I bought the game and instantly grabbed OpenXCOM (A program which helps fix various old bugs, and breathes some much needed QoL into the series. Like mods.) and started playing that. Now, because I'm a god damn idiot, I started on Superhuman Ironman mode. DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY OR ANUS!!! Because you will be fucked... and they will use drills to help \"lube\" you up for the mind controlling fuckers. But anyways, I have now finished TFTD, with (a general guess since OpenXCOM doesn't have a time played stat.) about 80 hours+ in the game, and 13 failed save files. (UPDATE: I am required to play 5 minutes of TFTD to write a review, so I left it open for 5 minutes. Also, I am no longer just recommending OpenXCOM. YOU REQUIRE IT. Just trust me.)\n\n[h1]What you NEED to know in order to win: [/h1]\n\n-Life is not sacred or valuable in the beginning or even at the end. Always send out your cannon fodder first. You are allowed to get attached to various soldiers AFTER M.C. training, not before, because they will die, and it will be because of bullshit. Even then, be prepared to lose your best because of bullshit.\n-[b]BE A LITTLE BITCH![/b] You have a door on your craft, do not leave the craft until you feel safe enough (IE there are enough corpses outside the door to make a wall.) to leave and hunt down that last bastard.\n-As an attachment to the prior knowledge, do not even move on turn 1. Before you open to door, make sure you have maximum coverage of the outside area to see things. Then open the door. If you see things, just hit end turn, unless you're certain you can kill it. Which, knowing TFTD, means you will miss, and lose half your squad if you THINK you can hit.\n-Armor is a lie. While it is not as much of a lie as in the original UFO defense, it is still a pretty big lie, and there are aliens which will one shot you in the end game, even if you're wearing the best you can.\n-This is the most important thing you need to know. If you forget all else, REMEMBER THIS: The trick to winning the cruise ship terror missions is very easy, and most people don't think about it. For this mission alone, there is an auto-win button in the bottom right corner of your actions panel. It says \"ABORT\", but trust me, it's just incorrectly labelled.\n\nAnd as a final statement, if you finish this game, I'd recommend replaying it with some of the advanced options enabled, playing the original ufo defense if you haven't already, or look into the modding community for UFO Defense, because they are fantastic. On the same note, there is a fork of OpenXCOM called OXCE+, which I'd highly recommend, because it brings even more QoL to this already amazing franchise, and is compatible with most mods. One of the mods I'd highly recommend is a mod called X-Piratez, which, WARNING: Does contain some mild nudity, which can be disabled in the options menu. While some of what I said remains true for X-Piratez, there is one key difference. LIFE IS SACRED. Even your enemies, try to stun everything you can.\n\nAND FINALLY, the rating. I'd give this game a FUCK TENTICULATS /10 (A 13/10 for those unfamiliar with TFTD, since they make quite a bit of this game's enemies look like child's play.)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503058900, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34327424", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198058183789", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1505504467, "num_games_owned": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1095}, "timestamp_updated": 1503058900, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you're going to get this game. I suggest you download OpenXcom, as it improves graphics and adds more stuff into the game. Don't expect this game to be easy, just don't. I got my base raided in the first 20 mins of playing this game, it's a pain in the **** if you're a beginner to these type of games. Worth the money, if you're up for the challenge."}]}
