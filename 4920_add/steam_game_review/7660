Even when you\nlose funding you can still play and even make money.\n\nThe combat is best played in real time as the turn based was not particularily well developed.\nThe enemies \"rubberband\" in difficulty which is possibly good.\n\nA big appeal of this game is that it inadvertently forces you to make decisions on whether to do one\nthing or another with certain trade offs, \"Should I stick with orginisation A or B?\", \"My men are beaten to a bloody pulp, but they're already on bad terms with us. Should I help them?\"\n\nThe worst thing in the world is the feeling of being fired (nevermind the aliens destroying humanity part).\n\n\nTips for if (when) you buy the game:\n*Buy hoverbikes, they're small targets, cheap and near impossible to hit\n*Look up the advantages of certain orgs. and raid the rest (stun raid everyone if you're a dirty filthy beautiful \"cheater\").\n*Don't blow any buildings up. You'll have to pay for it, literally.\n*OpenApoc seems promising, go check it out :^)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501354581, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503513", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33887548", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198050537907", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1439224340, "num_games_owned": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7673}, "timestamp_updated": 1501354581, "received_for_free": false, "review": "love this game will recomend it to my friends and fellow gamers"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502460344, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501450", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34169216", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065374797", "num_reviews": 8, "last_played": 1502517951, "num_games_owned": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2030}, "timestamp_updated": 1502460344, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I bought this game because I enjoyed it when I was younger.
