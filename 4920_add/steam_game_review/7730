The strategy layer and base management are definitely the best parts and the most familiar to the X-COM roots, but the combat felt a little lacking. Most of the time the game played itself, ending interceptions after only destroying one or two UFOs because the rest of the squadron already took out the rest. Since they're mostly autonomous aside from a few vague orders you can give them, they usually do most of the work without any input. However the environment was rather immersive and despite the shortcomings in combat I still enjoyed it. Also the story is nice, does a decent job of establishing a bridge between the plots of the first two games and that of X-COM: Apocalypse. \n\nAlas, it's old, so it crashes constantly and requires extreme vigilance in saving whenever you do anything. I don't know if there is an ironman option but I wouldn't highly advise against using it if there is. I'm giving this a Recommended rating, but I honestly wouldn't recommend to anyone other than fans of the original who would like a little more plot and lore and don't mind the lacking gameplay. It doesn't have anything to do with Julian Gollop though so those die-hard fans would be probably be disappointed by that."}]}
