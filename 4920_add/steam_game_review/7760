The gameplay is genius - all the steps you take are essential for your next step's success. When the game first came out I played it non-stop, writing down notes about my soldiers achievements and heroic actions on a piece of paper, giving them my imaginary medals and being emotionally crushed when they die in combat. I'd never forget the name of my soldier, who was the sole survivor during a base defense mission! He was the last man standing yet managed to kill a dozens of aliens and by the end almost died yet came out victorious. I had to name a medal after him.
