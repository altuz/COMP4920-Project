Someone in your way? You've got two forward-directed weapons to take care of that. Sprinkle a few mines or spikes behind you to keep others from overtaking you.\n\nThere are a few weapons systems to choose from, and each can have three upgrades. Not quite what the original had, but good enough.\nSeveral cars can be bought - if you win often enough.\n\nTo get more cash blow up stuff - the track is littered with explosives, strategically deposited for maximum carnage. Doing so will also grant you boons - invulnerability, speed boost, etc...\nThe same boons can also be picked up as power-up during the race itself. They'll not wait for you, though - the move about, left to right or up and maybe down.\n\nAll in all its a fun game. Fast racing, lots of explosions, good music. A feature that I personally like very much is the announcer, who comments your driving, for example when you take first position with the rest in hot pursuit, he may comment with an enthusiastic \"You're leading the pack!\"."}]}
