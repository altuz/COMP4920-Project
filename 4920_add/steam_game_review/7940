A lot of people would say there are a lot of mods but there are quite a few servers that are just normal vanilla servers and the mods are enhancing mods for the gameplay rather than weapons and what you can use. Im finding it very difficult to get used to a keyboard way of playing after playing various Cod Series on console but i've really enjoyed playing CoD4 again and would recommend it if you dont want to pay more for the remastered edition.

Same here, except the Singleplayer is pretty decent. If youre buying it for the Campaign, then go ahead, do you. \n\nIf youre buying this game for the Multiplayer, buy Battlefield 4. People say the Multiplayer is amazing, \"Oh, best COD, best COD game, Multiplayer is still amazing\" Thats horseshit. This game is fucking broken, and im just saying, people say, \"NO HACKERS WHATSOEVER!!!\" Guess what, All the servers have Extra XP, literally one kill, and level 25. It spoils the fun for me, which was going around and shooting people, THE ONLY POINT IN GETTING A COD GAME! TBH, get Battlefield 4, or something else on steam. There are several Multiplayer games here on Steam. As much as i dislike playing it, CS:GO is so much better compared to this garbage. And, if you really want to play this game, Just Get the most Recent COD, its practically the same. Fuck this game."}]}
