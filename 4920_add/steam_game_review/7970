Every 4 maps you pop back to the menu screen, to admire your stats and items I guess.\n\nIt's sort of a crummy mix of arcade shooting and actual hunting. For some reason, you can get bonus powerups, such as x-ray vision and bullet time, as well as a free skill that basically highlights anything shootable in the area.\n\nYou CAN move around but you move so slow and the maps are so small that there's not really much point. Which probably explains why you can't rebind your controls.\n\nStrangely enough, and this was never explained ANYWHERE, you can pull up the unlocks menu, and equip any items in the game at a moments notice, from scents to weapon sights to pistols to shotguns.\n\nThe game is around 8 hours or less, but I usually got bored and walked away to do something else and just forgot to come back.\n\nIf you want a quick arcadey shooting game to waste time on, then have fun with this.
