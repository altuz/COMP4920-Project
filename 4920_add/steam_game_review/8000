Also the hidden collectibles were fun to hunt for.\n\nHowever, this game has some flaws with camera control and a few parkour bugs, which almost made me give up on this game in some occasions, like the grand pyramid or Obelisk Khamoon. In this place there's a leap that was unable for me to complete, as Lara kept into the wall and falling down. If this happens to you, just go to settings before launching the game at activate V-sync, it worked for me after. Also some controls like the ones to perform the adrenaline dodge are hard to figure out, but once you do, the game becomes easier.\n\nNonetheless, I really liked the game, and I don't regret the time and money I spent on it (bought on steam sales)."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505958326, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504605", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35095376", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198309492267", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1479265666, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2055}, "timestamp_updated": 1505958326, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great to revisit this classic, still holds up in terms of gameplay with mesmerising music intersesting puzzles and still to this day great verticality\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506247508, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489254", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35176437", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057221241", "num_reviews": 280, "last_played": 1506245611, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1506247508, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nice game"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506455305, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496517", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35229017", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198052941330", "num_reviews": 79, "last_played": 1506455042, "num_games_owned": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 651, "playtime_forever": 762}, "timestamp_updated": 1506455305, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I used to really like Tomb Raider: Anniversary as a kid, but it really hasn't aged well. The story is dull, combat is a joke, which consists mostly of just shooting animals, the climbing is terrible, as Lara will very often miss ledges, or the game won't be clear about where you should jump. The game is also very inconsistent when it comes to checkpoints. Sometimes, it will give you way too many, while other times, it'll give you way too few. It can be very annoying. Graphics still look pretty good, but that's about the only positive I can think of. Puzzles feel pretty copy/paste after a while, too.\n\nIt might be interesting to go back and see where Tomb Raider started (this is a remake of the original), but other than that, I think you should stay away from this one.

In essence, I love games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted.\n\nBut I do not love, or even like, Tomb Raider: Anniversary.\n\nWhile it has the modern sensibilities that Uncharted introduced, but comes nowhere close to that quality.  The reason comes down to the simple fact that Anniversary epitomizes jank.  The way the camera moves will make you nauesous, and the many times that Lara will jump the wrong way or simply not grab on to something, plummeting to her death, will drive you insane.  In one instance in the game, there is long segment of finding cogs to make platforms move, so you can reach higher places.  To get to one of these, you grab on to a swinging pole, then jump to another, and then to a ladder that is fairly long, but when I leapt for it, even though Lara's jump reached the apex of the ladder, she somehow managed to forget to grab on and plummeted to her death.  And this was with Manual Grab off.  Putting it on just makes the game more frustrating.\n\nThe combat is always hit or miss, depending on if the enemies stupid that round or not, running into invisible walls and not knowing of the concept of turning around, even though their eyes are on you while you strafe around them or flank them, unloading bullets into them.  During these encounters I was reminded of one time I wet to my local zoo, where I watched puffins in a glass cage, and one of them continually swam and swam...straight into the wall.  It didn't turn and swim in any other direction, and I watched it do this for about five minutes, totally transfixed at how stupid it was.  The enemeis in this game can constantly be just as dumb, if not more so.  Other times, if they are acting smart, other janky issues can pop up where you shouldn't get hurt or killed, but you just do.\n\nDeath should always be the fault of the player.  A game should never feel like a death or game over is the games fault.  But the vast majority of the times your death will unmistakenly be the game's fault.  One of the major sins of this game is that the ORIGINAL plays better, even after all these years and with new modern sensibilites in this game.  While the old games may have had the tanky controls of old, the kind that are awful to play with now, if you go back and get used the original's controls and movements, death becomes the player's fault, and that says a lot, regarding this game.\n\nAs for the graphics it's nice to see Lara and the environments get the full remake treatment from the original.  It's just not worth the expense of the inferior gameplay, however.  Especially when there are many times when animations can be downright horrible at times, or the many other issues that were more apparent years ago, but all over the place in this game.  One time, I kept running around in circles, moving the camera along with it, simlpy because of an hilarious glitch, where Lara's braid would get caught on either the camera or some other unseen force, and her hair would stretch to where you had moved to, to impossible lengths.  Other times the graphics can effect gameplay, where you might be hanging on a ledge that goes around the corner to the otherside, but when you move around, for a brief second Lara is holding onto nothing, hanging in the air, because of horrible animations.  I'm fairly certain a lot of these animation issues, and clipping issues, are the cause of so many platforming deaths.\n\nThen their is the story, which hasn't gotten any better with age.  Which simply means it's that much worse now.  I won't say any more on the story, because it's completely forgettable and not the reason you'll be playing this game in the first place.\n\nThe one thing the game has going for it is the developers have added things to unlock, for if you do enjoy the game it might give you more incentive to play the game again.  But that depends on the very rare chance that you like the game enough to want to.  There is also the ability to explore Croft Manor, but that and the other features don't improve the broken issues, so they probably won't make the game any more enjoyable.\n\nIn the end, the developers first attempt into the modern era was a complete failure.  Fortunately, however, the next two games, Legend and Underworld, though still quite janky at times, lost much of those issues, and became fun to play, even having a much more compelling story.  It's just too bad they had to learn how to make those games by making a game that falls short in every way possible.\n\nStory: 3/10\nGameplay: 2/10\nGraphics: 3/10\nOptions: 5/10\n\nOverall: 3.25\n\n(In my rating scale 5 is average.  Every subsequent number is a noticeable change in a quality, meaning if you see anything above an 8, there is a great game there, and anything below a 4 is just bad.  It's not to sound harsh, but because I believe all games need to be analyzed from a critical perspect, comparing them to the standard of the games form when they were released.  It is why this game has done so poorly in the numbers.  If you want the unabashed, brutal truth, read my reviews, which I will be posting more and more of now.  Please don't hate.  I'm more intrusted in constructive criticism on the writing angle itself.)\n\nAlso, for anyone who doesn't find the review helpful, feel free to comment on why.  That way I can  hopefully become better at making my reviews more helpful.  I'm always looking to improve my writing."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504805959, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490401", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34799035", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197976406065", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504805923, "num_games_owned": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 104}, "timestamp_updated": 1504805959, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Completely bugged. don't buy"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506110988, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486807", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35136566", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198344246966", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506110506, "num_games_owned": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "playtime_forever": 1487}, "timestamp_updated": 1506110988, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Very tedious levels, glitchy graphics...
