It still is?  Well then Fate of the World should still be relevant! \n\nUnfortunately it's still relevantly bad.   What was an interesting concept, comes out as a rather weak and mediocre card game if you can even call it that.    In fact it shouldn't be called a card game, but I'll get that to that in the moment. \n\nThe entire game revolves around \"The world is going to shit\" for various reasons in each of the scenarios.   You have to control the world and make it better, and fix it with your... evil omniscience?  Ok you're SUPPOSED to be the good guys, but you have WAY too much visibility into the world, you can just \"Buy\" agents in different areas and have them enact policies... yeah a little twist and you're the villain trying to take over the world. \n\nBut you're supposed to be GEO (a global enviromental organization ).  The Good guys who are going to protect the planet through... a card game system.  Uh oh, the planet is doomed. \n\nSo the \"card game\" is really policies that your agents are implementing.   Agents can use one card every 5 years and some of them are on going.  The thing is this isn't a \"Card game\" this is a policy and politics game, but if you call it that no one would play.  This isn't like any card game I've played and the fact is, it's not a good change.  If it was just policies and instead of agents you could have \"employees\" or \"government workers\" we'd have a different story.   Instead there's a push for \"card games\" and so we call it and play it like that.  It's not and that's the first problem. \n\nThe other problem is the \"cards\" are both not random and not that interesting.  You can use a card to build a technology office and then \"research biotech\".  That's sexy... too bad the explanation of what it does doesn't really leave any further insight.   In fact much of what you do in this game is the exact definition of government policies.  Poorly defined far reaching but hard to understand exactly what you did.  That's the government for you. \n\nAnd the thing is, often you have very abstract goals.  Raise HDI to .7 by yeah 2045.  If you fell asleep while reading that line, then you're probably normal.  The game uses these types of terms everywhere adding to the nebulousness.  There's wars and actions going on all over the game, and the fact is the player probably should care about this but none of it is that interesting and the player only has limited control or understanding of the effect of policies or why they aren't working. \n\nThere ARE reasons but the fact is the user has to do so much digging understanding and learning and the game makes it so hard that to be honest, most players are probably better off going and playing almost any other game.  Even games like Diplomacy that I'm not a huge fan of do far better to explain their policies and subsystems, that it's a far better game. \n\nThat's the real problem with this game, at the end of the day, the gameplay is abstract, the cards are uninteresting and while global warming/climate change/what ever we want to call it IS an issue, Fate of the World does the worst job trying to make it fun, interesting, or even worth the time to look into it.   This isn't even a game I'd say \"has a great idea\".  It's a game that probably sounded like it could be controversial or interesting at the time, but probably needed an entirely different design or team to deliver on it. \n\nBut for what it is, I'd recommend pretty much no one to go play this.  Other games I've talked about there being a specific core group that should play it, but for this one, even the environmentally minded gamer is going to want something different than what this game promises.   If you do want governmental simulation, check out diplomacy.  But skip this."}]}
