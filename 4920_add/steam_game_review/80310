The serious noir dialogue and themes focused around identity, a common sci-fi trope. My only concern was the super-low resolution pixel aesthetic would take some time to adjust to, but I quickly found the design of interactive objects to be executed well with only a couple exceptions. I felt like a real sci-fi gumshoe as I queried databases with keywords etc. that I found while reading journal entries and the sort. The puzzles were not challenging, but they were rewarding all the same.\n\nOverall, a great experience and it comes highly recommended!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502653872, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500835", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34221382", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198076084516", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1502653582, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 452}, "timestamp_updated": 1502653872, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Pretty good"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501007171, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499450", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33792038", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198372926237", "num_reviews": 24, "last_played": 1499966618, "num_games_owned": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 537}, "timestamp_updated": 1504189963, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a pretty good point and click adventure with really good pixel art, the few space landscapes it provides being the pinacle of that - including one that seems a mild 2001 refrence, one among plenty of other references, like Cowboy Bebop (which I really didn't expect at all here).\n\nIt has decent enough voice acting, but you can turn it off, if for some reason it bothers you, or if you're really retro..\n\nThe gameplay is quite something. Unlike a lot of other recent point and clicks where you mostly handle an inventory with combine features, and just click on an object to interact with it (whatever it is: looking, touch, take, etc), this game has a few extra options like: look, touch/take, walk.\n\nUnfortunately this isn't to the game's advantage, if I can understand making look and interact different behaviours, I can't quite get the point of having anything more than that. Particularly in Gemini Rue a lot of the actions are just plain awkward to do with so many controls, and a mere interact would just make everything simpler, for instance: There's a point where you have to climb to a ladder, but you must first get on top of a box to reach it - how do you do this apparently simple action? Well, first you must \"touch\" the box, move it (A or D) then press W to go on top of it, and then press touch on the ladder. So now you're on top of a balcony, but wait - how do you come down? Well in that case you have to \"walk\" into the ladder, you can't \"touch\" it you have to \"walk\", and then S once on top of the box. Fairly non-sensical if you ask me. Even with these awkward moments because they're somewhat occasional they're not much of an hassle.\n\nBut then there's gunplay, yes, you read that, gun play in a retro p&c adventure. How does it work? Well, if you built a time maching and got a gun, whent back in time, and pointed said gun at the head of the developers of-- I don't know-- Beneath a Steel Sky-- and forced them to have gunplay in their game, I'm pretty sure they'd come up with something very similar to this. To answer the question: you use WASD + ctrl + R (+ whatever) to do things like: take cover, aim through the left, aim through the right, turn on a little bar that if you skillshot it right your character hits an headshot, change target, reload. Let's just say I appreciate the attempt, but it doesn't work all that well, better yet, it \"works\", and I'll leave it at that.\n\nMost of this game's puzzles are fairly intuitive and I did most of this game by myself, but it couldn't be a p&c without a couple of off the wall puzzles. The first one comes up when delta-6 has to take a gun away from the testing room, I'd have never, ever in a million years figured it out. I'm not saying it doesn't make sense, it does, but it takes something like 20 steps, including taking an unsuspicous prop (that's not even clear that you can even take it) from an apparently unrelated room to solve it. Fortunately most of the game isn't like this.\n\nFinally the story. It's decent, memorable even, or at least has memorable moments, and even interesting themes and undertones. Yet the twist is forseeable from 20 miles away, and isn't that worth it, I'll argue a better story could have come out of not having it at all. And the climax is nicely built up, but loses itself. And the final remark said by one particular characters doesn't help either. But considering what you usually get off of these games, this one is worth some praise."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501171082, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497122", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33835681", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198068362169", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1481847064, "num_games_owned": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 595}, "timestamp_updated": 1501171082, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Are you here for the meds?"}]}
