Voice-acting is done pretty well but could have been a bit better perhaps. Graphics were pretty good for the time but I love this era of games! Its a fairly short game but challenging enough to keep your interest throughout the adventure. It does have some re-play ability which makes it a bit more challenging. Overall I think its a pretty sweet game at an affordable price( I did get it on discount..he-he). I will definitely check out more of the series and suggest you try this one out."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501273804, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500648", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33864844", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198020771419", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1501273690, "num_games_owned": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 350}, "timestamp_updated": 1501273804, "received_for_free": false, "review": "well for a sale it's alright.
