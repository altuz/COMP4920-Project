Then you'll like this one. The real question is: who is TOMO? \n\nThe mechanics from Unbound ar brought back and not only are they improved but they are also much more useful this time around, especially with Joey. You're now playing as Rosa again; dead set on finding the link between several ghost who appear to have been murdered!. If you've played unbound then you can gues who. What I enjoy the most is not only the relation unbound but the progression of Rosa and Joey as characters. You get to see them interact more, but more importantly you see how this line of work affects Rosa. The puzzles are toned down a bit in difficulty compared to unbound but still fun to do."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499031372, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497112", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33154385", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198036124555", "num_reviews": 384, "last_played": 1499031316, "num_games_owned": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 144}, "timestamp_updated": 1499031372, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1] 7.5/10 TJBs [/h1]"}]}
