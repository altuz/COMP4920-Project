It is not too complex like the newer manager games are.\n\nJust pick a team, select tactics, buy players and build your team. There is a lot more to it then that but what im trying to say is this game is just so simple to pick up and play which makes it so much more enjoyable.\n\nSo much fun building a dream team with players gone by like lampard, gerrard, pirlo and free kick master Juninho\n\n8/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1494632872, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 9, "recommendationid": "31712374", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197995643957", "num_reviews": 38, "last_played": 1373803607, "num_games_owned": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 52}, "timestamp_updated": 1494632872, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I decided to holiday and leave this game running by itself to see how realistic the results would be. \n\nIt's 2020 and Liverpool still haven't won the league. \n\nFull marks, 10/10."}]}
