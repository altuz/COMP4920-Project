An enjoyable shooter.\nThe pc port is awful, it runs like crap on modern hardwares (if it runs at all) and still using GFWL. You are lucky if you can make this game run without stutters and other performance problems.\nI do not recommend this pc version, get it on a console instead if you own one. All that years passed and the fucking GFWL still present - I would call it an \"abandonware\", because it doesn't seem like anyone cares about this game anymore to remove this abomination disguised as \"drm\" or fix the performance  problems.\nBottom line:\nA good game plagued with technical problems and ancient drm."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506247058, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35176272", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198057221241", "num_reviews": 280, "last_played": 1506189252, "num_games_owned": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_forever": 11}, "timestamp_updated": 1506247058, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Nice game"}]}
