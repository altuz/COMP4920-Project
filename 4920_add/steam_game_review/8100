L4D/Vermintide co-op first person game against guerilla fighters. Corridor-like linearity. Teammate system is clunky as now you cannot do everything yourself and have to order the AI around. Default keybinds are a little bit bloated because of radioing the AI, having to manage the aim reticle with zooms and crouch and prone. I find this game did not have the casual awesome action feel that other games of this genre have because of its reliance on precision aiming to proceed smoothly through the game. As such it was more tense and less fun. All you really do is mow down guys and plant C4's among concrete hallways."}]}
