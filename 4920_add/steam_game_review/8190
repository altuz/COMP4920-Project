I'm going to cover some of the specifics in this review.\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nFor a game that came out in 2010, JC2 looks amazing. No matter how low you turn the settings, it really looks gorgeous. The sky stretches on for seemingly forever, and the render distance in this game is truly incredible. On \"Low\" I'm still able to see the entire map from the top of the tallest mountain in Panau. Not to mention the foliage. Trees are everywhere (except for where they aren't) and the amount of grass doesn't seem to change based on the graphics settings. The water looks great too, though the rain doesn't feel as volumetric as one would think. 9/10\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nJC2 is probably one of the most fun to play games ever made. The grappling hook is an awesome addition, and using it together with the parachute enables you to traverse the map quickly and easily. Gunplay, while entertaining for a while, gets repetitive and becomes just another feature.\nThe physics in JC2 are hilariously...werid? and that's not a bad thing. In multiplayer, grappling two cars / planes / boats together and driving them in the opposite direction produces some interesting results. Driving cars isn't anything special, but be warned about the motorcycles; it might just be me but I've experienced a small delay when turning, and while that doesn't sound bad it can quickly ruin your day.\n[b]Campaign[/b]\nThe campaign isn't anything memorable. It provides a bit of background for Rico and the storyline, but that's about it. I didn't enjoy it that much or spend much time in it at all, because I was too busy blowing things up in freeroam.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nThis is a must-have for your Steam library. It's incredibly fun, and great value for the price.\n[b]9/10[/b]"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506870370,

with,and so on.\nGraphic quality is more or less alright\nGrapling hook- A device in this game which makes the game unique and lot more fun,there are so many possibilities for this
