They put their focus on another comic property that this time they made more than two games out of it. And that comic property is the crime fighting anthropomorphic rabbit and dog, Sam & Max themselves! This duo made their first debut in an underground comic series dating back to 1987, but it wouldn't be until the release of the widely acclaimed LucasArts computer game \"Sam & Max: Hit the Road\" was when the characters started to become recognize to a wider audience. Then came an animated tv series that ran for one season on the defunct Fox Kids soon followed. After the show ended it run, there was plans for there to be a sequal to the \"Hit the Road\" titled \"Sam & Max: Plunge Through Space\". The game was intended to be an XBox exclusive title that revolves on Sam & Max retrieving the stolen Statue of Liberty by traveling through space. The development team consisted of former employees from LucasArts and Steve Purcell the creator of Sam & Max would of pitched the story. The project fell threw when the development company Infinite Machine went bankrupt a year after production began and the sequal was abandoned. After the cancelation, LucasArts annouced that they themselves will develop a new sequel to the game titled \"Sam & Max Freelance Police\". It was conceived as a point and click adventure game like its predessor except in a 3-D enviroment similar to the games \"Grim Fandango\" & \"Escape From Monkey Island\". This project had the co-director of the Hit the Road game Michael Stemmle leading the project along with Steve Purcell as creative consultant, with the plot being a string of six stories forming a climax. This time around it seem like this game was going to be a reality only for the whole thing to collapse when LucasArts pulled the plug on the sequel citing market/economic conditions and the loss of interest in adventure games as their reason for cancelling it. This news didn't please Sam & Max fans, Steve Purcell, & video game fans too lightly when there was an audience for it, but at the time of the game's cancellation it was when \"point and click\" adventure genre games were becoming fewer in numbers. For nearly a decade it seem like we wouldn't of see another adaption of Sam & Max in computer game or animated form a like. That all change when LucasArts license on Sam & Max expired in 2005, and Steve Purcell kindly gave the video game rights to the newly formed Telltale Games, formed by mostly LucasArts employees who either left or got fired from the company to form a company that does adventure games as a focus. The cancelled \"Sam & Max Freelance Police\" game helped inspired this very game we see right now \"Culture Shock\" the first episode of a six part episode season focusing on Sam & Max themselves. Sorry for the long ranting there, but I felt this was too good of a back story to ignore, I will now give out the plot outline. Culture Shock starts up with Sam & Max receiving a phone call from the commissioner giving them a case for the first time in a while. Their mission is to investigate the recent vandalism that is taking place in town. Graffiti art of a washed up 1970s TV star Brady Culture is seen on all of the building walls, while mysterious video tapes are being circulated via video dumping that are causing viewers to become hypnotised. The culprits are three washed 1970s former child stars the Soda Poppers(Peepers, Wizzer, & Specs). The three celebrities are not themselves as all three of them are overly obcess Brady despite that he was their rival during their heyday. The only way for Sam and Max to put an end to this nonsense is by some how trying to snap the Soda Poppers out of their trances, as well as learning the whereabouts and the motive of Brady Culture. This game is everything you'd want to see in an ideal Sam & Max 3-D adventure game. The game is on par with the \"Hit the Road\" game as oppose to the animated tv series. Which means the sub basement and the character Geek are omitted from the game. Believe me, I would of love to seen Geek as a supporting character for this game, but unfortunately royal rights and legal issues are often the reason we don't see characters from expanded universes cross over. But don't feel blue this game provided some new supporting characters to fill the void. Bosco who was not seen in \"Hit the Road\" is finely given an identity as a raspy voice conspiracy fearing black guy along with the new female character Sybil, a multi career woman who previously did tattoo art and is now a psycho-analyist. These two characters provide Sam and Max help in some form or another. Even if you never played the \"Hit the Road\" game or seen the tv show, you are able to enjoy this game without the previously said titles. This game helped put Telltale on the map of innovating game company and the years that followed, they were able to obtain rights to develop other properties. Culture Shock was a great start to the six part episode season that is known as the \"Save The World\" season, it's exsistence is proof that point and click adventure games are alive and well. If you are a fan of Sam & Max or like to play a fun adventure game then don't hesitate to play this."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506392763, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35214391", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198302433125", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1503110601, "num_games_owned": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 208}, "timestamp_updated": 1506392763, "received_for_free": false, "review": "fucking wew lads where to start off with this game\n\nthis is an amazing series and i love it to bits. i never thought that some dumb games about a dog and a rabbit interchanging dialogues and 4th wall breaking would be so charming\nthis game's soundtrack is also amazing too; that jazz is just mgemmmmmmm so fuck'ngi good i want to shove that sax up my ass\nthis game (and series in general) is really funny. y'know, i never thought i would get such amazing lines such as \"DIE, CAPITALIST OPPRESOR!\" in thsi kind of game. sam & max's charm is the fact that they're freelance *police* yet they abuse the fuck out of everything and potentially kill people while trying to save the day, and they end up saving the world. accidentally.\nanother great thing about it's comedy and something that hits right on is the characters, max is a crazy ass bunny who just wants to shoot things and sam is your lovable one of a kind dad that has a Sweet Detective Voice, overlooks things a lot\nthe animation for this game (taking in mind that this is a 2007 game) is excellent, lip syncing is (surprsingly) good, not gonna lie, they could've done more with it (making it more wacky, lively, etc.) to capture the charm of sam & max but it's a point & click so it's excuseable\n\nfavorite episode from this season is probably ep6, not gonna spoil anything but the bad guy was funny as hell, from first episode to the last that man is a fucking sunshine (haha). it also came with one of the best tracks in the game, moonscape (hand by hand with cogs in motion and consecutive office).\n\nin conclusion, this game is fucking wonderful and this is a GREAT way to start off with the sam & max series. please buy it. i threw all my money at it just because it \"looked interesting\" and i don't regret anything and i fucking wish i could've spent mroe money on it. buy it now"}]}
