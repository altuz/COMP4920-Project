If you love the Sam and Max type of humor, you will love this series.\n\nIf I'm going to mark points off for anything, its that the voices of Sam and Max have changed from the original LucasArts version, but after awhile they really start to own it and become the definitive Sam and Max voices.\n\nHilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable.
