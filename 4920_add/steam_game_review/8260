You will notice it in the graphics the most, as they are on same technical level, which would start to feel outdated in 2008. Then again, Season One was kinda outdated too. But hey, it still looks nice artistically.\n\nPositive thing that was added was hints system. You can choose how frequent you want to have main character throw hints at you, from none to often. They come from subtle to insultingly direct. Max may say to go somewhere else, he may hint you \"remember how we did it the last time\" or Sam may exclaim \"Ah, I get it, it's <something that directly solves the puzzle>\".\nIt's still helpful to have them as rare.\n\nAnd well, the first half of season isn't exactly amazing. It's original, yet something you kinda expect from comedical adventure games, while it also has adventure games sin: mini-games! Thanfully, they are easy and nice. Most hate cheap'n'hard minigames in such games after all.\nThen as the second half of season comes, it completely throws mini-games away and focuses on much more exciting setting. No spoilers, but you will get some fun things to do. Wink wink, time.\nAnd episodes felt a bit longer than expected too.\n\nSo, if you nejoyed Season One, it will be worth it.

They all sort of blend into one another in my mind, but I think season 2 was the most humorous and it certainly upped the craziness in terms of plot and the locations and situations that Sam & Max find themselves in. This season also introduced many new characters and started to phase out Bosco, who was really becoming tedious and tiresome for me over the course of the first season.\n\nBacking up a bit: these episodic games from Telltale are point-and-click adventure games with quirky characters and surreal humor. If you know anything about the Sam & Max characters, then you should already own all three seasons as you will most likely enjoy them.\n\nMy one complaint about the games overall is that there is a little too much going back and forth between the several locations that comprise each episode, trying to solve the main puzzle (or puzzles) in each location, in order to get something you'll need to go solve another location's puzzles.
