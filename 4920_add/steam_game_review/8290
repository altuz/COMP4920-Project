And if you thought they couldn't go further than season 1... you will be surprised.\n\nNote: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.\n\nHilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1480596112, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28118130", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198076910910", "num_reviews": 56, "last_played": 1480252330, "num_games_owned": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7}, "timestamp_updated": 1480596112, "received_for_free": false, "review": "just as good as the other Episodes\n(played in offlinemode)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1496214073, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "32079545", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198046882512", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1496213960, "num_games_owned": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 136}, "timestamp_updated": 1496214073, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This chapter is the best so far of Episode Two.
