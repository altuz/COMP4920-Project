And if you thought they couldn't go further than season 1... you will be surprised.\n\nNote: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.\n\nHilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1468786848, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499021", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "24378511", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198010082736", "num_reviews": 33, "last_played": 1468786801, "num_games_owned": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 297}, "timestamp_updated": 1468786848, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Timmy Two-Teeth is *censored* amazing!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1480596124, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "28118134", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198076910910", "num_reviews": 56, "last_played": 1480252739, "num_games_owned": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1480596124, "received_for_free": false, "review": "just as good as the other Episodes\n(played in offlinemode)"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1292707825, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "1872799", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197999133362", "num_reviews": 23, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 90}, "timestamp_updated": 1292707825, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Funny, random, and creative Sam & Max Season 2 will have you craving the next installment because of the unique suspenseful plots only experienced in episodic gaming -- a quality exemplified in all Telltale Games."}]}
