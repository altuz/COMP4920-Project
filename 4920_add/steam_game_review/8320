After escaping from the locust we find out that Grandma Ben's farm house has been destroyed they set onto compete in the Great cow race. While Phone bone tries to impress Thorn. Phoney and Smiley hatched a plan to win the Race for themselfs and take the bet winnings while we find out that the locust are still trying to catch and kill Phone Bone. So how is the sequel ? Overall i liked this more than the first act since i liked the puzzles more in this one cause they were a bit tougher to figure out.  The gameplay is still the same as the first one but this time you can switch to witch charecter you want to play on the fly. The script is funny and the game is very fun. But there are a few problems with the game. Its quite short and the biggest turn off for some people im gonna try to avoid spoiling it here but the game ends on a cliffhanger which is never resolved (unless youve read the comic books) Overall this is a very fun adventure game.

If you would like to see my review of the first one, go check the store and my review is there somewhere. This one is more difficult than the first one. Now, I cheated in this one. I used the help button throughout, making it only take me three hours to beat. Now, if yoiu don't use it, and have never played it, it should take you longer to beat it than the first one. Unlike the first one, this one has more difficulty and problem-solving skills. It even has the possibility of playing as Smiley Bone, as well as Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. In the first game, you couldn't switch between characters whenever you wanted to and you couldn't play as Smiley Bone. The thing about this is that every character you play as is connected in some way. So, when you do a certain thing with one character, it makes it hwlps one of the other characters. When you are finished doing everything possible with one character, you are unable to use that character anymore, so that it makes it simpler for you sto know what to do next. The mini games are minimal in this game, unlike the first one, and concentrates more on problem solving. It is much more entertaining than the first one, much more difficult, and much longer (if you don't use the help button).

Based on the second volume of the said title, the game picks up where the last one left off. The Bone cousins are adjusting to their current lives in the valley they all ended up in after being chased down by the swarm of locusts. They have resided at the cottage that's occupied by a kind elderly woman named Grandma Ben & her gorgous granddaughter Thorn. A spring fair was being held in the valley where the villagers and travellers from abroad gather together for import goods, carnival stands, and the yearly \"Great Cow Race\". Fone Bone who has a secret crush on Thorn will use the spring fair as an oppurtunity to express his love to Thorn. This attempt came to a halt when Thorn develops a relationship with a traveling beekeeper. Will Fone Bone be able to show Thorn how much she means to him is yet to be seen. Meanwhile Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone who are trying to pay their debt at the local pub run by the no-nonsense Lucius are crafting a scheme to get both of them out of debt. Phoney views the cow race as the oppurtunity to strike it rich and become the new owner of Lucius's pub in two swoops. Because Grandma Ben who is the only human contestant who par takes in the all bovine race is the popular choice to bet on. Phoney spreads rumors about Grandma Ben's health and claims to have a cow who is the fastest piece of beef in the whole valley. He goes all the way by making Grandma Ben appear to be ill and getting Smiley Bone to pose as a cow. Is this scam going to help Phoney's ambitions, or will it be as much of a failure as his Boneville election? This game is much more lengthy than the previous game as you play as all three Bone cousins each having a different story path that leads to one finale. There is the option to switch between the Bones in case you want to focus on a different cousin or if you feel stuck. The extra fair contenders weren't from the original comic volume, but they do feel like they originated from the Bone comics and helped made the game slightly longer than the predessor did. Keep in mind that this game wasn't intended as the last Bone game as it was open for a third game that was going to be based on the third volume \"Eye of the Storm\". The game in question never went into development and Telltale never went on record for the reason. Either due to low sales on the game or a falling out with Bone's creator Jeff Smith. But 10 years since this game's release, Telltale never went back to the Bone series for more games. A real shame too cause the good stuff in the comic series happens in volume 3, as it further develops the relationship between Fone Bone & Thorn, many secrets are revealed including the identity of the mysterious Hooded One of the Locusts. I can totally see all of the Bone comic volumes as episodic adventure games. But with the unlikelihood of more Bone games all we have is the anticipated animated film trilogy that's been in development for years. If it does officially get off the ground, I can see it being on par with the two Bone games which is all we have for now as a Bone related media. So if you have finished this game and are craving to know the rest of the story, read the comic series. It is a creative and wonderful comic series that will delight generations of readers to come. It will be the comic series I will read to my future kids some day as well."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501055267, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496539", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33803397", "votes_up": 0, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198087586831", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1504920400, "num_games_owned": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 16}, "timestamp_updated": 1501055267, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Deceit."}, {"votes_down": 15, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1416008120, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481922", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "12943327", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198046675266", "num_reviews": 606, "last_played": 1416007872, "num_games_owned": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1436319245, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]The sequel to \"Bone: Out from Boneville\"...?\nI say this in confusion because the first game ended with the Cow Race beginning, and this game starts with the characters not knowing anything from the first game except the cow race.
