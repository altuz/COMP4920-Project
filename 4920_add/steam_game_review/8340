It's pretty much a 5-part love letter to fans of the Homestar Runner cartoons. Just when I thought I had done everything, listened to every piece of dialogue, there was more. The entire game is pretty much a 1 hour Homestar cartoon starring Strong Bad. I was somewhat shocked that a Strong Bad video game even was a thing! The gameplay is what you would expect from a Point-and-Click game. Click the things, grab the important things, and talk to other characters. The feature that makes this game unique, though, is the dialogue system. whenever talking to any character, there is the option to bring up certain subjects, be \"nice', and insult said character. This feature is sometimes necessary to open up new areas or to discover the next objective. Overall, with witty jokes and countless inside references and easter eggs, I more than recommend this game to any Homestar Runner fan."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503416865, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500065", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34418575", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198094875886", "num_reviews": 3, "last_played": 1495292541, "num_games_owned": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 303}, "timestamp_updated": 1503416865, "received_for_free": false, "review": "10/10 would burninate again"}]}
