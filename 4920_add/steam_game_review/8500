Got boring real fast playing \"Warp Drive Active\" 90% watching ship travel from A to B. Might as well go mow the lawn while waiting for your ship to do 20 jumps except Auto pilot is too dangerous, so you have to manually sit at the keyboard clicking jump gates for 10 minutes of grinding excitement. If you want to build up a bigger ship you have to go through PvP areas to buy better ships, guns etc.\n\nCharacter generation is just a profile picture, doesn't mean anything in game. Can't do anything with planets, you can literally can run into planets, stars and asteroids and nothing happens. You will need to google some missions to work out how to complete them as ingame instructions from the agents are a vague.\n\nI enjoyed the game playing initial PvE but unfortunately the whole game is PvP everywhere and with plenty of scum players who just open fire on you without warning in ships that massively outclass you. Also if you join a clan you may find it means you are now a target for PvP ganking by opposing clans everywhere, even while still doing noob missions. I spent hours grinding and buying stuff to create ships still doing noob missions and got ganked coming out of jumps without having a chance to run or fire a shot so many times. My final straw was building up a next level ship and getting spawn ganked by a clan who think 12 vs 1 noob is fun, never even got to fire a shot or a chance to run. Lost interest after my $30 intro subscription month ended, you have to subscribe to own certain ships and it seems if you let subscription lapse you lose them, so no subscription from me for this.\n\nIf you like ganking or being ganked, its the game for you."}, {"votes_down": 36, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504808032, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535366", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 21, "recommendationid": "34799670", "votes_up": 59, "comment_count": "4", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038976176", "num_reviews": 36, "last_played": 1449655364, "num_games_owned": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 151}, "timestamp_updated": 1504808032, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Here's a different kind of review.\n\n\nI played for two hours, and this game made me feel like I was doing my taxes.\n\n\nI hate that, but depending on who you are you might love it.

Though with alts ect that time is probably less then the truth. . . I love this game for the new plays it may seem daunting but the key is, is getting into the right group from the get go.  Eve does very little hand holding and its a dog eat dog world out there. . . But once you get rolling its an addictive expirence where I play for the next conflict the next fight.  Pvp gets its not about who has the biggest ship its all about knowing your enemy understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your ship and knowing when to run and when to commit to the fight.   All I have done in my time on this game is pvp I have risen in the ranks to become not only a proficent pvp pilot but Fleet commander as well or FC for short.  Id recommend this game to players with patience who truly enjoy team work.  My best advice is never fly a ship you can't afford to replace and get used to losing your ships early if you have any interest in pvp.   If industry mining and pve are more your pace id still follow the same rules. . .  Eve can be unforgiving at times but also can be a rewarding awesome game to play where i have met some of my best real life friends.

Now if you plan on starting out find a corp, this game is not as unfriendly to noobs as you might think for there are hundreds of corps willing to take you in and teach you the game and how to be sucessful.

Yes the game has issues and I will agree some things PVE wise need to get fixed but all in all it is a well built game that has many improvments still comming.
