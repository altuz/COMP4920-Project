From its atmosphere, to its beautifully designed characters, to its twisted, heart-wrenching plot, I give it 10s across the board. People will argue that the combat is repetitive and boring, and the AI has a below-average IQ and whatnot, but that's not what the game's about, is it? It's about the story, and a story it has. A fantastically crafted, exquisitely executed, and emotionally draining story. Every ounce of effort the developers put into this game is evident, and I repect them for that. I can't say the same for many of the games coming out today. Even the game's comedic aspect was elaborately designed. Hell, I legitimitely laughed out loud during some parts. And laugh as I did, I knew less than an hour later I would be on the verge of crying. I didn't even know I had some of the emotions that this game brought out of me. Even the credits were fun to watch, the first part of which I spent with my mouth wide open, processing the end that I had just witnessed. I don't want to spoil any of it for new players, so I'll leave it at that. In the end, this is one of, if not my favorite game of all time. If only there was more content, a DLC, perhaps...

I would dread a lot of the combat sequences just because I just wanted to know what happened next. The game kinda fights itself because the plot is so fascinating that if feels as though it interrupts itself. And some mechanics like having to shoot the robot patriots in the back was just annoying because it's an fps and it's hard to really make that work without doing  some stupid enemy circling.\nTo be frank, you don't deserve this game.
