You can decide from multiple leaders what you want to play as. All leaders have different so called bonus. For example Rome has faster border growth than other civilizations. Maps art style is good. People like to say that Civilization VI has worse art style than Civ V but I like both. I can't really point out any flaws on gameplay compared to other strategy games since I mostly have my strategy experiense from Civ V but like overall I like the gameplay it is smooth and well made. And for example you can use hills to make you units stronger compared to enemy unit which is as a tactic really rewarding. \n\nIf you asked me to rate this game on tier 1-10 I would say 10/10.

It will absolutely take you days to finish your first game. It will continue to take you days to complete subsequent games. This is a wonderful strategy game that rewards you well for playing to your leader's strengths, whatever they are.\n\nPros:\n- Can \"run\" on a potato. The load times are long.\n- So much depth, but you can still pick any civ and hop in a low-difficulty game without knowing everything.\n- Graphics are pretty decent, and you can crank them down if you like.\n- The tips throughout play are super helpful when you come back from having had the game on the shelf for a couple months.\n- Mods are fun, you can't get achievements with them on, but they're worth it sometimes.\n\nCons:\n- Can be quite slow. There's a lot to process, especially given the AI's computational needs.\n- Multiplayer games are super hard to finish in a reasonable timeframe.\n- Some of the tips are just obnoxious.\n- The game is definitely still buggy. You will run into them, I promise.\n\nIt's a fun game. If you're interested in Civ, and you're looking to grab this as your first entry into your collection, it's a great buy. From what I hear the AI is much weirder in Civ 6, and much of the community is in Civ 5, so it's still not a bad buy at all. That said, Civ 6 is beautiful, and offers a lot of gameplay improvements/tweaks. If you've played earlier Civ games or other turn-based strategy games, go for it, you won't be disappointed, just have patience if you run into any of the cons listed above."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504589684, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34750289", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197965197111", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1507146324, "num_games_owned": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "playtime_forever": 48641}, "timestamp_updated": 1504589684, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best Civ game i have played.
