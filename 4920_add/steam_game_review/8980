"So after doing the review for Borderlands 2(that you can check out as well) I thought it's time to do a review for the prequel Borderlands 1 which i actually enjoyed and still enjoy a bit more than Borderlands 2.So lets talk about the story which is just  as medicore as the story of Borderlands 2.The graphics are also of course worse than it's sequel.But I don't really care about the graphics in games which also has something to do that i have a shit computer.So after this you probably thinking: Why does he like Borderlands 1 more than Bl 2?.Well first of all I absolutely love the weapon balance system in this game.I also  like the classic chest farming.You don't need to farm bosses for specific weapons because they drop shit.The Knoxx Armory Glitch should be known by the community.It makes this game so addicting and played to this day.Also the leveling and the story isn't that long which I also like (don't know why).The DLC's are also great even tho Moxxies Underdome can be a little boring and repetitive.\n\nSo I would absolutely recommend this game just like Borderlands 2.\nIt's a great game even tho there are some flaws.It makes the game just more entertaining and nostalgic."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505143182, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase":

Much of my experience lies with the Xbox 360 version, where I wasted 1900 hours on my first Roland character farming for the best possible end game loot, only to all be lost when I converted to PC. Despite this, I bought the game again because of how much fun it is.\n\nOnce you venture out from the first \"hub\" location of Fyrestone, the game starts to get good very quickly, aside from Mad Mel (to this day I still cheese through because cars are made of paper). You can choose to play as one of four characters, all of which are super fun to play, my favorite being Brick the Beserker. None of the classes are better than one another, aside from the Hunter for PVP (He has a skill that completely negates shield protection), but that was not a focus of the game.\n\nThe main drive of the game is the loot system, which was a drug for me, hence the 1900 hours on the Xbox 360 for one character. The feeling that you get when finding that overpowered weapon is addicting. That said, it almost becomes a requirement to do some grinding for weapons by opening chests multiple times. Some weapons are useless, such as the Edrian and Rocket classes. They fall flat when compaired to the other weapon types.\n\nSpeaking of the other weapon types, some are much more powerful than others it almost becomes a must have. Such as the Anarchy class for SMGS, which are bullet hoses that do massive damage (x4 Multiplier), tearing even the largest foe to pieces in seconds. Compair this to a Thumper class SMG, that has low recoil but shoots very slowly, giving the enemy time to write their will and eat their last supper before they die.\n\nThe story is alright, though I may be biased from so many subsequent playthroughs that I end up rushing through the main missions as fast as the game will allow me to get back to the side quests. These are not required to progress through the game, but they give a level boost without the need of grinding. Ignoring all side quests will require you to grind enemies to level up a could of times. I end up 100% completing all quests anyway, so this is a minor complaint from me but may irk some people. \n\n! SPOILER WARNING ! On a final note about the story, the ending [spoiler] Is garbage, it made the entire experience seem like a waste. The final boss fight is incredibly easy unless you have very crap loot.    [/spoiler]\n\nMy gripes with the game begin with the visuals, this game has not aged well. Most of the games locations are brown deserts or rusty townships devoid of much colour. Much of the environment isnt well detailed, yet it does not run well in areas with many objects. (My pc is an i5-4670 with GTX 1070 Stock, and I drop down to 25 fps sometimes, max settings 1440p) Most of the areas though are barren, resulting in a smooth 90 FPS for me.\n\nThere is also a strange FPS lock at 62, which will cause screen tearing on 60hz monitors. I have one that is 144hz, and the cap can be removed in the game's files with no ill effects to gameplay. There is also a lack of a FOV slider, with the default FOV being 60 in this game. I get headaches with low FOV, so this is a big issue for me. Once again this can be altered in the game's files, but the FOV is reset when entering a car. My fix for this is to bind a change FOV command to W so it resets whenever I start moving.\n\nMy issues with the game do not deter from the experience when fixed, granting this game a solid 8.5/10. One of my favorite games ever made.\n\nSHORT OVERVIEW OF DLCS\n\n[u] The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned\t[/u]\n- Very good DLC, funny characters and entertaining quests. Highly recomended.\n\n[u] The Secret Armory of General Knoxx\t[/u]\n- The missions are entertaining, but there is too much driving. Recomended because this has everything needed for entertaining end game.\n\n[u] Claptrap's Robot Revolution\t[/u]\n- Great main missions, with side missions that are not as interesting. Some of the achievements are grind fests, recomended if in GOTY edition or on sale.\n\n[u] Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot\t[/u]\n-This is NOT a good DLC, only useful for the bank feature. Only get this if you buy the GOTY edition. The definition of grind fest, with no saves. (I completed this DLC on Xbox 360, took 3 days of 10 hour play sessions).\n\nedit; do not write reviews at 5:45 AM, too many mistakes."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1507018795, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35439327", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041518605", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1334991600, "num_games_owned": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1864}, "timestamp_updated": 1507018795, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game but $30 for a game made in 2009?

I like the fact that it is open world and you can go and search and loot and decimate the enemies or anyone who satnds infront of you. \n2. The visuals are different and intriging but after a while it does get noticable boring, the enemies are good and challenging but not alot of variety into different enemies. \n3. The guns are good but they missed out on a huge oppurtunity\n\nCons: \n1.The world is ok but the huge problem is you cant fast travel to a building or a location - you can only travel to a section on the map where a building might be (if you remember) \n2. the enemies are either too weak or too hard and they respawn in the same location you are after 10 minutes. So if you play this game watch out for that. \n3. The wildlife is good but just imagine dogs with arnor, and mega huge bats. thats it, you then get bandits, army, outlaws, phycos, everyone trying to kill you.\n4. With the guns there is no modifying them. No changing there appearance, no changing the sights, the accesories, the magazine size (you have to unlock skills for that). What you pick up is all you can have, so you can have a SMG firing at 57 damage but terrible accuracy and you cant change anything or upgrade it. \n5. The profiency was never really explained (the more times you use a gun the higher the profiency is) i think - i could not notice a difference. \n\nit is an ok game - but i think they have missed out on so many oppurtunities, like full world and map visuals, not just the section you are in, the modifications of guns, not just pick up and thats all you have, the vehicle mods, lack of mods i mean, all you can do is choose 1 - 3 cars and a colour, wow. \n\nyoure on Pandora a different planet from Earth but still the guns hold the  same size magazine, the gravity is different but not by much, the enemies are easy and hard, pending, \n\nIf you wana buy this game wait for it to be 50% off or more, cause honestly theres really no reason to go back for a 2nd play through - ive started one and just went - meh - there are other games to play.\n\n6/10"}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506814277, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473934", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35357558", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093190974", "num_reviews": 78, "last_played": 1506814093, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_forever": 39}, "timestamp_updated": 1506814704, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Boring, repetitive and generic gunplay, bland characters and horrible optimization.\n\nalso;\n\nboo hoo muh poor little \"plot-essential\" robot is huuurt so fix it with this conviniently placed repair kit that is conviniently marked with the compass"}]}
