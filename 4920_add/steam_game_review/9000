If you're looking to \"experience\" Wolfenstein 3D in it's entirety, my suggestion would be to play the first three episodes of Wolfenstein 3D and be done with it. The rest just felt like a waste of my time.\n\n- You pretty much have to use ECWolf or some other source port in order to properly play this game on a modern PC\n- Spear of Destiny only offers new levels, enemies and reskins. There are no new weapons, you still only have access to the three same weapons from Wolfenstein 3D\n- The game gets repetitive really fast\n- There are three campaigns (Spear of Destiny and the two missions packs)), and each of them has the exact same ending recycled from Spear of Destiny. They recycle the very same boss enemis through all of the three campaigns.\n- The level design can be outright retarded at times. For a person that is not interested in finding all of the secrets in their first playthrough, some of the levels in this game were infuriating. Very often the only way to find that key you've been looking for for the past five minutes is to spam your USE key along each and every wall you come across. Sometimes the secret moving walls can be at reasonable locations, like at the end of corridors behind previously locked doors, but sometimes they are scattererd around the map in completely random locations. I would be fine with the secret doors being in illogical places as long as the player was not forced to go out and look for them if they wanted to progress to another level"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500288895, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497915", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33605384", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197961547407", "num_reviews": 43, "last_played": 1500287520, "num_games_owned": 1031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1500288895, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Get ECWolf if you want to play this properly.
