And that is correct, the game is well, quite elegant and confident. It is an old game, but almost nothing in it really feels dated or old. It is pure and no-nonsense in almost all it does. There is NO such beast as a perfect game, nor a game for everyone and RTCW is no exception. But honestly, it is a title that understands what it is and what it wants to be. It is an action first person shooter that is proud of what it is, warts and all. One with stupid but at the same time glorious paranormal and science fiction elements. A mechanic heavy creation, but one that does not shy away from world building and gets the so far established tenants of storytelling in gaming surprisingly well.\n\nAlternate WW2 is a setting it takes to its heart and it is definitely a game I\u2019d consider being made with care, attention and love. And personally, at least for me it is one of the finest first person shooter titles of all time.\n\nPresentation: Nothing bad here. It has a lot of options, runs well and was damn excellently optimized for its time. Very good art style that ties in all the game's environments. Excellent sound effects and great music are essential and the developers knew that. A fan patch can be easily applied to help the game use newer aspect ratios, but that is to be expected. It is a PC game and it shows. 19/20\n\nStory: Surprisingly, the game understands how to use its genre and medium really well. Do NOT expect complex themes or characters or ideas (even by video game standards), but do expect a surprisingly involving and well thought out plot with solid world building that uses the medium\u2019s strengths to boost itself. It knows it is an action game and is damn proud of it, unlike the movies we call FPS games nowadays. 14/20\n\nGameplay: Elegance, simplicity\u2026 unexpected depth. I can say only good things about it. Thankfully many good linear shooters like Metro have learned their lessons from RTCW. It is not extremely complex but it is very well balanced and thought out. Polished to a shine few games attain. 19/20\n\nAudio & Visuals: For its time it was a Crysis or Doom 3 level event. Extremely good looking by 2001/2002 standards and very scalable. Pioneered some interesting lighting and animation techniques as well as many cinematic special effects. Even used an early form of tessellation. Of course it has aged, but the fact that the game\u2019s atmosphere will not diminish even 15 years later is a testament to both the it\u2019s art department as well as its tech team. 20/20\n\nLasting Appeal: It is a linear shooter, true, but the replayability due to the excellent level design is top notch and can potentially give a player a decent amount of extra content. A dedicated modding community as well as some excellent multiplayer (which is now almost entirely moved onto Enemy Territory: Wolfenstein ) does give the game great extra staying power. Lots of maps and mini campaigns exist for those who look for them. Some quite decent\u2026 others not so much. Still, it is a game built to feel complete and for PC Gamers. 18/20\n\nOverall: 90/100, A classic of its genre!\nOriginal Review link by me: https://www.gnd-tech.com/content/1044-Return-to-Castle-Wolfenstein-Venerable-Classic-of-the-FPS-genre/view/1"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506120451, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35139323", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198056425588", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1506704153, "num_games_owned": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 115, "playtime_forever": 450}, "timestamp_updated": 1506150717, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The Wolfenstein series is one of the, if not the, most underrated fps series. Despite being the very first it gets overshadowed by id's other \"behemoths\" in the fps genre, Doom and Quake. RTCW it's actually a very fun game that besides being extremely cheap even when it's not on sale, not many people know about. Why you ask? Well to put it simply, [b]it's broken[/b]. It doesn't work by default on newer pcs (sure, it runs on them and the title screen is fine but everything else including browsing the settings run at a 0,95 frames per second). This is because the engine that this game runs on doesn't support the newer graphic cards. However, fans actually made mods that fix everything and added widescreen support for the single player but there is not a universal mod to download and if you aren't experienced with modding then it would be quite difficult to get everything to make the game work. That is until today. I actually gathered every non-conflicting bug fixing mod and uploaded it here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B648h7Bl5aUuM2ZoU0tjQzF3aG8 so anyone will be able to play. This collection makes the game run at 120 fps fully hd while keeping everything else the same [spoiler]It also contains my save files cuz I was lazy and didn't remove them[/spoiler].\n The only thing that you need to do is go to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common and paste it. Press yes when it asks you to replace the files and then  start playing :). Be careful though, while single player supports all resolutions the multiplayer will crash if the resolution is set higher than 1024x768. If this happens then delete the folder and download it again. Speaking of which, the multiplayer does work but there are no servers online (at least in my region) so basically you can't play. If you really want to though you can get Wolfenstein Enemy Territory, a differend game, which is an enhanced version of RTCW's multiplayer. This game has a surprisingly big community even though it's pretty old.\n [b][h1]HOLY SHIT YOU MADE IT UNTILL THE END[/h1][/b] \nThanks for reading my \"review\" [spoiler]it's more of a how to[/spoiler].

The gameplay reminded me a lot of JKII till I noticed it was used the same engine. Dying in this game rarely feels cheap and gunplay is satisfying.

The story is nothing much and just gives you a reason to kill nazis and the undead in various settings. Another dissapointment was the final boss. There was no build up towards that fight and it just happens. It's also SUPER easy compared to another boss fight. \n\nNote: if you want experience this game properly, I recommend installing the unofficial patch to play it in 1080P.\n\nIn the end this a great FPS I'd recommend everyone who is looking for a classic game."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506181927, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502134", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35157085", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198344082405", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507130710, "num_games_owned": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "playtime_forever": 2132}, "timestamp_updated": 1506181927, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is great i have put countless hours into it, it has great miisions and a multiplayer. this game is not very big so it should work on every PC, i am playing this on a normal laptop."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505892497, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501466", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35079253", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198170186818", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1505891953, "num_games_owned": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 522}, "timestamp_updated": 1505892497, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you like killing Nazi soldiers, demons and super soldiers, stealing hot and steamy Nazi food, and destroying every picture of Hitler in Germany, then you will love this game. \n\nThis game is a pretty good FPS. The stealth mechanics are a little broken, but overall this is worth playing. I would rank this up there close to Half Life 1. Some missions are brutally difficult, but it's still worth playing if you like a challenge. If you don't mind the simple charm of blocky graphics from the late 1990s and early 2000s, you will probably enjoy this interesting adventure into the Nazi occult universe. The guns are fun and interesting. Some of the reload animations are cool to look at. The story is super far fetched, action-packed, and interesting. And if you're a Call of Duty fan, you'll get to experience the ID Tech 3 engine in all its splendor, since this very same engine is behind Call of Duty 1. \n\nDefinitely worth a playthrough if you're a hardcore FPS fan and enjoy old school FPS games.\n\n(I am assuming multiplayer is dead. But there may be mods that keep it alive. You can also play Wolfenstein Enemy Territory for free from third party websites if you want to get a feel for how multiplayer would work for this game.
