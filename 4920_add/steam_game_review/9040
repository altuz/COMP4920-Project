Some atmosphere is lost, and the soundtrack isn't quite as timeless this time around, but the game makes up for it with three new enemies, three new items, and three mostly useful new weapons. \n\nThe new weapons are the Mjolnir, a hammer which delivers a strike equivalent to nearly three Axe hits if you use it as a melee weapon and that can, at an ammo cost (cells), generate an electric area of effect component if you hit geometry instead of an enemy; the Proximity Launcher, a weapon that shoots explosives which detonate when enemies come near them and which deal slightly less damage than regular grenades; and the Laser Cannon, a powerful alternative to the Thunderbolt with fast, ricocheting projectiles. The new items are the Wetsuit, an improved Biosuit that allows you to swim much faster and to resist electric damage; the Empathy Shield, a temporary powerup that reflects a large part of the damage you take back to your assailant; and the most interesting of all, the Horn of Conjuring, which will summon a monster (or monsters) to fight alongside you. They can come in handy with some luck or patience, but their AI and pathfinding are rather poor, and you will eventually have to turn on them if you want to max the kills for the level. The new enemies are the Gremlin, which are weak but often come in packs, and on top of that can steal your current weapon with a melee attack (you can have it back if you kill them) to use against you; the Centroid, which are highly mobile, resistant robotic scorpions that attack with dual streams of nails; and lastly the Spike Mine, an annoying, flying suicide bomber which resists explosives and is especially weak to both your nailguns. The end boss, Armagon, is also all-new. \n\nThis expansion's campaign is roughly as long as the original game, even if it has three episodes in contrast to the original's four. I particularly enjoyed the fact that there's an entire episode dedicated to \"techbase\" levels in Scourge of Armagon, with lots of Grunts and Enforcers on patrol. There's an unique Doom-like feel to them, and throughout the whole game you find a lot of impressive pushing of the engine's limits with inventive moving geometry (such as a collapsing mine), effects, traps, etc. Highly recommended."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503446784, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424935", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34426558", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197986608064", "num_reviews": 95, "last_played": 1503446729, "num_games_owned": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1503446784, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\nSuper awesome game, horrible broken steam release, no music, and rainbow colors just to make sure it's unplayable"}]}
