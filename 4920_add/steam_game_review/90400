Another review already mentioned that this game is confusing to categorize - who is this game aimed at?  The puzzles are simplistic and yet would not be appropriate for children, yet as an adult playing the game, I found that the narrator is condescending to the point of irritation.  In addition, the pacing is irritating.  Two lines of dialogue followed by another puzzle would be frustrating enough, but each puzzle is prefaced by a short piece of dramatic music (the same every time) and a bland and completely unnecessary title screen.  You're then given the instructions, then the puzzle, and then more time is taken up with a screen portraying a nondescript part of the village while three ducks, for reasons unexplained, fly past while the narrator drags out the 'suspense' by narrating \"let's see if you got it right\" or whatever and more 'dramatic' music plays and you realize that the dramatic music is the perfect background to your dawning realization of just how many of these time-wasting moments you'll have to endure if you continue the game.  I wish game makers would come to an agreement that putting in time padding scenes/dialogue is only going to work if it's not the SAME time padding scenes/dialogue every. single. time.

Oh, let's wait before you get told whether it's correct. You're done with the riddle? Let's wait before you get back to the game.
