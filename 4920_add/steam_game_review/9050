Now I'm playing it with the 'Doom 3 Redux mod', which doesn't touch gameplay at all, it simply adds cooler sounds and better textures, nothing wrong upgrading a 2004 game visually, so I definitely recommend adding this mod if you never played the game before, still even without the mod, it's perfect, but I think this mod really modernizes it, better gun sounds (blasting imps and zombies with a shotgun has never been so fun), better graphics, better textures, gameplay unaffected = perfect. \n\nAnyways, what to say about the game. It's truly a real DOOM game, it starts slow like the Knee Deep in Dead episode from DOOM 1993 and slowly picks up the pace. You'll face the same monster traps, hallways, UAC base, Mars, Hell, the same demons, keycard hunting, lockers, maze levels, action you experienced in the original DOOM. \n\nTo me it's a real DOOM game, and never understood the haters who say it isn't. It has horror elements yes, but this game is NOT a survival horror game. You don't \"survive\" scrounging for supplies and setting up camp fires, hiding, surviving, you take that shotgun and blast those demon f.ucks straight to hell! DOOM guy is badass in this game as well, don't let people who don't understand DOOM tell you otherwise. I've always enjoyed it and just recently bought it on steam again because DOOM 3 I bought back in 2004 is still in my hometown. \n\nI enjoy all DOOMs, and DOOM 2016 is a great game as well and a real DOOM game as well don't get me wrong, but don't exclude this masterpiece from the series saying it sucks. I say try it! If you don't like it, you can always refund it. \n\nAlso, this game has some crazy mods as well, people were very creative with it so when you finish the game you can play numerous cool mods, there's even a mod where someone remade Quake 1 in this, it owns!"}]}
