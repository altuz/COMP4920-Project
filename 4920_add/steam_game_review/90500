The graphics are very nice, I like the setup and it could have been so much more had it (as with many games) had some love and ownership attention instead of the typical abandoment. I have not had any of the tech problems I see mentioned (I'm an AMD, Radeon, win 10 gamer). Have had zero crashes, and the the expansion works fine, had no problems or bugs in the time i've played it. My only complaint is at this early stage I do not see any \"endless\" skirmish mission. The longest being some \"kill 15 units\" mission. Perhaps more searching will reveal a longer lasting one. The skirmish missions are too short, with a great many of them having turn limits and other \"limit\" consierations that really kills it. It's this game's only fatal flaw IMO. Workshop would have been great as this game does have nice potential and I have had quite a bit of fun learning (It does have a learning curve) and playing it. Certianly worth it on sale considering I have had no bugs or issues at all and it is quite challlenging, and as mentioned, the art work is just beautiful, I so wish it would get some revival attention and tweaking, which, due to some of the reviews, gave me pause. So far i've found none. Recommended 6-7/10."}]}
