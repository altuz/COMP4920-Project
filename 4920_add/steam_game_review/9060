Same class system, same basic-blue-green-both weapon selection, same hub-based gameplay. But while HeXen II has far more visual variety and slightly more coherently delivered paper-thin plot, its predecessor was considerably more fun to play.\n\nI'm not entirely sure why that is. Maybe it's because of its embracement of old-school fantasy camp rather than a halfhearted effort to present an epic advenure by making each hub world the theme park version of some ancient culture (Aztec, Egypt, Grome) to the point that the writers intermittently forgot that the Egypt level wasn't actually supposed to be Egypt. Maybe because even if the puzzles made no sense you could still usually figure them out eventually by dragging your face along every surface on the map. Maybe because the enemies actually died when you hit them instead of even the lowliest archer tanking a dozen shots before dropping and making combat an inherently entropic endeavour.\n\nHeXen II is also a lot stingier with its healing items than previous, which combined with such durable enemies means that every single fight will leave you with fewer resources than before, which over the course of the game left me so dry by the Grome level that I just started cheating so I could see the rest of the game and throw it in the bin. Didn't help that random points would bug out, like when I got stuck in the Cathedral because I kept missing a key item I needed to succeed because the teleporter spat me out off the ledge where it sat, so I didn't even know it existed until I looked it up.\n\nRegardless, my ultimate takeaway is that HeXen II isn't as fun as HeXen, which itself was only \"okay\" at best. Don't bother with this, play something like Rune instead of you want retro fantasy hacko-slasho."}, {"votes_down": 18, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1503775476, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461695", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34512496", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198403769223", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1503719114, "num_games_owned": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 26}, "timestamp_updated": 1503775476, "received_for_free": false, "review": "The game is good for the time it was from but now days the game is way to complicated to play to the point where its almost unplayable without help. the game get a 3/10"}]}
