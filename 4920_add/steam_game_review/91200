You can select different armored vehicles and upgrade them, and you have a commander you play as on the ground who can run around to collect pick-ups and such.\n\nIt's more complicated than it would seem, but not super intricate. I had a nice time playing it and do recommend it if you want something of a twist on the tower defense premise in which you're assaulting enemy towers and trying to preserve your units and approach differently to avoid damage as best as possible. Nice stuff."}]}
