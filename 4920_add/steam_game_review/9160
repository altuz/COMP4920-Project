Master Levels consist of high quality levels for their time with the intention of being challenging and difficulty. Of course the difficult is easy compared to the Final Doom IWADs, Plutonia and TNT, and modern WADs pretty much make all the levels pretty much puts the levels to shame. Considering that 1994 WADs aren't known for their quality and seeing that we're paying for what is basically community map pack of WADs, well they must be good, right? For the most part, yes actually, and seeing that this comes for free if you buy Doom 2, I really can't complain since it's not like you'll pay much for it. Doom 2 is already enough of a great game and having more Doom to play is welcoming.\n\nAs for the levels themselves, they are for the most part solid and enjoyable, albeit some are a bit sloppy. Only level I do not like is the secret level, and to spoil it, it's just a room full of Cyberdemons with nothing else to it. So much for wanting to play a secret level. Other than that, I can't say a whole lot other than that it's free for buying Doom 2, you can run the WADs on any source port these days (don't complain about my lack of playtime), and of course, you don't need to launch it through Steam as the original Doom is DRM free.\n\nI should say this, if you want to make playing the levels more convenient and a 20+1 level episode instead of multiple PWADs that almost all replace MAP01: Entryway, try out this tool, it bundles all the WADs in one WAD file and you can launch it with DOOM2.wad with the episodes Hell on Earth and Master showing up, Master being the Master Levels. The tool is linked here.\n\nDownload for Master Levels Patch: http://maniacsvault.net/projects\n\nLast thing to say about the Master Levels is that it comes with Maximum Doom, which can be summarized as WAD Shovelware with 1,830 amaetur PWADs, which includes 191 PWADs for Doom 1/Ultimate Doom, 1629 Doom 2 PWADs, and surprisingly, 10 PWADs for Heretic. May seem great with all those WADs to play, right? Well no, it's not anything worth checking out as the amount of low quality WADs is astounding. Sure we have more WADs now than then, but seriously, to think Maximum Doom is officially licensed shovelware and pretty much forgotten since no one really wants to mention it. Yes, back then the internet wasn't all that great so having a disc full of WADs sounds great in theory. But even back then the quality is just horrific, and it's even worse now seeing that it's mind-boggling to think people can make some of the stupidest mistakes possible. HOMs everywhere, texture problems, poorly designed levels that aren't even playtested by the looks of it, and simple mistakes breaking whole maps (How can you mess up a square room?!). The quality speaks for itself when one of the maps is a room with the letter G. Yeah, let's praise G the map. Doesn't help many of the Doom 2 levels are Doom 1 levels poorly converted over to Doom 2, which means more texture issues, perhaps even missing textures if I can recall. Also most maps seem to be made with deathmatch in mind, but who wants to play deathmatch with god awful maps like these, especially when they don't even play right on single-player as it is. Maximum Doom only exists to go talk back at D!Zone, but really, neither are good and Maximum Doom being officially licensed means nothing as the quality of the WADs remains poor.\n\nI don't recommend checking out Maximum Doom but if you really want to see what it is, well there is an archive of all the Maximum Doom levels for you to play, all 3,943 levels with some copyrighted music and sounds here and there (from the SImpsons and Monty Python for example). Funny enough, some of the level designers involved with the Master Levels did not got there levels in the package, but they got it in Maximum Doom instead. Whether they're good or not, I wouldn't know since I have not gone through more than 50 levels of Maximum Doom. Anyways, play the 20+1 levels of the Master Levels, they are worth your time to play. Maximum Doom, just skip it unless you are really bored or just want to experience some abysmal WADs, but that is your choice after all. I should note that the Heretic levels are not in this download but not like you really want to play 10 crappy PWADs, especially on a game like Heretic, why would you.\n\nMaximum Doom Download: https://archive.org/details/maximum_doom"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500851593, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485577", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "33754930", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254467609", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1500853169, "num_games_owned": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 78}, "timestamp_updated": 1500851593, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Overkill?
