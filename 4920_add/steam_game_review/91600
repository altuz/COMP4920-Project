I picked it as well and also bought the DLC maps.\n\nTastes in games are subjective, but for whatever reason this one really hit the spot for me.  It's not going to be the best FPS or best puzzle game, but the first Sanctum has it's own niche and unique style, that it earns its place out there.\n\nUnlike Sanctum 2 the enemies don't fight back.  You can get up and close and chase them, or occupy higher spots in strategic areas and get better hits.  The waves that come out in lines on the ground, or flying above in the air, try to reach and diminish the core - if enough reach it, the level drops to zero and the match is over.  The action can be intense but around the edges of it, there is a light heartedness, such as the free Christmas DLC map.\n\nThought it's hard to find online matches, the gameplay is great as different people can bring different weapons and towers, to split up the workload and to create a successful map.  I think if you buy this game and host some maps you'll find that there are other people out there who will hop on."}]}
