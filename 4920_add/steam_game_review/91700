Didn't like it until I made it about halfway through New Eden. Then it starts becoming awesome & slightly addicting.\n\nEdit: I found this statement in a forum thread & found it to be highly appropriate. Definitely feel like a bad person for reposting something, but all credit goes to the author, Paul Debrion.\n\n\nPaul Debrion  has E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy Feb 2, 2014 @ 12:23pm      \nI'll say that you are not all that wrong that this game is \"so deep yet so shallow\" and you're concerns that this is mostly a co-op ,and I would add random non-campaign single-player, platform are not entirely incorrect either.\n\nHowever, I'll also have to say what may or may not be a bit more bad news depending on who you are. Issues that are obviously bugs aside, the way E.Y.E. is paced and how it plays are not really a \"mistake\", in that sense the game is the way it's supposed to be.\nIf that's a problem then there's a good chance this game isn't what you think it is.\n\n\nTo try to clarify what I mean by this, I'll give a slightly shortened version of a an explanation I've posted elsewhere.\n\n\nIf you really really want to understand why E.Y.E. is the way it is and have time to spare then I would recommend the following:\n-Re-install Half-Life 1 and install Sven Co-op and play a few maps of that. \n-After that install another Half-Life 1 mod called Syndicate Black Ops, which is from the developer of E.Y.E. and is pretty much its prequel, and play a few levels of that as well. \n-After that go play some E.Y.E. again. There\u2019s a good chance that E.Y.E. \"design\" will then suddenly make sense, and its intentions will probably turn out to be not quite as lofty as you might have thought.\n\nThat's probably a lot of trouble to go through so here's a quick summary of sorts.\n\nE.Y.E. is NOT a Deus Ex, STALKER, or Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines and it was never meant to be. It sort of reaches in that direction but it starts from a very different place.\nInstead, E.Y.E. sort of \"evolved\" out of an odd subset of old FPS co-op mods that were sort of environment where aggressive respawning enemies and constantly being under attack are commonplace. Some people genuinely liked that sort of play, and for better or worse that's sort of why E.Y.E. has inherited that mentality.\n\nI suppose the best way I can try to describe E.Y.E. without the above mentioned context is that it\u2019s \u201clike a Serious Sam from an alternate world where games like Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and STALKER became really big and sold as as much as Call of Duty does in our world\u201d.\n\nIt has RPG mechanics, various tools, a hacking system, inventory management, leaning, and all sorts of mechanics we associate with more \"deep and sophisticated\u201d games, but these are just means to an end and in this case they are not matched with \u201cdeep and sophisticated\u201d ends, and that can be somewhat confusing at first.\nIn this case they\u2019re all there to enhance the end objectives of \u201ckilling tons of enemies\u201d and \u201cbeing a badass\u201d. \n\nE.Y.E. has respawning enemies because if they didn\u2019t respawn you\u2019d run out of things to fight.\nStealth is not that fleshed out because stealth is not intended as a gameplay approach by itself, it\u2019s just another tool to help you kill more dudes and for that the game\u2019s version of stealth works quite well.\nHacking lets you do a lot of interesting things, but it\u2019s also meant to be yet another tool you use to be a badass killing machine and not a completely separate play-style.\nThe cybernetic and magic themes are not there to provoke deep thought, they\u2019re just there for flavor and to justify giving you more abilities that you then use in combat.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough \u201cgameplay\u201d for you by itself then you\u2019re probably going to hate the game or have to make some adjustments to get the game to do what you want, because that\u2019s what the \u201cgameplay\u201d is.\nThis game was made by and for people who genuinely find this sort of play to be satisfying.\n\nThe confusing plot that people like to speculate about is mostly icing on the cake and excuse to have the sorts of weird locations and maps the game has. It has a story of course and it does have a lot of interesting bits to it, but again it\u2019s mostly there to justify sending the player to odd places. Everything else is mostly \u201cRule Of Cool\u201d.\nThe game has magical space werewolves, space stoner hippies, and a king of the dead who kills you if you want to join his army for pete\u2019s sake, that should be a clue in that while the plot and setting have some serious elements, overall this isn\u2019t a super-serious plot or setting.\n\nAnyway, there\u2019s my explanation of E.Y.E..\nInterpret that how you will."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506625739, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509746", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "35269305", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198026287398", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1505366578, "num_games_owned": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 723}, "timestamp_updated": 1506625739, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have no brouzouf but my legs are ok."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506820852, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35359703", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198036511359", "num_reviews": 52, "last_played": 1506847076, "num_games_owned": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 316, "playtime_forever": 1104}, "timestamp_updated": 1506820852, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is a game where you become Samurai Jack.
