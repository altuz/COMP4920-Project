This title takes place just over a hundred years into the future after a devastating asteroid impact nearly destroys all life on the planet. But as always, life finds a way as the remnants of what's left of humanity desperately struggle to rebuild and survive after suffering through this exinction level event. You are former U.S. Marine Nicholas Raine who emerges from slumber after being placed in stasis in an underground shelter ironically known as an \"Ark\". After quickly having your life saved from vicious bandits by the leader of a local settlement your fantastic adventure into the unknown begins. You'll step into a world that is completely different from the one that you once knew...a place filled with brutal devastation and heart rending beauty as well as untold dangers and unexpected kindness. Can you survive?\n\nGameplay-wise, RAGE is a superb first person shooter with an emphasis on exploration and there's even a small element of an R.P.G. added in the form of some light crafting. The game is tagged as \"open world\" but you soon quickly realize in the mission areas the rails placed on you guiding you to specific locations. It's nothing that you haven't seen before, various \"well placed\" crates and equipment blocking otherwise accessible exits, locked doors, destroyed entranceways etc.. Luckily, there is a wide variety of weapons and ammunition types available so you will probably find one or two that you can tailor to your particular style of play such as stealth with a sniper rifle or crossbow or just guns blazing with an assault rifle, shotgun or pistol. The combat is frenetic, intense and just alot of fun and the enemy A.I. is very adequate in opposition. They will dodge attacks, take cover, flank and manuever as they advance on you so staying in one place can mean certain death. The car combat and racing is just as entertaining and you even have the oppurtunity to modify your vehicle of choice to your particular tastes as far as performance and aesthetics go. The overall car combat really gives you that \"Mad Max\" feel, the original movie version not the recent game or newer film because those didn't come out until years after RAGE...but they still apply as well. Alongside all those gameplay features there are many activities and diversions in RAGE, of particular note, is a very fun card game that you can play by purchasing and collecting various cards as you explore the wasteland. It's not on par with \"The Witcher III's\" \"Gwent\" but I found it thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. With all the positive gameplay I have to mention four features of the game that I found annoying and one is the four to five second pause that occurs everytime you quicksave. It's a very minor quibble but for someone like me who is constantly saving their game it can be EXTREMELY immersion breaking especially when you're really into the action at the moment. Another thing that gets my goat is the first person melee attack which is horrible. You and a enemy will be standing toe to toe, you'll try to gun butt them and miss while they in turn are slapping you silly. Like the \"save-pause\" this is also insanely frustrating. Also, expect to revisit the same locales more than once as many sidequests can send you to the same location that a main quest took place in just prior. One last thing that I've noticed is that if you fire a shot and knock an opponent down then fire another shot as they are rolling over or trying to stand back up...that shot will not register even if you hit them. Any shot will not connect until after they have completed the animations to roll over or get up so you're just wasting ammo if you try to shoot them during this highly vulnerable time I'm sorry to say. In conclusion, the engaging story, terrific exploration, challenging combat and wide array of weaponry combine for an absolutely wonderful post-apocalyptic gameplay experience despite a few minor flaws.\n\nVisually, I was extremely impressed with this title given that it came out in 2011 as it still looks fantastic to this day. Powered by id Tech\u00ae 5 technology, the lighting and textures in game are just phenomenal, however, a great many of the textures can look not so great if you get a tad too close. With that said, even though civilization has been left in total ruin that does not mean there is a shortage of gorgeous sights to see. The beautiful vistas overlooking the wasteland and charming shanty towns are but a few of the many visually enchanting places to peruse in this game. And as pleasant as the graphics are in RAGE, in my opinion, they take a total backseat to the outstanding animation. The game runs at 60 frames per second and it just looks so spectacular doing so. From the dynamic combat to the intense racing and the exceptional animation on the N.P.C.'s, everything is just so fast and fluid. For example, the people that you interact with in dialogue or see just walking around various settlements are extremely life like in their movements and so pronounced in their mannerisms. Yet another nice detail is the huge amount of variation in the garb that they wear. From a simple settler, wasteland scavenger, horrible mutant to a heavily armored guard, the outfits/armor and accessories from prosthetic limbs to implants that each N.P.C. has is just a pleasure to behold. You'll be hard pressed to find cookie cutter characters, other than the enemies, in this title it really is quite impressive in that aspect and adds yet another layer of immersion to this already fantastic game. The audio quality is also very well done from the terrific soundtrack to the highly believable sound effects. I just love hearing the shells drop to the ground with a clinking noise as I fire my sniper rifle and eject the spent casings...so awesome! To summarize, the striking graphics and high fidelity aurals truly complement the intense action and intriguing storyline of RAGE.\n\nI for one love post-apocalyptic games and RAGE has quickly gone to the top tier of my list of favorite titles in that incredible genre. I wholeheartedly enjoyed this game from the beginning to the end as it does a wonderful job of immersing you in a wasteland environment filled with believably terrifying, thoroughly unlikeable, lovable and quirky characters. The fast paced first person shooter combat, exploration and intense car combat are entertaining enough to definitely warrant additional playthroughs so the replayability of this title is quite high in my opinion. The game also offers an ample amount of options as there are three modes of play in the form of a rich single player campaign, exclusive co-op and online car combat. There is also D.L.C. in the form of an add-on pack called \"RAGE: The Scorchers\". Sadly there are no Steam Trading Cards but there are an abundance of Steam Achievements to be hunted down. In conclusion, RAGE is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to first person shooter, post-apocalyptic and open world gamers looking to go on a great adventure with addictive combat."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505408217, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530005", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34952599", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198075680859", "num_reviews": 168, "last_played": 1505076481, "num_games_owned": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 452}, "timestamp_updated": 1505408217, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Rage\n\nI put off playing this game for many years and simply forgot about its existence until a steam sale.\n\nI was stupid not to play this game earlier\n\nThoroughly enjoyed the weapons in the game and ammo choices.\nConstantly running out of ammo is not so much fun lol\n\nReally felt like a Borderlands or Fallout game.\n\nThe game engine runs incredibly smooth didn't experience any NPC glitches as of yet.\n\nHave not played many games that while sniping from a ridiculous distance the enemies were hitting me.\n\nOverall a fun repetitive quest shooter with upgrades and driving and a fat man that host a gameshow that is fused to a toilet?\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506475867, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532852", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35233408", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198085689125", "num_reviews": 79, "last_played": 1506473280, "num_games_owned": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 151, "playtime_forever": 1235}, "timestamp_updated": 1506713773, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This review is of the single-player campaign.\nRage is what we would get if Fallout 3 and Quake got together and had a kid, with Borderlands as the mid-wife. Excellent shooting mechanics, decent story and fantastic level design set in a debris-filled post-apocalyptic wasteland littered with bandits. What seems an \u201copen world,\u201d though, is really a set of corridors connecting the various hubs, enemies are endlessly reused, and pointless crafting slows the otherwise swift, deft gameplay. Recommended at a discount of 50% off (for the game + DLC) or more.\nTotal size on my hard-drve: 23.8 GB\n\n++ Level design. The Dead City, the Distillery, Jackal Canyon\u2026 Simply great all round.\n\n+ Excellent characters. They\u2019re never explored in depth, but everyone is unique, with few re-used voice actors.\n+ Great selection of weapons. A variety of specialty ammo was a nice touch.\n+ Good driving mechanics.\n+ Great atmosphere. Walk into a bar in Wellsprings and there are people chatting, a jukebox is playing in the corner, yellowish light filters through the dirty windows, and a dusty haze hangs in the air.\n+ Excellent soundtrack.\n+ Excellent voice-acting.\n+ Excellent facial animations and body language (especially for its age). Not normally something I\u2019d notice, but I played Rage right after playing Mass Effect Andromeda. What a breath of fresh air Rage proved to be.\n+ Well-optimized on PC. Plays at a silky-smooth 60fps on my Radeon RX 470.\n\n+/- Story works, but is hardly special. Our hero was locked in cryostasis when a threat to Earth materialized. The threat happened, we wake and enter the \u201cnew\u201d world. We join a Resistance movement, fight bandits and Authority. Fairly standard stuff. Sequel-bait ending right as things are getting interesting. Rage is six years old. At the time of writing, there is no sequel in sight.\n+/- Fun mini-games, but there aren\u2019t enough of them, and they\u2019re repeated in each city hub with no variation.\n+/- The textures. Up close, they\u2019re awful, some of the worst I\u2019ve seen. Stand a back a bit, and they look amazing. Forcing 8k textures via a config file helps, but doesn\u2019t solve the issue. Landscapes and vistas look impressive, but wall switches don\u2019t.\n+/- Racing seems shoe-horned into Rage. It\u2019s a welcome change of pace, but it seems like it would be a waste of resources in a post-apocalyptical wasteland.\n+/- No day / night cycle while you\u2019re out in the wasteland.\n+/- Almost all the women are hawt. It took an asteroid slamming into earth to turn almost every woman you meet into a model. But hey, I\u2019m not complaining. Though it does feel a bit weird to rescue this one (hot) woman from bandits (who had tied her up in a very suggestive position); she then takes up residence in your trophy room as... one of your trophies?! Wtf.\n\n- Frame-rate is capped at 60. Unlocking it will require a mod (called \u201cid5 Tweaker.\u201d)\n- Level paths might be well-designed, but too often they feel tight and narrow.\n- There\u2019s no point to crafting except to pad the gameplay. Why not stumble across grenades? You do a few times, but more often you\u2019ll be looking for the four components needed to craft grenades.\n- There are a few bosses, but no final boss \u2013 surprising in an Id game.\n- Enemy AI is extremely predictable. Soldiers tend to stick behind cover; mutants will charge your position relentlessly. Once you know who you\u2019re facing, combat rarely surprises.\n- Aside from your initial dune buggy, no customization options for your vehicles. \n- Not many enemies. Mutants, Authority, and bandits. That\u2019s it.\n- Not a true open world. Hubs connected by corridors that you will traverse repeatedly, fighting the same re-spawning bandits over and over. Most buildings require a loading screen.\n- Fetch-quest missions. Most of the side-content is fetch-quest filler that frequently involves...\n- Re-used levels. Expect to play some levels twice. The second time is sometimes in reverse of the first time. \n- Awful mouse acceleration. There is a Mouse Sensitivity slider in the options that helps (there is partial controller support).\n- Alt-tabbing out of the game disables v-sync. After you alt-tab back into Rage, you\u2019ll have to visit the options menu to turn it back on.\n\nRage turns out to be a mixed bag of good and not-so-good in nearly equal measure. It\u2019s definitely possible to have some fun with it in a shoot-y sort of way, but it\u2019s an \u201cover fast, on to the next game\u201d experience instead of wanting to immediately return to the world for another playthrough. I\u2019d love to see a sequel \u2013 the world building is first-rate \u2013 but I hope we see more than a thin plot used as an excuse to shoot things in obviously re-used levels. There is real potential in the Rage franchise."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506400448, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508039", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35215682", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198061491357", "num_reviews": 37, "last_played": 1506485253, "num_games_owned": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "playtime_forever": 81}, "timestamp_updated": 1506400448, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm surprised i haven't bought this game before it's really fucking good for being a 2011 game reminds me of a mix of borderlands and fallout but maybe more of borderlands.

Poor story (but much far elaborated than any previously done by the studio), nice looking graphics at least from far distances and solid FPS gameplay, simply said the shooting is awesome, some missions are much better than another but in general is a great shooter.\n\nId Software began the developing of Rage in the most darkest times for PC gaming when piracy, changes in retail channels and beginning of internet gaming stores plumped down PC retail sales.  Those dark times when XBOX and Playstation began to drain all PC exclusive franchises (COD 2, BF Bad Company 1, Medal of Honor and a long list) that studios/publishers skipped the PC. \n\nThen Id Software took a decision to focus Id Tech 5 in optimize developing times between ports. This is the interesting part because Id Tech 5 engine games (Rage, Wolf New Order, Wolf Old blood, Evil Within)  look awesome from far distances and like crap when getting closer.

It says I spent 16 hours on it. I completed all of the side missions. Except for half of the races, but the races only last a couple minutes anyway. So I would think (assuming I won the race) that it would only add maybe 10 or so minutes to my playtime. That's considering I had 3 or something races left over. \n\nIt's a good game though I recommend it. I had it in my steam library for a while and initially passed on it because it looked kind of bland when I first had heard of it. So yeah I recommend. That's the short review. I'll add a bit more if you're interested.\n\nSo about it being very similar to games you've probably played. LIke Borderlands/Fallout kind of post apocalyptic. I feel like this was \"Id\" expressing their \"ego\" (that's a joke kids). I get the feeling they made it similar to those other games because they wanted to one up them. They don't really do that though. The open world is a lot smaller than you think it is. A lot of the missions make you replay a dungeon that you beat, but in reverse. Like the first mission you do, you enter through the front door; then the 2nd mission you play it again but through the back door. Considering that it goes on sale a lot and I think I got it in a bundle or something. I can't remember when I bought it but I know I got it cheap because it's on my account. It has a lot of flaws. Even full price at 10 bucks it's probably worth it to be honest. There are a lot of flaws though. You don't even get the \"BFG\" weapon till the final mission and there isn't a boss to use it on. It's kind of wasted to be honest. I didn't actually fire it because I was conserving ammo thinking there would be a boss or something. The final \"boss\", is actually just a bunch of the cannon mutants that they sent after you in waves while you hit switches. It's something people usually put in the middle of a level. Not the final challenge. Also there is no ending. There is one but it's not an ending. (spoilers or what ever) The ending is a satilite turning on. Woo hoo... I guess. \n\nOk enough complaining, I'll list the things I like and why you would probably like it. So it's got good gunplay, but enemies are a bit bullet spongey but that's usually remedied by the secondary ammo or just using a better gun. There is more than enough money to just focus on getting the better ammo anyway. I didn't know that though and ended up hording my money and swapping guns to try and conserve ammo and such. It's fun though, the racing missions are entertaining. There is a cool variety in certain missions. It has a good cast of characters, and for the most part you care a little bit about the people you are helping. The facial animations are really good. Like in comparison to a lot of games, people look like people. Almost too much maybe, like I swear I've seen some of the characters in real life. There is a merchant in the first area that looks like a dudes uncle I once new. Even has the same mannerisms. \n\nIt's short, sweet, and fun. I'm not sure I'd play again, but I'm not unhappy with my purchase and that's what counts."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505433182, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417492", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34960134", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": "3", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013462546", "num_reviews": 99, "last_played": 1506436690, "num_games_owned": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 512, "playtime_forever": 2428}, "timestamp_updated": 1505434216, "received_for_free": false, "review": "THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES MADE EVER:\n\nThis game works because it a good company and they know how to make games hope they make another game.
