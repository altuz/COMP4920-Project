Hydrophobia would be a pioneer in what we call Early Release Alpha/Access where you pay for an incomplete game at full retail(or whatever is regarded as full price for said game) price; and in return, the developers use the funds to complete the game or as the lingo back then called it, give constant updates based on player feedback. For Hydrophobia, 360 users were stuck at the alpha level while the pc users got the reward in the form of Hydrophobia Prophecy. I played and completed the 360 verision years ago and was happy when this game showed up during a sale. First off, no matter what resolution you set this game to, it will full screen, forcing you to modify the start up settings. The first original half is unchanged besides better graphics but the issues come with the second half of the game when you get your super powers. Controls are wonky and it is not long after you get them, that you are given an boss fight that requires some mastery over them. Oh, I hope you didn't use up the energy rounds during normal gameplay because the fight requires you to attack with that first, then pick up an explosive and throw it at what can be described as Glados's grandfather. And once you accomplish this(a cut scene will trigger), the boss controling it will send out minions who even with other ammo types, have high def unless you want to charge up the sonic and get hit while so because you are getting shot at places that make cover useless. Oh, if you hide behind cover for too long, then the main baddie will bomb your local area. Soon, you are facing the boss and his minions at the same time. Woot! No. Then to add icing to this shit cake, the game crashes.\n\nMeh, first half; lolno, second half. Avoid and go play a more balanced game with a difficulty spike like Dark Souls."}]}
