[/u]\n\nHitogata Happa is a game that is completely different from the other Gundemonium games, opting for the traditional top down view and focusing itself as a prequel. But is this a suicidal concept?\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\n\nHitogata Happa, for whatever reason, plays very differently from the other Gundemonium titles. Using the more widely used top down view, Hitogata Happa's main gimmick is in its name. Roughly translating to \"humanoid explosion,\" Hitogata Happa features the ability to crash your playable character into an enemy to create a powerful explosion that is almost necessary for completing the game. To offset this questionable sacrifice, your playable characters are an army of non-sentient dolls created by your BFF and partner in revolution, Kreutzer. Your dolls are 100% expendable, and you get more after finishing each campaign mission, so you can stockpile. In addition to having lots of them, you also have a variety of dolls to choose from, with all of them doing different things. You'll, of course, need all of this because this game is hard. Like, really hard. Harder then the other Gundemoniums, at the least. Bosses have time limits, enemies are quick to the draw and cover the screen with bullets very fast, even on normal difficulty, and things go downhill really quick unless you're good at dodging or erasing bullets (You can do that!). \n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\n\nProbably the most \"updated\" graphics of any Gundemonium game besides Recollection, Hitogata Happa looks alright, but definitely loses a bit due to the same color palette being used on every enemy (This is mostly done as the enemy faction, the Genoremasody Reich, are suppose to look similar and very factorialized, justifying the color palette). The game also has a bit of color loss, mostly due to the game's darker approach in story. It does make up for these lackluster colors with its intriquite weavings and patterns that you see all over the game, from the marking on the AoE of your suicide bomb attack, to the text on the mission complete screen.\n\n[u] Performance [/u]\n\nNothing particularly bad. Good ol' Potato friendly gaming.\n\n[u] Soundtrack [/u]\n\nAs per the Hitogata Happa way, the Soundtrack is a bit more different, going for a more elegant approach with tons of organ, piano, and fiddle/violin abuse. It's good, but not what you're used to if you've listened to the other two soundtracks. Still, it's kickass in it's own way, especially the true-final-boss track. Really good stuff from Woofles, who takes DM Ashura's place in the soundtrack department this time. \n\n[u] Recollection [/u]\n\nGood game.

Playing this blind is odious and how you need to play it is not as obvious as most other shmups.\nThe thing about having to crash against the bosses to kill them is interesting, but just as you would think, is very annoying to pull off since if you get hit by a bullet it negates the explosion and that's what's most likely to happen as you near the boss you're trying to attack.\nThe thing about the game entering sudden death mode when the timer runs out on the bosses, sure, it enforces the suicide bomb playstyle expected from the game, but will be an immediate turn down for anyone who, like me, came expecting a traditional shmup and didn't look for the manual. So, hopefully, you'll read the fucking game up. It still makes boss fights really annoying if you take too long to beat them, which is more likely than not since you'll spend most of your time running into bullets while trying to suicide into the boss. Hopefully this problem is solved once you give yourself enough practice and time to learn the game, I did not give myself that many.\nOne thing I remember from this game is that there were a couple patterns on fucking easy that did not fucking belong on easy.\nOne thing that bothered me a lot is that once you die, you get a short time to select a new character to send out, which you can select with the arrow keys. DON'T. Just fucking DON'T. If I want to select a new character before spawning, at least let it be only with the actual character selection keys.

Suddenly, I remembered it all.  If you're wondering why my \"time spent\" on this game here on Steam is so low, and yet I'm writing a review, it's because I've already spent a big pile of time with this, and the other two games, on the PS3 versions, which came out quite some time ago.  \n\nThe other two games in the trilogy are bloody brilliant.  Excellent bullet-hell type games.\n\nThis one though is different.  Everything that the other two get right, THIS one gets wrong.  Uninteresting attack patterns, extremely repetetive (and short) level design, stupid control issues (really?  There's no \"slow movement\" button here?  In a bullet-hell shmup? when there WAS one in the other two?), cheap boss attacks (the first boss: If you DONT know that he's going to do the arm swipe as his first attack, and if you dont ALREADY know just where to be when he does it, you WILL die 1 second into the fight.  Gets worse from there.) and one of the worst game mechanics I've ever heard of in this type of game.\n\nSee, here's the main gimmick:  You've got all of these different dolls that you control instead of ships.  You can switch them out when one dies, and you essentially get nine lives to go with.  All of them have different abilities and blah blah blah.  None of THAT matters, though, you see.  While that all sounds cool, it's obliterated by that particular gameplay mechanic that I mentioned up above.  You cant just shoot things in this or use special powers on them, nooooooooooo.   What you have to do is kill yourself.  No, really.  Bosses in particular CANNOT be beaten without doing this.... numerous times on each.  You fill up this \"flow\" meter by shooting stuff, and when it's powered up, ramming yourself into an enemy of any sort will cause the doll to violently explode, doing massive damage to anything caught in the blast.  \n\nBosses take next to no damage from anything else, so you A: have to do this against them, and B: have to have enough remaining lives when you reach each one.\n\nBut the problem with this is simple:  This is a danmaku shmup.   Bullet-hell.  Where the idea of RAMMING something exists.  Think about that for a second.  You've got chaotic, and most importantly, DENSE patterns coming out from these things, and you have to RAM THE SOURCE OF THEM.  In other words, you must successfully plow directly through the areas with the highest bullet density (since it's where the shots are coming from) and successfully ram the boss without taking a hit.  Yeah.  Good luck with that one. \n\nTypically, getting really close to enemies... and I dont mean right next to them, but just a short distance away... in a bullet-hell game is quite the challenge for most players.  There are plenty of games of this type where the closer you are to an enemy when it pops, the more points you get.  Which makes sense due to the challenge of getting close without taking a hit.  But that's an OPTIONAL thing.... you dont HAVE to do it.  And you can learn it in bits and pieces.  As you go through the game in question, you'll learn the patterns and learn how everything works, and you spot different ways of getting close to some things to pop them, and so on.  \n\nWell, in THIS game, you *have* to do it, and getting close isnt good enough.  Gotta actually collide with the thing.  AFTER surviving long enough to charge up the Flow meter. \n\nYeah.  Saying that this is frustrating is an understatement.  \n\n\nThis developer has made a number of interesting and creative shmuppy games, and for the most part all of them are very good, which of course includes Gundemonium Recollection and GundeadliGne, the other two in this 3-pack.  But THIS game is the exception.  And I haaaaaaaate having to say that, as this is one of those developers that I have alot of respect for otherwise.  \n\nBut even a great dev can make a mistake from time to time."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1463359007, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "23011756", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198041017157", "num_reviews": 49, "last_played": 1465348068, "num_games_owned": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1342}, "timestamp_updated": 1463368893, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A very fun bullet-hell shooter.\n\nThe main gimmick, for the genre, is that you can choose between 8 types of dolls, each with heavily varying abilities, and none ever come out as useless.
