The low budget does show sometimes (copy paste environments, and typos in the subtitles), but it also does many things right. There are some interesting gameplay mechanics and it does a very good job of changing the pace up. Sound design (especially explosions) is solid, and the gunplay is also quite good.\n\nI also had some graphical problems at the beginning, with my framerate jumping between 30 and 60 (and this on a 4790K and GTX 970), but after some tweaking in nVidia's Control Panel, it sat at 60 all the way through. This was on Windows 10 Pro x64.\n\nDefinitely worth a buy on sale."}, {"votes_down": 9, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1451645753, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519379", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "20175381", "votes_up": 19, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198010367135", "num_reviews": 69, "last_played": 1451644892, "num_games_owned": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 242}, "timestamp_updated": 1461547800, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops is your typical first-person modern shooter game. The gist of the game is you work for the United States Army and you have your enemies that are fringe organisations. You, the player, play as both Cpt. Myra Lee and Cpt. Aron Alvarez and switch between them in the later stages of the game, but mainly switch between both in solo missions.\n\nWell let's get straight to it. The game isn't very good. This game isn't an AAA game, but not being AAA does not mean you can't have good games. It does have its positives in a above-average storyline that covers a wide variety of settings. I will admit that due to how bad the game is performence and gameplay-wise, I did not finish the campaign. However, I finished about four hours of the campaign, with How Long To Beat.com noting the length of the campaign is seven hours. Again, the campaign isn't that bad. I will note that I had not played this game in many months and coming back to this game, I remembered why I never finished this.\n\nThe main issue is the UI and graphics, performance and the gameplay. To begin, I don't find the gameplay to be appealing. The default control layout is odd to a normal typical first person shooter, but regardless I don't like how the mechanics work. The mechanics include running into cover to go into the cover system, which is annoying, the AI is odd, and the choice of weapons in the game is poor. Also, the graphics are bad for a 2011 game. The performence is very poor. With my specs listed on my profile, I can't get a stable 60FPS with max settings on this game, which is appalling. So mainly, the graphics, performance and gameplay was a major turn-off for I. The game has its fair share of glitches too.\n\nOverall, I'll be blunt, I do not recommend this game. The gameplay is poor, the graphics are bad, the game is unoptimised, but the story is above-average. If you do wish to get the game, get it at a very steep discount, otherwise do not bother as their are other great games worth your time. 2/10\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops is one of those games I put off buying because it was hard to find anything positive about it. To me a 34 metascore means this game is absolutely atrocious, something that isn't even ready for public release. I have to testify that isn't the case. That's not to say the game doesn't have faults. I have yet to find a game that doesn't have faults--ok maybe Call of Duty 4. But I've played some pretty bad games in my time and this one comes nowhere close to rock bottom.\n\nIt's a traditional cover shooter, but you get to play two different characters, similar to Conflict: Denied Ops. There's a run and gun rambo character and a sneaky, stealth character. Both have their uses in each mission, but the stealth character is by far the more fun of the two for gameplay. Her crossbow works very well and was enjoyable taking out unsuspecting AI from distance. Now there are a couple areas where the run and gun guy gets to control a battle mech which was pretty fun as well (kind of FEAR 2 style). Overall I liked the shooter elements and thought they were good.\n\nThe story is okay, but feels like it should have been longer--almost like they just had to get the product out the door and kind of wrapped up all the loose ends in a nice bow rather than finishing it properly.\n\nMany of the negatives don't even have anything to do with the gameplay. Stuff like separate volume controls for voices, background, and music don't exist. And you can't turn the music off. This makes it hard to hear voice dialog during some of the missions. The graphics and graphic controls are also bad--lots of tearing and jagged edges. There is a bloom option and when it's on, there's too much bloom where a lot of scenes are just a white blur, but when it's off, the environment is so dark, it's hard to see. The framerate gets pretty bad when a lot of things are blowing up simultaneously as well. \n\nThe cover system is decent, but annoying. It's automatic and you often end up in cover when you don't want to be. The voice acting is obviously not top quality, but doesn't stand out as being bad.\n\nAll in all, most of the elements of Shadow Harvest: Phantom Ops are average or below average. I had fun with it and would recommend it as a bargain bin shooter. It's right in line with bargain bin material like Sniper: Ghost Warrior. I'm glad I looked past the bad publicity and gave it a shot."}, {"votes_down": 13, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1391520112, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509074", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8972719", "votes_up": 20, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197974105367", "num_reviews": 133, "last_played": 1439902222, "num_games_owned": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1157}, "timestamp_updated": 1391520112, "received_for_free": false, "review": "People bash this game unnecessarily.  \nYes, it\u2019s far from perfect and has some issues but it dint destroy me having fun with it.
