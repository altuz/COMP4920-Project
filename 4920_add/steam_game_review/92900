But I was very wrong. \nHowever, the game is actually a pretty good looking game for something that came out a few years ago. But it's not for everyone, the effects can really bother some people, luckily there are options to turn them off if you don't quite like some of the shaders being used.\nIt would be nice if this game had co-op but unfortunately that is not the case for this game or Agricultural Simulator 2013 either.\nSo if you had to play a farming simulator game, I'd recommend FS13 demo instead due to that being a free trial to see if you like it and if you do, get that instead.

According to My Own Rating.\n\nA farming simulator that has better (although laggy) graphics and livestock breeding but is harder to get started, doesn't allow modding and is filled with bugs (couldn't expect any better from the creators of skyscraper simulator).\n\nGot 2 points for the graphics and 1 for the livestock breeding. Even though it's not really fun, the livestock it's much more diverse than the Farming simulator's one so... at least they tried something. Everything else is way worse than Farming simulator.\n\nInterface lag.\nNo modding.\nBugs. Lots of them. Some will make the game crash.\nVERY Stupid AI.\nHard to get started (took me a while to figure out the game had already started). \nNo tutorial. \nNot so intuitive controls. \nNo real brands for machinery (not like I really care though). \nEverything is too damn slow. It may take SEVERAL HOURS to complete a farming cycle (assuming you use the time skip feature to speed up crops' growth. Otherwise it would take days). \nPrices are not balanced and can't be fixed since there's no modding.\n\nYou can go for livestock breeding and make a billion dollars faster than a single crop  cycle (which is worth about 20k).  Although you'll probably get bored and quit before that. \n\nNot worth buying unless it is included in a bundle you're already buying. Don't expect any better from the 2013 version. If you get the demo you'll see the interface lagging got even worse.\n\nBuy Farming Simulator instead."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1419446194, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496663", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "13573322", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198031545484", "num_reviews": 54, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 28}, "timestamp_updated": 1441562464, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Worst Simulator I bought ever. \n\nIn short:\nDon\u00b4t even know what to do when, let alone how to farm in this particular game.\n\nRecommend?\nNo."}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1396749690, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501504", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9739762", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198067110005", "num_reviews": 7, "last_played": 1396743669, "num_games_owned": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 24}, "timestamp_updated": 1396749690, "received_for_free": false, "review": "10/10 really nails the life of being a farmer.
