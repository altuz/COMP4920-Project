However, it's clealry tagged as a TD, and is viewed & reviewed as such, so my own review will remain the same since I bought is as a TD. Maybe if you're looking for a quirky strategy game, this could be for you... anyways:\n\nThis is such a bad TD game that my biggest regret is I can't permanently delete this abomination from my library without deleting other actually good games because I got it in a Steam bundle many moons ago.\n\nIt's SO bad, that I'm actually thinking about deleting the whole bundle and re-buying the others just so I can never look at it again. Yeah, that bad.\n\nIt does have a couple of good things I guess, the visual style is, or at least was, intriguing when it came out (now there's a ton of dime-a-dozen \"retro\" pixel art games everywhere), and it kinda looks like an interesting game...\n\nHowever, it's not. It's a VERY subpar TD, with shody mechanics, and beffudling upgrade system and don't even get me started into the whole \"difficulty being tied to the economy\" issue. That's one of the single most stupid game design decisions I've seen in any game, let alone a TD game.\n\nHell, I even tried just cheating to see if it would be enjoyable that way... guess what? Nope, it was still a frickin' drag to play, so as an avid TD afficionado, I'd say: Stay away from this game."}]}
