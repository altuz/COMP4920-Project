It's not a simple \"build a lot of grunts and win by having a larger army\", because enemy defenses will crush you. When attacking you need to think what units to use. At the very beginning of the game the resource system might look weak, but when you get shields systems, long area radar, artillery, tactical missiles and more, you will find yourself micromanaging your resources - which is a good thing for a RTS game. The worst part, however, is the story - a big let down if you like to play a game which story gives you motivation to finish the game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1126788632 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1129180933"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505559717, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499280", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34993921", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198076752553", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1506738591, "num_games_owned": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 675, "playtime_forever": 2446}, "timestamp_updated": 1505559717, "received_for_free": false, "review": "If you havent played this then you're childhood was waisted. 99/100 there are alot of lag isues but still amazing regardless"}, {"votes_down": 8, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505570281, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488435", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34997700", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198047123318", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505570139, "num_games_owned": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 31}, "timestamp_updated": 1505570281, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is insainly BUGGY!
