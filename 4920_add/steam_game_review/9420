If you ever played an RTS and felt like it was a bit small, Supreme Commander is the answer to your unasked question.\n\nThe game plays out on absolutely giant maps, with distances that take average units ages to walk across, requiring you to build transports to move them at an even slightly acceptable speed. It allows for actual artillery to be laid down and strike your enemies from afar, sending a hailstorm of screeching shells into your enemy's frontline or even their home base. It allows for nuclear strikes that can wipe out entire fields of units if you're not prepared for it. There is so much feeling packed into Supreme Commander of being an almighty God that you cannot help but go a bit mad playing the game.\n\nThat's not to say Supreme Commander isn't balanced; quite the contrary. There are four factions, each with definite strengths and weaknesses, none of them so great that they cannot fight the others, but require different tactics and approaches. You can play the UEF, the remnants of a federation of humanity, trying desperately to restore order in a galaxy of chaos, brought about largely by themselves. Signing on with them nets you a straightforward fight, with classic artillery, tanks and choppers. Or you can play as the guerilla cybernetic freedom fighters, the Cybran, who seek to bring justice to all those melded with machinery from the tyranny of UEF. The Cybran are decidely more versatile, often equipped with cloaking devices, EMP strikes and amphibious vehicles, which give them an easier time doing many different things, as the situations change, but not quite the same headstrong charge of the UEF. If you play the long game, you can take your chances with the Aeon, an almost religious group, using long-dead alien technology to bring their fanaticism to the rest of the galaxy. Your units tend to be more maneuverable, hit harder and have slightly longer range, but with slow firing rates and a general inflexibility; each unit does one job only. As the story mode unfolds, you can play with any faction, advancing their campaign to an eventual endgame to decide the fate of the galaxy, whether it be in the hands of a shattered UEF, the fledgling Cybran or the mysterious Aeon.\n\nIn Forged Alliance, a whole new faction is brought to bear; the Seraphim. An alien race, believed extinct and vanished, returns in the aftermath of the first game, bringing with them a hellfire that fractures what's left of all three factions of the first game. Only by uniting together will they be able to defeat this threat. But the strain of these alliegences threatens their goal and the game opens with the entirity of the humanity on its last legs, trying to stem the tide of the Seraphim. Playing as the Seraphim offers a unique sensation. They combine many elements from each of the three factions, while remaining very distinct from the others, not merely in aesthetics, but also in their unit options.\n\nAnd still, I need to speak more about playing the game itself. Every game begins with a Supreme Commander; a builder, elite soldier, gatherer of resources and military overlord all in one. These commanders represent your player and if they are eliminated, traditionally, you are too and the game is over for you. Even if you allow for the deaths of commanders without ending the game, it can often lead to it indirectly; the explosion left behind is massive.\n\nThere are two resources, energy and mass. Mass is only found in specific locations, while energy can be harvested from anywhere, but the buildings for doing so represent huge targets for your opponent and a loss of energy, even temporarily, can often knock out many of your elite units' special abilities, costing you more than you might realize. The struggle for more mass extractors promotes territorial conflicts as players scramble to collect as many as they can, build defenses and station soldiers there.\n\nOnce the resources pour in, you lay down a few factories, either to make air units, land units or sea units; each with distinct features and systems, but none of them isolated: land units are quite capable of downing aircraft, aircraft can bomb land and sea and a vessel close enough to the land will often obliterate nearly any land unit that gets too close. And when you've got enough units around you and a few engineers out from them, you upgrade your factories and start producing newer and often better units.\n\nAn interesting facet of Supreme Commander is that even late in the game, older units never become completely obsolete; they are always generated faster, cost less and often 50 tier 1 units can outmatch the equivalent cost of tier 3 units. In this way, keeping tier 1 factories around is rewarded, rather than punished and it promotes a genuine question as to when to upgrade, rather than just as soon as possible.\n\nBut when it comes time to end the game, Supreme Commander is a spectacular show of so-called \"Experimental Units\" which can only be built by engineers from tier 3 factories and often at absurdly high costs. But if you can afford it, you will not regret it; experimental units are designed to end games that would otherwise continue indefinitely and they are often highly succesful.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into all the complex features of radar, cloaking, stealth systems, reclaiming, neutral camps, terrain, air fighters, submarines, tactical strikes, ground defenses, shields, mass generators, upgrades for your Commander, support commanders and so much more. In terms of features, Supreme Commander cannot possibly be said to disappoint. They never become overwhelming; so many of them simply make the game a joy to play. Queing actions has never been easier and more visual than in Supreme Commander, nor has transporting large swathes of units across the map or setting patrol routes.\n\nBesides this, the game is highly innovative in its ideas, forgoing a minimap in favor of simply being able to zoom out so far that the main screen becomes a minimap, letting aerial units actually go off the map if required to by their maneuvors, aircraft carriers, submersible aircraft carriers. And if you were to zoom in, you will find that despite the game's age, it is quite a detailed and carefully crafted game, visually speaking (though it does tend to cost your performance some when too many units begin to gather onscreen, which, given the absurdly high limits for how many units can be on the field, is quite often possible). Not to mention a very good, if not always very memorable, soundtrack and sounds that instantly convey their meaning.\n\nIf you like RTS games at all, this is one you simply have to try."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505789941, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35056879", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198362841065", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1507159536, "num_games_owned": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 319, "playtime_forever": 6795}, "timestamp_updated": 1505789941, "received_for_free": false, "review": "very adictive game. i play it at least once a day"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505056113, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34864154", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198276184325", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505667085, "num_games_owned": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 4701}, "timestamp_updated": 1505056113, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Best strategy game ever\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504569680, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34746456", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972061840", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1506656543, "num_games_owned": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 971, "playtime_forever": 3108}, "timestamp_updated": 1504569680, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game has been entertaining me and my friends for so long.
