This game is also set in the year 1619, but it is not in the New World. It is set in Mars. You are a British colonial on the run from the king and country and you try to uncover the secrets of the colony of Roanoke. However, the opposing forces you must face are the Spanish/Martians. This is a top-down shooter that would remind shooters fans of top-down shooters from the 1980s.\n\nIt feels like the plot takes a backseat to the solid gameplay. The game introduces you to the beam ship, a standard ship with a primary mode and a secondary mode that requires you to use the left mouse and right mouse, respectively. Other ships are locked until you complete some campaign missions, but you will still have to use the left and right mouse buttons. The controls are that simple, but the game will always test your skills to the max. The beam ship\u2019s primary mode is the 2 lines of bullets and the secondary mode is the powerful beam that can destroy lesser enemies with ease and is very useful against larger enemies. Other ships that are unlocked have their own primary and secondary modes and are good for testing in the campaign missions and challenge stages. The DLCs have more ships that can be unlocked and are definitely worth trying out while testing your skills.\n\nAll ships unlocked in the game have one thing in common: a vaunt meter. You must fill up this vaunt meter by collecting the golden nuts and bolts that defeated enemies drop. Once you activate that vaunt by using your default middle mouse button, there is a circular shield that appears around your ship. At first glance, the vaunt looks like it is useful for defensive strategies and is a life saver. I later realized that the vaunt begins a point multiplier that builds up as you defeat enemies while the vaunt is active.  You can defeat many enemies in a very short time, but the vaunt also lasts for a short time. The vaunt is best activated when you are in a tight situation, such as when many enemies are firing so many bullets it would be hard to get through them without being blown up.\n\nJames town challenges your shooting and movement skills enough that you would have to visit your shoppe to buy some items with the currency you have earned during the campaign missions. The currency comes from collecting the golden nuts and bolts from the defeated enemies. You can buy new ships and challenge packs with your hard earned currency. The challenge stages are break from the campaign missions, but they truly put your skills to the test and train you for other challenge stages and campaign missions.\n\nThe challenge stages require you to reach specific goals such as scoring X number of points in X number of seconds. In one challenge stage you must destroy train cars to score an extraordinary number of points to complete the stage. The trick is to destroy train cars, but destroying the engine car last is the key to scoring so many points. I think this is a smart learning curve put together by the indie developers of this game. The difficulties are not unfair because the game is not over that quickly. Jamestown gives you a few credits from the beginning of the mission or challenge stage and those credits can be enough to win at the end.\n\nAn interesting take on the learning curve of Jamestown is how you unlock future campaign missions. In order to unlock future campaign mission you have to complete each of the other previous missions on the next highest difficulty level. Every campaign mission begins with ordinary enemies and some larger enemies. When you reach the last stage there is a boss to defeat. It is important to lose as few lives as possible in order to defeat the boss since it is easy to lose multiple credits. There are lots of close calls throughout the game and your ship explodes when it is hit in its dead center. The vaunt becomes critical in these close calls, but you have to be sure that the vaunt is available when the situation is right.\n\nJamestown has local co-op of up to four players. It is surprising to me that there is no multiplayer since the game would have made for some interesting competition. There are leaderboards to show you how you stack up against other players from around the world.\n\nThe graphics are pixelated, but the pixelation is very impressive and detailed. All the explosions and action look very nice and you clearly see the well detailed stripes on the uniforms of the enemies who represent the Spanish/Martian forces. \n\nEssentially, the graphics provide enough style and the gameplay of Jamestown provides enough substance to warrant buying this game at an affordable price of $9.99. The opportunities to unlock ships, campaign missions, and challenge stages will motivate you to continue playing so that you can hone your skills enough.\n\nMy Score: 8/10\n\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1435389754, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511838", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "16734762", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197965322630", "num_reviews": 77, "last_played": 1435759342, "num_games_owned": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 154}, "timestamp_updated": 1435389955, "received_for_free": false, "review": "It is 90s' vertical arcade shooter with enhanced features and presentation!\n\nGood:\n- Beautiful 2D pixel drawings, very rare to see in nowadays, about the top notch graphic level of previous NeoGeo games\n- Marvelous Soundtrack, match the story background neatly\n- Great control response and very accurate hit box detection\n- Pretty enemy designs\n- Various modes and challenge adds replayablility\n- Wide screen vertical shooters is eyes friendly\n- Local Coop up to 4 players, I don't complaint the lack of Online mode as I can see it won't goes well with current Internet environment for such tense response game\n\nBad:\n- Scenario stages is quite short, I don't mind to buy DLC to extend the joy\n\nSuggestion:\n- Vault Bulletshield is same for all Ships.

Some real historical characters of the period even are mentioned in the game as the famous John Smith. Jamestown has a very good vertical gameplay, being that the game has four types of ships, each ship has a normal shot and another special. There is also the \"Vaunt Mode\" that can be activated when the gold bar is full. The \"Vaunt Mode\" when activated generates a temporary shield around the ship and also allows double the damage and also the points earned while active. The 2D graphics of this game are well done and the controls work well, but the highest point of the game is the soundtrack ... it's superb!

Normally, most people just hear the words and move away from anything related to the genre. But Jamestown is easily an exception to that instinctive behaviour.\n\nIf you're old enough to remember those games where you had a plane or a ship flying on a vertically-scrolling background and tanks/turrets/monsters/something evil appeared and lobbed a red ball of death towards your vessel, Jamestown doesn't fall very far from that tree. What you need to know is that, much like most of those games, enemies spawn at the exact same place every time you run the exact same level (that is, the level itself associated with a difficulty). Unlike those games, however, you get the chance to select the difficulty.\n\nJamestown is nice enough to players new to the bullet-hell genre by having multiple difficulties. \"How is that nice?\" you're thinking. The easiest difficulty is easy enough for someone that never played any game in his life to learn patterns, which in turn make them develop a sense of where to be and where not to be given the properties of the ship they're using. And each step in the difficulty curve is acceptable at the point where the player can reliably clear a level without dying more than once; it's a proof of skill from the player's part. That said, most people won't be able to clear all levels at the highest difficulty the game offers, and possibly not even the one before that. If you're in it for the \"100%\", you better be prepared to invest a good time of your life here.\n\nBut achievement nuts aside, Jamestown is full of strong points. The controls are responsive as you'd expect a game of the genre, the music is like someone tossed you a thousand dollars and said \"keep it, no strings attached\", the visual style is undoubitably gorgeous. It even has an unusual backstory in a strange futuristic-pastlike-future for a game with no reason to have a story, if you care about those things. It also has a sort of \"challenge mode\" where you try to complete hard tasks in a preset course; think of it as this game's minigames. You have an activatable invulnerability shield on certain conditions as a base game mechanic related to scoring points. You also get to have four different ships to blast the baddies, each very different in gameplay from the others, so you can specialize in one that best suits you or try to master all of them for added replayability. And of course, you have a \"gauntlet mode\" where even reaching its end is like getting a free pat in the back and a bucket of your favourite drink.\n\nIf you're looking for weak points, the only things that come to mind is the extra ships dlc (because you either love them and use them or end up sticking to only one or non-at-all since you already love one of the base game's ships) and the inherent what-you-see-is-what-you-get replayability that's associated with fixed levels and how high the skill barrier is for you. If you're a master of the bullet-hell genre, the hardest difficulty may be less challenging than you'd hope.\n\nAlso, one can not stress this enough: the music of this game is amazing. The soundtrack's extra cost? If you play the game and like it, I recommend you buy it to hear it outside the game; supposedly the money goes to the composer, which needs to eat just like you.\n\nAll in all, Jamestown is a great game. A solid 8 out of 10 easily, maybe even more. If you consider the game a little costy, wait for a discount; if the music is also at a discount, make sure you also buy it if you liked it in-game. As for the dlc ships, hit or miss: if you like the game, and want to say you like the people that put their heart making it, buy; otherwise my opinion is avoid unless at a good discount."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1447095578, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502457", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "18975096", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198018815088", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1493824783, "num_games_owned": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 251}, "timestamp_updated": 1447095578, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Having owned this title a fair few years and spent a small number of hours playing i can honestly say its one of Steams best bullet hell shooters on the market.

The action is easy to pick up and hard to master, knowing when to use defensive/offensive special abilities adds another layer of depth to the experience not always utilized across the genre.\n\nAn ingame currency keeps the experience on a positive path, players are rewarded for higher difficulty mission completions, in-game cash is used to purchase new missions, some on previous levels with special modifiers or objectives adding to the replayability factor.\n\nThe downloadable add-on offered for this game features a small subset of extra weaponry but i would argue that it is purely optional as most players will find progression through the game using the stock offerings is more than sufficient, the games soundtrack is also enjoyable with epic boss battle music.\nGraphics are easy on the eyes with cool explosion effects and well detailed backgrounds. Weapon animations are also a major highlight here also.\n\nA fantastic shooter with great artwork and pixel graphics, an overall satisfying package. 10/10"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1434834721, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502402", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "16564792", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198043627942", "num_reviews": 85, "last_played": 1465391816, "num_games_owned": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 625}, "timestamp_updated": 1434834721, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I really enjoyed this game, and after seeing the teaser for it about 2 years ago, I knew I 'd like it...Here I am today after buying it and I know that I was not wrong at all.  The flow of the game is fast, challenging  and very pleasing to the eye and ear.  It is also , like many retro games, a designed as a 4 player co-op. Overall , This is a very well put game .\n\nThere is nothing hard to understand about Jamestown, it is also pretty easy to play(although I am refering to picking it up and getting used to it, not difficulty)\n\nI have 2 small qualms with Jamestown.  Although the Devs probably wanted you to work hard to complete it ( and my god, I certainly did )  it seems silly that the last  levels are locked, where you have to play levels 1-3 on Legendary difficulty first, which is pretty hard, I guess in most other games I would expect to play the game beginning to end on hard or normal difficulty, not grind away on the harder difficulties before I get that option.  And well the end level is pretty friggin hard too, I spent 4 hpours trying to beat it as it has an intense and really hard to keep track of enviroment which is very celverly laid out, as  well as the boss..,.   In saying that I do kind of get a kick out of getting something for my sweat, so the design option may not be so bad...  \n\nThe next thing is that though this is a retro style top scrolling shooter, on the last level inparticular, I was experiencing some slow down... True enough, there was ALOT happening all at once, however, for such a 'simple ' game, I would expect it to run well on my Dual core which runs most other games farily well.\n\nI did find the very bar bones application of the story quite puzzling, it was good though, particualrly since the whole lay out of the game kind of pushes it.  Also this style is very intesteing too, a sort of steampunk/New world (or what ever it is...,)  style pretty cool.\n\nAfter completting it today, I have bought the Dlc, and would consider it well worth it, its good fun and if you are like me and like challenges, then try completeing it...  Excellent Game\n"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1425683825, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503201", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14766244", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983197518", "num_reviews": 9, "last_played": 1472896942, "num_games_owned": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1005}, "timestamp_updated": 1425683825, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is allround, great bullet-hell game. You could make an argument, that it does not have that many levels and if played on lower difficulties it can be blasted through in 30 minutes or so. However, in its essence, Jamestown is like old arcade shooters, they were never long but their difficulty and the fact that they created a strong competetive scene, were the highlights of this kind of games. On top of scalable difficulty, game offers additional challenges in form of short survival modes, boss battles, going through campagins in gauntlet mode etc. Hard to get bored. \nLast but not least, the esthetics of the game is really interesting, it blends nicely, this old school feeling and still it manages to look modern enough and not too pixelated (see screenshots/video on the store front).\nI am sure that there are games waaaay hardcore in ths genre than Jamestown, but with this one I found myself playing over and over just to get slightly better score and advance through leaderboards.\nGive it a shot."}]}
