I purchased this almost exclusively for the artistry alone so I'm willing to overlook any sort of mechanical flaws; real or perceived (I don't perceive any though). I love this game so far. It's unique and for anyone who knows about claymation, it takes FOREVER.. so kudos. The game has this mysterious element to it that - so far - is not over the top. I *want* to know what happens next. I credit the storytelling and interactive dialogue b/c essentially that's what good storytelling does; makes you want to see how everything turns out. The walking may seem cumbersome if one is expecting typical smooth motions of a point-and-click but remember it's the process of this type of animation. Btw, the \"landlord\" is creepy...\n\nETA: I finished the 1st two chapters but thought I'd purchased the whole game. I went back on my purchase history and sure enough, I only bought the 1st two. I'm only sorry I didn't buy the whole entire game. I really enjoyed this.

The point and click controls and puzzle solving may lead one to believe, at first glance, that this game is a standard, by the numbers adventure game with a stop-motion aesthetic. But much like the apartment in which this game takes place, there is a lot more lying underneath the surface, waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe story is deep, thought-provoking and highly engaging, albeit very surreal and a touch depressing towards the end. This game is one that requires a lot of thought and a lot of patience, because starting around the second chapter, most of the time you will spend playing this game will involve backtracking, and if you are clueless about what is going on, the game can become somewhat tedious and frustrating. All in all, however, the cleverness and surreal gameplay should be enough to keep things interesting.\n\nMild Spoilers: This game contains a lot of claymation gore and a bittersweet ending.  Do not play if either of these things upset you."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504646454, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500513", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34764824", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198060346725", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504645490, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1797}, "timestamp_updated": 1504646454, "received_for_free": false, "review": "A work of art.
