Featuring one hit kills, fast respawns, and a rock, paper, scissors style stance system, Nidhogg at its core is a fun, great concept.  It's easy to pick up and play, and honestly could be a great time...\n\n...If you have someone next to you to play with.  If you're looking for an enjoyable single player experience you won't find it.  The single player features are anemic and feature just endless room after endless room.\n\nI was unable to test the online netcode...because it appears dead.  Even during peak hours, I simply could not find a match.\n\nWhat I was left with was a game that played well but had literally zero features.  The AI suffered from either being a complete push over to Atreides like prescience.\n\nThe art direction, which I enjoyed at first, quickly became vomit enducing in the second or third stage.  Literally, the colors hurt my eyes.\n\nIn the end, if you have RL buddies to play with, I'm sure it's a great game, but with literally no single player features and dead online, there's nothing to see here.  Perhaps it was better at launch, but clearly the overly simple gameplay didn't have the legs.\n\n3/10"}]}
