It did get stuck on ep. 5 because I didn't bring the flower pot with me. Anyway the voice acting is ok and the graphics are nice for this type of game. You may run into audio glitches from time to time while fast forwarding through dialogue. The movement controls can also be trouble some from time to time.\n\nEven with all this, I liked it!"}]}
