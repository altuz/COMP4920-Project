The story continues from the first game and more locations are opened up. Unfortunately, those are about the only good aspects of the sequel.\n\nThe bad:\n\nLocations\nThe game features about the same amount of explorable locations as the first one. While new ones open up, too bad you don't get to visit all presented on the map. The ones you do visit aren't that many.\n\nPuzzles\nEven though there are slightly more puzzles this time around (due to a few extras upon completion), the problem lies in that alot of them are reused from the first game, essentially lowering their diversity. Also, one puzzles requires that you look up the answer, unless you know a certain number to a certain decimal place.  This is simply bad puzzle design in my opinion.\n\nStory\nThe story continues and we finally get to crack the case to the mystery surrounding Scoggins. Unfortunately, the story ends up being convoluted and abruptly ends, as if they ran out of budget or something. We didn't even get to say goodbye to the characters...\n\nValue\nThe first game was $2.99, this was $9.99 for what seemed like a rushed job. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the series but the second game should of been more polished. Buy only for the story and if got money to burn."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1499559686, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33389786", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198103347134", "num_reviews": 99, "last_played": 1499559044, "num_games_owned": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 207}, "timestamp_updated": 1499559686, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is just one of those little games that really commands proper attention. The graphics are cute and the story is almost scary sometimes. If I had played this in the dark I'd have issues. Not nearly as scary as the first one had ended up being but I really like how they developed the story. I really wish they had more with this style of game. Its really quiet good. I highly recommend this for those that love a unusual story with very out the box puzzles."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1502252657, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502797", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34117587", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972040704", "num_reviews": 455, "last_played": 1325491200, "num_games_owned": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 305}, "timestamp_updated": 1502252657, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I liked the first game a bit better, as I found that the mystery was better when I knew less and there was more mystique, but it's still a good game with a simple art style I liked, and it had some well-designed puzzles as well."}]}
