Both games follow similar patterns using the Single player story to introduce you to all the elements of the multi-player (Sadly defunct). Frontline for me did it so much better and had no terrible quick time events. For its age it still holds up well and tells an entertaining enough Story\n\nDrones where its big thing and these are fun to uses throughout the campaign. It also surprised me to remember they used limited respawns even in the Story, forcing you to use your lives wisely and plan a head where you can or face having to restart the multiple objectives again. Enemy AI on Hardcore is a suitable challenge.\n\nGun wise only the Assault rifles feel like they have no impact, but everything else feels fine.\n\nIn its day the Multiplayer was great fun, you weren't safe anywhere because of the drones. The multi stage maps made it feel like a real battle. The game can be played over a lan if anyone still feels the urge."}]}
