Comedy adventure games have routinely relied on lying, cheating and stealing antiheroes as protagonists, but Hector just comes off as crass and dumb. As a character, he has no project or ambition worth caring about, and the crappy town and its annoying inhabitants don't really seem worth saving. Also, the controls are over-simplified to the point where there's little distinction between examining and moving, so you'll spend a lot of time getting read descriptions of doorways you were trying to move through. The game also falls into the classic adventure game trap of combining snarky feedback with faltering logic. Case in point: Stuffing a real, live youth offender in your inventory and then cramming him into your engine compartment to use as a car battery is apparently brilliant. Trying to combine the same youth-offender-as-inventory object with a bag of loot by a broken window gets you told off for being an idiot. Go figure."}, {"votes_down": 12, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1501123488, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469905", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33822784", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198046675266", "num_reviews": 606, "last_played": 1501123394, "num_games_owned": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 6}, "timestamp_updated": 1501123488, "received_for_free": false, "review": "[h1]This game could be decent if it didn't penalize you for understanding its stupid ways of playing.\n\nF*ck this ret@rded game...\n\n1/10[/h1]"}]}
