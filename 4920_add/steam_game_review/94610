After the painful events of Episode 1 (some of which are devastating to our hero's private life), he find himself unarmed and equipped with only one slice of pizza facing a deadly sniper rifle. Great. Any move he makes means absolutely certain death unless he can figure something out and if you know Hector, you know that this means YOU have to figure it out because he certainly can't.\n\nEpisode 2 picks up where Episode 1 left off as you accompany Hector and his reliable-ish sidekick, Lambert, in chasing down the terrorist that forced him to do his bidding in Ep.1. Along the way, he'll be screaming at turds (in more sense than one), mingle with local celebrities and do everything he can to cuff the insane criminal mastermind that continues to elude him.\n\nThere are some issues with this game: mostly, important items look exactly like the backgrounds of the game (which are quite ... nevermind). Also, some of the riddle solutions jump right at you, but the way to accomplish them doesn't and in one case I thought it was very contrived. The Hint-System is marginally more helpful than Lambert (you'll know what this means if you played part 1), but the riddles are, overall, not impossible(-y stupid). Still, if you enjoyed \"We Negotiate with Terrorist\", you will enjoy this one, too. Hector is as crude and rude as we know and love him and the climax of \"Senseless Acts of Justice\" does leave me wanting for more."}]}
