It was really a painfull experience. I had spent over 2 hours trying to navigate the world in the game. This game has hundreds of bugs. I could barely even walk /run/drive in a straight position. Controls are also awful. Game runs soo fast that you are left to wonder where the hell you are moving. I really want to like this game and it sounds cool but I could complete only two main missions. \n\nI bought it for just a dollar at humble bundle and I'm thankful for not spending 10 bucks. Boy, I can't tell how everyone gave this game a positive review. Uninstalled this for good. Gentlemen of the Row didn't seem to work properly well either.\n\nPros\n-Story (at least the first two missions were good)\n-Amazing Graphics (it came out in 2009)\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Nice Open World Free-Roam\n-Character Customization\n\nCons\n~Terrible Port\n~Countless number of bugs\n~Respect system is mandatory to play story\n~Multiplayer is dead\n\nBuy this game only if you're a die-hard fan of the SAINTS ROW series which means you already own it, only recommend buying this on a sale."}]}
