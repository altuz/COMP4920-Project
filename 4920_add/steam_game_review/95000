Super Splatters is so unconcerned with being taken seriously, so committed to making you laugh and smile, that it\u2019s hard not to forgive some of its more frustrating parts for the sake of how much fun it\u2019s having.\n\nSuper Splatters is all about skill in an environment you wouldn\u2019t expect to demand it. Your goal isn\u2019t to do good yourself, but impress the audience watching you and in turn earn fans to help propel you to the next level of splatter stardom. You do this by making an absolute mess, shooting your wiggly body toward small balls you need to cover with your explosive fluids in order to clear a level. The challenge is you\u2019re only given a limited number of goo-people and balls are typically spaced out so as to require a lot of tricky maneuvering to catch them all.\n\nFor a game seemingly aimed at more casual players, Super Splatters has an abundant amount of depth in its scoring system and outrageously difficult level designs later on. Different shots activate stunts, the more of which you chain together the higher your combo gets and the more fans you\u2019ll receive. This becomes fiendishly complex when you have to deal with multiple colors, required stunts, and an increasing number of spikes ready to prematurely split you open.\n\nIssues only arise when Super Splatters\u2019 somewhat luck based design begins to feel as if it\u2019s working against you. As you\u2019re required to clear every level entirely, it\u2019s not uncommon to end up with a single ball remaining do to you goo somehow not penetrating a stack enough, or slipping through the floor faster than you\u2019d anticipate. Later stages are positively infuriating at times, testing my patience with little in the way of direction, and losing much of the cheerful dialogue that made earlier levels such a joy.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s a bit of a baseless complaint though as there isn\u2019t ever a reason you\u2019re forced to play past a comfortable difficulty. Super Splatters is fully focused on giving you as much or as little a challenge as you want, so outside of completionists there\u2019s never a forceful urging to push you outside your comfort zone. And that\u2019s something I find really refreshing: a game so completely devoted to having a ridiculously good time that you can\u2019t help but enjoy yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YQ1k2f26CI&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2015/03/30/super-splatters-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1402030050, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 3, "recommendationid": "10364349", "votes_up": 17, "comment_count": "2", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058069187", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1393951309, "num_games_owned": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 213}, "timestamp_updated": 1402030050, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great graphics that suit the game well with impressive particle effects and explosions,its a very original concept as well i have never played anything like it before.Pity i absolutely suck at it ive watched replays and i still cant do it its not the game obviously some of the guys can pull off mega combos so i put it  down to my limp wristed joypad skills still good fun though and i can recommend it if you fancy something colourful original and challenging."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1385507242, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511376", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "7776146", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198083564393", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1401987596, "num_games_owned": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 920}, "timestamp_updated": 1385507242, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Still Playing!\n\nThis game is very addicting, and I cant stop playing!
