It is worth much much more than what I payed for it.  It makes you feel bad paying such a lousy quantity of money, (about 60 cents because of a 90% discount offer), for the quality of the game, its looks, the gameplay and the effort the developers and designers put there, and...all of it.\n\nI've played it just for a little more than an hour but I have enjoyed every minute of it, I love it. The environment is beautiful, colorful, and very detailed with a cartoonish look the music is good too.\n\nThe gameplay and controls are smooth. Apart from the shooting part, you have to look around and explore because it has some puzzling situations in which you have to think a little  in order to advance in the smoother or tougher way (you have choices). Some other times, you shoot or you shoot, or simply...run to organize your movements.\n\nThis game is GREAT FUN even when you have to die while getting used to the mechanics of it which are not too tough to grab.\n\nYOU MUST buy this game, cheap or at its normal price, if you like well designed and visually sophisticated platformers, and quality gaming, of course. This is NOT \"just another pretty face\""}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505788650, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35056663", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197976483359", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1505787328, "num_games_owned": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 251}, "timestamp_updated": 1505788650, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I enjoyed it.  The controls and movement took a little getting used to.  Some will gripe that the character slides around a bit, and it's true.  But to counter act this you can grab onto walls and wall climb, you've got a hook shot to grapple walls, and you can do a gravity boost jump that's kind of like a rocket jump. The hook shot can really slingshot you around the levels too; some of the later levels are huge and fun to explore this way.  The ol' slingshot move is good for a quick escape too if you happen to stumble into a room full of monsters.\n\nWill definitely play through again someday when I have the time."}]}
