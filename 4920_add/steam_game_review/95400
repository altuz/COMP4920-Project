The double pack is an amazing deal, only adding two dollars to the regular price for an extra copy of the game. It's a perfect gift for a girlfriend/boyfriend/bestfriend and so on, at a price that is a real steal. The art style in game is simplistic and beautiful and very cute to say the least. With a pleasant and calming soundtrack and smooth yet challenging level design the game is relaxing while still making you think to progress through it. The levels and \"worlds\" increase in difficulty, adding twists in each world that add a new layer to the gameplay. Just make sure you and whoever you play with have good communication skills and are up for a challenge, but most of all just enjoy the game. It's much easier to progress with a cool head and by letting the rhythm of the level and the momentum of the moves you use to solve each puzzle advance you forward. I would highly recommend this game to anyone really but especially couples who like a fun challenge."}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505045676, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495629", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 23, "recommendationid": "34860442", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198004843541", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1505044976, "num_games_owned": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 54}, "timestamp_updated": 1505045676, "received_for_free": false, "review": "frustrating game, brought it and played locally with my girlfriend.

Describing this game as a beautiful marriage between creative game physics and elegant gameplay doesn't really do it justice.  Sure, it has the child-like charm of an other-worldly candyland platformer (Kirby's Dreamland) combined with counter-intuitive game mechanics that constantly challenge your battle-tested gamer reflexes and force you to always play with your cerebral cortex in overdrive (say... Portal?)  But, let's be honest:  It's not like this is the first game to use inverted gravity in a platformer (although the mandatory co-op feature is a cool spin on the idea).  The real genius of this game is in its simple elegance.  The controls are intuitive (even when the physics are not), and the ultra-stripped down minimalist shapes that comprise not only the backgrounds, but even the game's nebulous protagonists could have come off as childish or unambitious, but instead seem to be exactly what the game calls for; a beautiful but unassuming graphical landscape that leaves the brilliant puzzles nothing to hide behind.  I could (and did) get lost in this game for hours, and can't wait to go back for more.\n\nAll that for $10?
