You play a female protagonist named DeeDee who, being a pilot smuggler gets caught up into World War II. And she serves with a man who personally flew and fought with her father in World War One. As the missions progress, the story unfolds through static cut scenes that have a pleasant cell shaded hand drawn look. Missions vary from stealthy strike missions to all out balls to the wall multi-plane dogfights. If you\u2019re looking to play an IL-2 Sturmovik imitation, look elsewhere; this is strictly for the arcade fans. Difficulty can be toggled, but some missions are more difficult than they have any right to be. One particular mission toward the end involved destroying fleeing vehicles through the city of Berlin. Tall buildings made it difficult to get decent bombing runs or rocket attacks, and it took me over 50 tries to get it. (But at this point, being so close to the end I had to finish it!) \n\nGraphics are okay, serving the purpose. They look console-ish, and the voice acting is pretty much done by three people. One guy doing four different men\u2019s voices with different accents is cheesy to the point of being hilarious. The music score, on the other hand, is polished and grandiose. It\u2019s on par with a Stephen Spielberg Hollywood feature. I even looked during the end credits to find out who the composer was. Sadly, he was not credited. \nThe game offers multiplayer, but servers were pretty scant. I did find one each time I logged on, and this is probably a testament to the game\u2019s age. It was fun, but mostly consisted of aerial jousts with rockets being launched at each other. A lot of my kills were dumb luck. \n\nI won\u2019t be in a hurry to play the original [b]Air Conflicts[/b] or [b]Air Conflicts: Vietnam[/b], but if you have a few bucks left in your Steam Wallet during a Summer or Winter Steam sale, you could do worse.\n"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1438656475, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509541", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "17376804", "votes_up": 6, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198072637934", "num_reviews": 21, "last_played": 1438700647, "num_games_owned": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 260}, "timestamp_updated": 1438656475, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Its a good game not a realistic game though however multiplayer is arcadey which i like a lot overall if your looking for a sim this isnt the game but if your looking for an arcade kinda game this is worth it."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1433179531, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507830", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "16119212", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198014922772", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1434514455, "num_games_owned": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1131}, "timestamp_updated": 1433179531, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I'm about 10 missions in and enjoying it.

Flak? Anti-Air? Anyone?] that they probably were a little scared of how the second would turn out) but they managed to make this game a very, VERY, good budget game, especially for $10.\nI'm not sure what people are talking about with the low resolution stuff. These past two weeks I've been able to play it in full 1920 x 1080, no iffy decals or anything. Though, on my laptop (I used to play this on a laptop, ran pretty well actually) I encountered a bug where the text, some of the logos, and most of the decals were very, very, low res. Didn't happen to me when I played it on my desktop, though.\nI'll cover a few key parts:\nGameplay - For a budget game (budget game in this context is something that doesn't have EA throwing money at it) the gameplay is excellent, furthurmore with it only being $10. It CAN be repetitive and frustrating at times, but it was still a fun game, for me at least.\nVoice acting - Lemme let you in on a little secret I bet a lot of people didn't notice. They had, I believe it was four or five (can't remember) voice actors, for about eight or so characters. Don't believe me? Watch the credits. Despite this, those voice actors deserve some (a lot) of credit. Personally I heard some similarites, never suspected it was because they were all the same voice actor. I just thought it was (no offense) the English accent.\nGraphics - In my opinion, 9.5/10. You must remember this is \"AIR conflicts\" not \"GROUND conflicts\" they put a lot of work into the planes to make them detailed. Seriously, the machine gun bullets ACTUALLY shoot out of the machine guns! (This is a big deal because this is pretty rare among air sims under $20) The ground graphics were sacrificed, of course. I was able to fly through some of the buildings to a point without exploding, as an example. The building textures seem low res as well. But if you want this game for it's ground graphics, you really should spend your $10 on a FPS shooter.\nCamera - VERY well suited for this game. You can change camera locations, such as 3rd person, in-cabin without the cockpit visible, in-cabin with the cockpit visible. There's also a follow bomb/missile ability.\nMissiles are NOT lock-on/tracking. You must manually aim them. As said in-game, they did not have tracking missiles during WW2.\nMy experience was probably made better by the fact that I have a joystick (Logitech Extereme 3D Pro)\n\nAll in all, the game is worth the $10, in my opinion."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1426600753, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500476", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "14933470", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198035465882", "num_reviews": 45, "last_played": 1426600593, "num_games_owned": 1002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 40}, "timestamp_updated": 1426600753, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Great game!
