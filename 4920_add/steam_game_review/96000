Apart from that, the puzzles are mostly very good, the art design is hand drawn and absolutely cute, the soundtrack fits extremely well and then there's again a minor flaw with some very few hidden items being close to impossible to find without the hint system.\n\nAll in all it's a neat 3-4 hours playthrough and worth the asking price in my opinion."}]}
