Modules have an effect (e.g. fire rockets) every few seconds and the goal is to raze the foe's tower. Nobody I played this with every appreciated having to multitask the tetris with the combat. They just feel like two different mental processes that compete with each other rather than complement each other. Having to play five levels single player to unlock local co op was also an unwelcome surprise. Removed for declutlter."}]}
