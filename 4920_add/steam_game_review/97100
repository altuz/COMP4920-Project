For $2 it's an awesome game and playing six years after it's release really shows how it was ahead of it's time.  You can see where Titanfall and COD heavily borrowed from this game.  I've only played the campaign which doesn't seem very involved but it is enjoyable.  If you can get it under $10 it's probably worth it."}]}
