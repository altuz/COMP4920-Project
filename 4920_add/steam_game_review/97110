In particular, the way troops are organized into squads that gradually replenish themselves while in home territory really takes a lot of clicking out of the equation.  The clickfest thing has always pushed me away from RTSes, so it's no wonder I found this appealing.\n\nI owned a retail copy of this game more than 10 years ago, and when I found it on Steam I wound up getting it so I could finally finish playing through the campaign.  I tend to hop from game to game a lot and not finish things, but this was one I wanted to play to the end.  I finally beat it (it's not particularly difficult on Normal, except for the last level; I haven't tried Hard yet), and am looking forward to trying the other two Kohan titles that exist.\n\nFrom a modern eye, there are one or two things to put up with when playing this dated title.  The low resolution is a given, as is the resulting small viewable area.  When you order your troops around, or even click to select them, their vocal acknowledgements are annoying and repetitive.  Various other small bits of interface clunkiness, but overall I think you'll be surprised how many things they did get right.\n\nThe Kohan series never made it big, and it's certainly not a well-known IP.  Kind of a shame; perhaps someday someone will acquire the rights and take another stab at it.  Then again, the story is not really the selling point for me."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1391758086, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528602", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "9003166", "votes_up": 16, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197972569732", "num_reviews": 13, "last_played": 1451779141, "num_games_owned": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 277}, "timestamp_updated": 1391758086, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I used to play this game relentlessly in the early-mid 2000s. I had this game installed on my machine when it came out on steam and I picked it up and logged a few hours in (I had recently played probably around 50 hours or so not on steam).\n\nPros in General: Great graphics for the time (the magic effects are particularly satisfying). Fantastic gameplay. Hillarious voice acting.\n\nPros for Oldies: If you remember this game, get it. It's just as good as you remember it honestly. The gameplay is fantastically deep and rewarding still. The ability to mix and match front line units with support units remains as engaging as ever. You will be barrelled over laughing at the quality of the voice acting. It's so horrible that I can't consider a Con, it's just SO bad it's good! Seriously you'll love it. If you remember this game get it. And if you like games from this time period for their difficulty but sense of reward, get it.\n\nPros for Newbies: If you're a fan of strategy games and you're looking for something TOTALLY different to what you've played before then get this. It's very difficult to truly describe the game but here's a shot. You have the ability to form a line of main troops (spearmen, archers, swordsmen, etc) and then give them a captain and two support units (cleric, mage, sorccerer, more spearmen, etc) and it's this combination that makes this game interesting. Finding the right faction and combination of units for you is a real treat as you will find new and exciting combinations and playstyles constantly for different situations. Each of the different factions plays very differently even though some seem to differ superficially with some skin changes and a few number differences with a unit change or two they are actually significant. If you're unfamiliar with games from this time period they're a lot more unforgiving than they are nowadays but not in a cruel way. More in a way that makes you realise you made a tactical error and the enemy beat you fair and square.\n\nCons in General: It's a difficult game at first. Since some of the factions are essentially reskins with a few stat and unit changes, the battles can look pretty boring at times.\n\ntl;dr: Get it if you remember it or not. Great graphics, fun voice acting, a bit difficult, but will have you feeling rewarded and like a hero of the land in no time."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1389444142, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509498", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "8661208", "votes_up": 8, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197983601366", "num_reviews": 52, "last_played": 1492967443, "num_games_owned": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 1374}, "timestamp_updated": 1389444142, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Kohan is a unique strategy game which blends the rts and turn based strategy genre together. It borrows many concepts from other games and add some features of its own which creates a very enjoyable experience. All things considered, Kohan is a hidden gem that has long been forgotten but has aged quite well. It has lenghty campaigns, great multiplayer and offers quite a challenge.\n\nThe game plays like a realtime Heroes of Might and Magic combined with rts combat that requires more strategy and planning instead of fast reaction like most rts games do. It's all about training well balanced companies that can overcome the enemy and taking the terrain to your advantage. You need to conquer cities, outposts and ressources in order defeat your opponents.\n\nThe ressource system is also fairly unique and allows for some strategizing, instead of gathering ressources you can erect different buildings which give you ressources which are used by other buildings or units. If you lack any ressources, this will be compensated by a heavy gold cost. This allows for some variation and is pretty flexible.\n\nOverall it's highly recommended for players who are longing for an unique and great rts.\n\nThe only downside that I can think of is that the graphics are dated and that you can't change the resolution. Nevertheless the sprites and animations are really good for such an old game."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1412185996, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506696", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "12316169", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007367466", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1443136629, "num_games_owned": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 3550}, "timestamp_updated": 1412185996, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is worth giving a try.\n\nKohan games have existed for some time now and are each of them one of those 'golden oldies hidden gems', imo. \nI wouldn't even go so far as to name a particular one that is nicer than another, although graphic-wise I'd recommend to try Kohan 2 if interested anyway.\n\nThis game is an RTS, with simple base/building management, aimed at larger groups of units clashing with nice graphics involving the 'magic' used by the units. \nMicromanagement is very much canceled out, as to be able to keep focus on the units that walk around the map.\nThe gameplay is simple and has a very natural learning curve. Compared to just starting the game, the tutorial is rather storybuilding, useful at best.\n\nUnit management is easy and clumsy at the same time. Little, though effective options for movement, sight range, attack, defend and retreat are amongst the choices. As soon as units are engaged in combat, only an option to flee or to rout the unit will cause them to break the fight. This can be annoying, but when you get around a bit with the game, is no issue at all and 'flee' can be used for ease of deploying troups somewhere else. Groups upto 6 units can be selected at once, and you can asign group settings as for movement. It doesn't work perfect at times, for some formations end up in a long line instead of a focused stance, but with a little moving them manually, it'll do.\n\nThe game itself has quite some missions. Enough to be rewarding. The storyline is nice, if you feel for such thing, though the narrative can be quite boring to 'have to' listen to. I liked it.\nYou in general start with a town, in which you can build a maximum of 4-7 components. The components are chosen out of 8, each having a choice of 2-3 upgrades afterwards with a variety of effects, so a very simple variety per town and it's abilities/purpose exists.\nIn the end the thing is: make enough money and get enough resources to build and support the units, upgrade the town, upgrade the components, do battle.\n\nThe units, of 5-7 members, are created from options that are reliant on the buildings in the settlement, You pick a frontline unit (4), support units (2) and a captain. By picking from various options of available units, you can slightly manage how you want to play your battles.\nInstead of the Captain, you can also pick from the Kohan available to you, which is a stronger (storyline) character, that becomes stronger by staying alive and defeating opponents.\n\nHidden in the large maps, are items, more Kohan charaters and some treasure. There are most of the time enough critters, independents and enemies to keep you busy while expanding, exploring and conquering with your units.\nThe maps graphically could've been better, though back in the days was fair. The game to me is more about the battle graphics and large scale unit clashes.\n\nDon't expect an RTS, like the traditional RTS games given birth by westwood studio's. This is just a different style, laying the focus a bit more on fighting, expanding, planning and moving than actual basebuilding and resource gathering. Micromanagement is as said possible, but simplified. The AI could've been better, but what to expect from an oldie like this. It still manages to give you quite a busy time when playing hard mode.\n\nWant to try something different? \nKohan is worth it, in my opinion. Buy it in a sale if you don't want to spend on sight, either you like it, or you dislike it I guess, nothing much in between."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1479955279, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505533", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "26994977", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198010785061", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1448137592, "num_games_owned": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 990}, "timestamp_updated": 1479955279, "received_for_free": false, "review": "TLDR; This game is a hidden classic.\n\nAs my first RTS game, it helped ease me into the RTS genre.
