I've been playing it since it came out in 2001 and only recently downloaded the Steam version to connect with friends who had lost their CDs (I have one signed by the devs... I know, I'm a KAG geek).  \n\nIt has some of the most dynamic AI and gameplay of its day, and games never feel old to me no matter how many times I play them.  I really enjoy the company dynamics, the presence of techs, and the way you can create your own units, maps, and AIs to customize the game to your taste (look up KMod if you're interested).   In fact, my partner and I have created 7 epic campaigns that we play all the time, each featuring different Kohan and types of challenges.   Tinkering with AIs is also great fun (look for The Awakening fan site to download tons).\n\nAnyway, I recommend KAG if you like retro games and want to try something different.

This is one of the best most overlooked RTS games every to come out. it is VASTLY superior to the socalled KohanII.\nThe RTS game has simplistic city management, where you have 'cities on the map' that have slots for buildings that you build, but you do not have to micromanage where they go etc... they are 'in the city' they give you benefits like being able to recruit better units or resources, etc.\nResource management is also unique, although it is technically divided up into Wood, Stones, Iron, and Magic Khaldunite, each have a monetary value and will be imported when they are lacking.  so gold is the only real 'resource'.  It updates per second, based on your income.  If you want to build spearmen troops, each unit squad within the unit will take one of the wood for example, so if you have 5 wood produced, you cn make a 5 spearman unit with no penalty, if you make 6 in there, then it will cost you some of your gold income every second to 'supply' the extra wood, etc.\nComabt is also EXCELLENT, the units each can take damage, but also have a unit morale.  Once their zone of control overlapps an enemy unit, they will engage, sending frontline units up while rear units will bring up the rear with raged attacks of possible or charge in secondly if not.  The only order you can give it when to retreat and where to retreat to (or to rout, where they flee willy nilly) if they get broken morale, they will flee without the order.  you have to return them to friendly supply zones for them to restore their combat effectiveness.  Terrain matters, formations matter, Defensive outposts can provide extra garrison and supply zones... special squads can be added to units to change how they fight... \nThe single player campaign is honestly mediocre, but the multiplayer and battles in this game are still some of the best I've ever played and that's over 12 years since it's been released.\nI can't recommend this enough."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1456881870, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505562", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "21575929", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203271087", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1483347868, "num_games_owned": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 7569}, "timestamp_updated": 1456881870, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Kohan was one of the best online strategy games I had played with a great group of players who enjoyed each others company.
