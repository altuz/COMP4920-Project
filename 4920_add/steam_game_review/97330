Why not include a choice to make it happen all at once? instead of 1 by 1. For example ask everyone if they are going to answer to the effect or not, if not then do it all at once? idk how many hours I lost because of that. games that should take 10 or 15 mins takes more than twice or three that easily. Imagine that you are playing 2 headed dragon and somehow all the players have all of their 4 soul warden on the battlefield, thats 16 soul warden on the battlefield and suddenly 100 creatures enter the battlefield, if it takes 1 second for the effect to happen(which it doesnt) thats 1600 second which is around 26 mins of just waiting until the effect is over you can play.\n-FREAKING SMALL TIMER BETWEEN PHASES AND FOR ANSWERING AN EFFECT OR WHEN A CREATURES ENTER THE BATTLEFIELD\nas in if you are not paying attention then you dont get to do what you were planning to do.\n-FREAKING RNG IS BAD\nEither you get 10 continuous lands or 10 turns with no lands. I played games where I still dont get lands after 20 turns.\n\nIf you like magic then its still a ok game but be prepared to lose most of your games against AI."}, {"votes_down": 10, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1493172354, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496753", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "31368176", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198170255946", "num_reviews": 10, "last_played": 1493087481, "num_games_owned": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 128}, "timestamp_updated": 1493172354, "received_for_free": false, "review": "You can't edit your decks, so what the hell is the point of a Magic: The Gathering game?
