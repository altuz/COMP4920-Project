The entire franchise.\n\nAct of War: Direct Action had elements I never saw in Command and Conquer. For example, entering buildings was new but you had to first destroy the building or clear the enemy out before re-capturing it. A lot of times once the enemy had it, you couldn't take it from them. Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2 is a good example. In Act of War: Direct Action, if an enemy has a building and you want it, you must send in your infantry to fight for it. Your infantry will garrison the building and fight indoors to wrest control over it. Usually whomever has the most units or highest ranking units wins and the survivors are placed outside to be captured or left for dead.\n\nI forgot to mention one of the best features of the game! You can capture wounded enemy infantry or non-combatants like vehicle crews or pilots. On the map, the resource is oil. You will eventually run out of it and once you do, well, you're sort of stuck. You'll get no more money. At all. Unless you have a hospital handy and enough to train some infantry. Wound some enemies, destroy some vehicles, and capture the infantry. Each enemy you capture gives you immediate money plus $50 every ~30 seconds. Each hospital can hold 10 prisoners so that's $500 every ~30 seconds. You can have an unlimited amount of hospitals to gain more and more money.\n\nUnits also gain veterancy based on kills and captures. When they attain new veterancy, their health bar increases and they get a small surge of healing/repairing for a few seconds. They also become more deadly.\n\nNot to mention that each faction of the 3 available is unique in its own way. I usually pick favourites in RTS games but not this one. I can't. I absolutely love all 3 factions for different playstyles.\n\nBuilding in this game was interesting too. The buildings were awesome and the animations for each structure fit amazingly. Airdropping a vehicle? You can watch it do so at no additional cost to wait time - the animation IS part of the wait time. Works for all types of structures.\n\nYou could call in airstrikes which I thought was amazing, but could make a game very difficult. There were lots of upgrades, vehicles, and infantry. The game was amazing.\n\nWhat made it the best for me was how everything reacted to each other. In other games like Command and Conquer, infantry inside of a building could make short work of a tank. In Act of War: Direct Action, a tank takes less damage from small arms fire and can punch holes in structures. If hit in the right spot, can wipe out a small group of garrisoned infantry. Most of the time the building catches fire and it varies in size and can sometimes envelope the entire screen, making it hard to see what's going on. What else? Infantry can be placed on top of buildings - on the roofs. It doesn't really provide any extra cover or other bonuses but it's awesome. Sometimes I like to airdrop mortars on top of structures - like banks - to rain hell on the enemy and protect them from enemy tanks.\n\nI can easily say I put over 1,000 hours into this game during the years I owned it. Of course, I owned it on disc. I still do, actually. I still find it to be the absolute best RTS game out there, right next to Company of Heroes 2 presently for realism. \n\n[h1]Review for [i][u]Act of War: High Treason[/u][/i][/h1]\nPretty much just an expansion of all the above but with added features.\n\n-New campaign which doesn't really add up to the enjoyability of the Direct Action campaign\n-New units which are awesome\n-Mercenaries\n-Ship combat (only for multiplayer unless mods?)\n-New maps\n-Changed gameplay elements (some are annoying)\n-Lots of Engagement customization for playing skirmish against AI.\n\nOtherwise, it's the exact same as above. I only recently bought High Treason a couple years ago but either way, it pretty much gives me Direct Action with more features so I'll play this one. :)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAct of War: Direct Action and Act of War: High Treason are two of the best RTS games out there. Definitely pick them up. Both of them. Play them. Enjoy them. They are classics and you will probably never find anything like this again in your life.\n\nVery cheap too for such an awesome game! :D\n\nP.S.\nIf you want an awesome campaign, play Direct Action. High Treason's is meh. :) Both games are $6.58CAD, so roughly $5USD? Worth it. :)"}]}
