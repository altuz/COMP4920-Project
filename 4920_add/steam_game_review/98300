I got it at 2 dollars during steam summer sale because I thought it was just your standered tower and defence game. I was far from wrong. The game comes with 4 different campaigns and multiplayer. In the campaigns you get 1 French one, 1 British one, 1 German one and one ALIEN ONE!!! There was a few glitches with the tank mostly SOUND. One thing that was so great about this game though was that you COULD CONTROL THEM! Which was amazing. Though your teams AI is really bad so when you get really high up in the levels it get a little annoying. At the current moment I won't be able to complete the game since summer running out and have more games to play before it ends. (sadly) BUT I will totally finish it in the future. I was orginally buying this game because I was interested in WW1 games and I thought this would be neat just because of the WW1 aspect but now I really kinda want the new one which is Toy Soldier: Cold War.\n\n8 out of 10\nSome glitches and High Levels AI can get annoying\nEverything else was great about a tower and defence game. (CAN CONTROL THE GUYS!)\nWorth the 10 bucks!"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504516537, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504542", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "34730805", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198256029569", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1504517055, "num_games_owned": 3, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 420}, "timestamp_updated": 1504516537, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I love this game omg its so fun the most likely part are the bosses imagination has been put in this game great work!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1500002539, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506018", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33527265", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004689651", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1500009829, "num_games_owned": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 66}, "timestamp_updated": 1500002539, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game is stupid fun.
