There is no cover system you gotta re-learn strafing, but you have to also remember to over-strafe kinda because you seem to have a larger hitbox than average.\n\nYou collect health packs, ammo packs, and upgrade points to buy upgrades for your guns, your armor however will repair itself after a few moments of not being rushed at by robots.\n\nMaps are linear you go from point A to B to C to the next level so no Far Cry style open world.\n\nMy only real beef with this game so far is the grenade launcher, it sort of underhand tosses the grenades and they bounce off enemies and usually return to sender like an explosive wiffle ball.\n"}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506306273, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506089", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35194793", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198018756617", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1344063600, "num_games_owned": 2810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 932}, "timestamp_updated": 1506373293, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I liked this game very much but since the new Redux has been released I have been angry at the studio.

The game mostly doesn't fit my stylistic preferences but still I think has some objective flaws. It also has, in my opinion, a major lack of features and depth both in its gameplay and story. \n\nPros\n+Graphics are pretty good and it has a good art style to it. \n+Map design in its appearence is good and varied, but not in a gameplay sense, see cons. \n+The gun play is only decent. But a plus none-the-less. \n\nCons\n-The animations. There are none. Just 2D portraits of people talking. When I say talk, I mean the picture just alternates between two different photos with slightly different mouth positions. Dreadful. \n-The characters. There are none. The protagonist(and every other) is only seen in cheap comic book-like cut scenes. He doesn't even have hands that you can see while playing. \n-The voice acting. Cringy. This is more preference, but I hate the voice of the main character. He tries so hard to be overly badass and hardened. I felt the same way about the main character in BulletStorm. It just is so cliche and akward to listen to for me. Most of the time I just wanted him to shut up. \n-The guns. There are two (technically). While they slightly change shape when switchting between \"modules\" among the two weapons, the guns just don't feel that satisfying to use and sometimes just piss me off on their balancing. There are only two ammo types and the modules just take different amounts per shot.  The only cool gun is the Smart Gun. It shoots guided projectiles throw walls. \n-The effects. They are distracting and annoying. For example, when you sprint, or say walk slightly faster, the screen blurs so much its like you litterally poored vasaline in your eyeballs. WTF. When using the normal machine gun, the muzzle flash and such is so disorienting that I can't see what I'm aiming at! Explosions and other screen effects are just too much too in my opinion. \n-The story. What is even going on? Maybe it was the cheap cut-scenes or the bad voice acting that prevented me from getting involved in the story. Or maybe there is just such a lack of developent and variation that the whole time playing this I just felt confused. Now this clearly isn't the selling point of this game, I get that, but I fell they almost tried to make it one but stopped short to fulling fleshing it out. \n-Gameplay. Very repetetive and restricted. Not a always a bad thing in all games, but in this one, it is. You are pretty much forced into these small to medium sized areas and forced to kill everything there. No problem, but it wont let you go back or forward into another area until you have killed every last enemy, which 3 times took me a couple minutes to find becuase it glitched out. The areas are okay mostly but some are just poorly designed with combat in mind. Between these larger fights you just walk through halls and streets solving repetive tasks/puzzles to unlock the next area (if killing them doesn't). You also have to backtrack a few times which I HATE. \n-Difficulty. Not consistent. I grew up playing Serious Sam, which by the way, is also a \"old-school\" styled shooter but does everything better than this, and that game wasn't too hard for me on normal. But this game I found very difficult for normal difficulty. Some games when you die its no big deal, but after a while I got very annoyed. There is also very inconsistent autosave points. Sometimes they would be right before something, and others they would be way back at the beginning of the level. \n\nOverall this game just feels cheap and poorly done. I know it is old but that doesn't change anything. I mean look at half-life 2. That game has aged great and thats over a decade old. \n\nRating 3/10\nValue: 1$ I got it for $1.50. I want my 50 cents back please."}]}
