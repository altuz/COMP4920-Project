Game looks half decent for when it was released. It crashed the first time I created a profile and tried playing but restarting the game allowed me to play. The second tutorial bugged out after I spawned the tank at the helipad. Campaign initiated after a few janky intro movies. The voice acting for the units, and general flavor of the game seemed appropriate but did not have a lot of character. On-screen text was barely readable due to size."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1498906884, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501168", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "33078753", "votes_up": 3, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198007261819", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 86400, "num_games_owned": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 339}, "timestamp_updated": 1498906884, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This game doesn't even remotely work.
