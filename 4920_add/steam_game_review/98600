It looked like a fun puzzle blow up so I gave it a shot.\n\nWhat I really liked about the game is the variety you use to destroy what you need to destroy. The goal of the game is to bring down all the buildings in the area and to raise green areas. How you do it though is up to you and the resources you got to do it. What's exceptional to me about video games is the ability to have ENTIRE control (so when I play RTS I want to be able a single unit from FPS stand point or RTS). Demolition INC sort of let's you do that as you can manually control a few cars. The physics engine while jumping a car off a ramp then slamming into 3 buildings while hitting a propane tank is quite fun.\n\nWould I recommend this game as something extremely worth playing? Depends on what you like. If it's on sale I would say buy it for sure.\n\nRATING : 6.9/10\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1374194272, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511713", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "620015", "votes_up": 15, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197973220100", "num_reviews": 22, "last_played": 1323072000, "num_games_owned": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 95}, "timestamp_updated": 1374194272, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Small puzzle like game, saw a demo of it and looked interesting, however not the best thing really so if you like a casual game with some challeges then this is the game for you."}, {"votes_down": 3, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1323048225, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510630", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "388763", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970286203", "num_reviews": 138, "last_played": 1375386238, "num_games_owned": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 810}, "timestamp_updated": 1323048225, "received_for_free": false, "review": "This is probably the only good indie puzzle game ever made.

Essentially, you need to use the vehicles that are driving around the allocated areas to force them to destroy buildings. This sounds fun, but it fails on a technical level. The limitations set by the devlopers decreases game longevity as there's no point in returning to the game.  \nIn addition, the game areas need to be larger and have more happening. Instead of relying mostly on the vehicles, there should be other items, tools, props, as well as other objectives to use and/or complete.
