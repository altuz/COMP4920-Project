It seems perfect. A friend gets you and another life-time subscriptions. Then the game releases and there are countless nerfs that hinder the fun of the game. They then treat the game as more or less done, buggy as all hell and no content. Max level is 40, and the only notable update is that they gave up on the game, sold it, and the new dev made it F2P with most fun stuff premium only.\n\nI guess they did release some furry heads that looked terrible. So I guess there's that."}]}
