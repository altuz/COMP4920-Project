[/h1]\n\nIt's taken me a while to write this review - because I CAN'T STOP PLAYING.\n\n[i] Thou art a pimple on the dungeon floor! [/i]\n\nI used to play a dungeon based game called Larn when I should have been studying. In those days PCs only had two colours and in that game walls were portrayed using the '#' and 'U' was reserved for a creature called Umber Hulk. The little 'g' was a creature called Gelatinous Cube. I hated that guy. The whole world was built using key board characters which allowed your imagination to flourish. Cue deep romantic sigh.\n\n30 years later we define games like Larn as part of the Roguelike genre and happily for all of us Steam has a pretty good collection.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor has quite a few roguelike elements. \n\n[i] Thine eyebrows cannot protect you this time! [/i]\n\nRandom dungeons, loot, knocking down doors, permanent death and save game wipe, cash to buy things from shops, turn based combat, funky music, a heavy eye browed hero, pointy hats, wands, an archaeologist...hmm.\n\nLet's just say there is a lot here and some things can be turned off, like the perma-death or reduced, like game difficulty.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the game is simple to play but diabolically difficult to beat. In 200 hours I managed to beat the evil Lord Dredmor...once.\n\nI liked the following elements:\n\nCharacter creation: Choose your skills or have them randomly assigned. Concentrate on the standard Fighter, Mage, Rogue areas or just go crazy. \n\n[i] You do know I am at least five levels above you! [/i]\n\nThe Archaeology class includes the ability to send an artefact to the giant, secret scary government room full of boxes, and gain experience equal to its value.\n\nThe Blood Magic class includes the ability to pour your blood and soul into a secret hidden thing when you can tap when the need is greatest - or whenever you fancy a nip of forbidden sanguine juices.\n\nIt's nuts and I love it. Part of the problem in this game is figuring out what anything does. My current guy is concentrating on Polearms as his melee option and has completed the Very Long Stick Damage Enhance Training. How funny words translate to real dungeon mechanics can be a nightmare to figure out.\n\nGraphics and Sound: It's very bright and loud. Simple stuff. Almost annoying. Deceptive because you often walk around the dungeon having a fun time then wallop! - you have one health point left.\n\nCrafting: Look simple but pure crazy. Tinkering, Smithing, Alcheming, Pressing, Making Potioning and Wands. You can cultivate mushrooms and other fungus on dead bodies. It's almost like its own minigame. \n\nMonster zoo: It's a room filled with monsters. Filled to the brim. Each level from the second onwards has a zoo and behind every door that opens, might be a zoo. \n\n[i] We have ways of making you talk! [/i]\n\nPanic? Yes\nRan away like a coward? Yes.\nCame back and died? Yes and yes.\nTried to avoid? Yes.\n\nThe character screen itself is hideously complex. There are loads of stats defining your character and many more little symbols defining the various resistances. \n\nLet's just say I don't always know what things do. It's the biggest problem in the game. Behind all the fun and simple gameplay we have this nuclear physicist busting a gut working through all sorts of complex formula and statistics. The game is almost bursting through its seams.\n\n[i] You walk like an undead turkey! [/i]\n\nAnd I love it.\n\nI also recommend Don't Starve and Dungeon of the Endless.\n"}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506843085, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494648", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35368263", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198131130492", "num_reviews": 12, "last_played": 1506754409, "num_games_owned": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "playtime_forever": 77}, "timestamp_updated": 1506843085, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I really wanted to like this game... I REALLY DID... \nIt looked like it would remind me of Chocobo's Dungeon 2.\nIt is kinda like that, but it's waaay too much going on at once.\nThe dungeons are randomized, okay that's not bad. \nThe graphics aren't buggy and I found no issues with the game running.\nThere's no controller support, which I thought about setting up one on xpadder but it would've been worse playing that way with the layout of the controls.\nYour character is a mess of a million different stats that don't make sense. You want a wizard to wield a great axe? By all means, go ahead, this game isn't gonna stop you... But if you want to use mushrooms you gotta have the skill. So inconsistant! \nThen, you constantly run into the same two monsters which drop a plethora of items so your inventory is full before you finish half the map on the first floor. Where's the pleasure in getting everything you need EVER before getting into the game?\nYou pray for side quests, which they make no effort to tell you anything about them, and when you finish it(if you even figure out wtf they meant), it doesn't feel very gratifying. \nThere's random \"graffiti\" on the walls in which they tell you to write down somewhere because they didn't program your character to have the capacity of learned knowledge, so I wrote the ones I found down, then never found anything for which I needed them.\nWhat is the goal, anyway? Oh, yeah, the beginning cutscene explains it in a massive paragraph that I didn't differenciate between a loading screen and plot so I missed it. I think you're going after some evil or getting treasure or something dull, I'm guessing because the game never shows any indication of explaination for anything.\nThere's an option for permadeath... Why would you do that to yourself? Roguelike games are made so when you have to start over, there's perks from playing before. Is the perk slowly figuring out wtf you're supposed to be doing besides killing a bunch of blobs, ducks, and bats? \nThere's random stuff that constantly happens, like an anvil that when you put an item on it, it either is pleased with you and makes it better, or not and I dunno what happens because the 5 times I found the anvils, they were always pleased.\nThere's statues that you can break that give you a lot more exp than an actual fight... for apparently no reason \"heroic vandalism\".\nThere's been one monster that I ran into that was actually hurting me (and I mean like it changed my facial portrait once). I'm assuming it was a boss monster, and it gave me ten times the amount of exp than a regular monster, but nothing happened. Was it supposed to be a bigger fight for no reason?\nI gained 7 levels before exiting the first floor, and in those levels, I figured out that the skill tiers felt more and more meaningless as time went on... I picked the banker atribute thinking \"Okay, money skill, must be important...\" NOPE!\nThere's a shop that tells you that you can pick up stuff without paying for it, then you can't even fight the shopkeeper when he \"stops\" you from leaving(He blocks the only entrance/exit to the room and you can't move past him). You also can't travel to another demension in the shop. I got stuck in the shop because I sold an item and filled his tables, but I picked up an item I didn't pay for and I dropped it on the ground but he still wouldn't move and I couldn't afford anything else to put it back on a table because I JUST STARTED and the item I sold only gave me like 10 coins. I had to restart. I later learned you could quick sell and not take up tablespace in the shop... WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO KNOW!\nI tried using my get a loan skill that was in the corner of my screen, nothing happened. Still never figured out how to make that work.\nI'm not going to do a pros and cons because my rant is far too long for that to even matter.\nIt would be great with some tutorials and a better movement system that would make you interact with something by walking into it instead of just walking into it \ni.e. if you use the arrow keys to move, you'll step on traps, but if you click on it, you can attempt to disarm the traps... WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE so if you use the arrow keys, you'll likely die from traps, leading to a TON of clicking to move, which is incredibly arduous. (PLEASE PLEASE play Chocobo's Dungeon 2 for psx, that controller layout was fantastic and it's such a better game)\nOR If you find a treasure chest, or a door, you can't open them by walking itno them... The treasure chest you just walk through, and you just don't move with the door. \nOkay, this was waaaay longer than I anticipated. This game deserves a 2/10. I could see where you were going, but this feels very unfinished. If this were early access, I could understand and wouldn't have been so harsh."}, {"votes_down": 4, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505663520, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498751", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "35026755", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561197970934254", "num_reviews": 84, "last_played": 1505628584, "num_games_owned": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 812}, "timestamp_updated": 1505663520, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I know, I know, many gamers feel every game should be recommended and liked. However, if every game only got accolades, then the review process would be somewhat worthless.\n\nWhile this game may be for great for most, for me it wasn't and here's why.\n\nPros:\n- Many different skills and play styles\n- Three difficulties\n- Can turn perma-death off\n- Saving\n- Extremely difficult final boss--even on the easiest difficulty\n\nCons:\n- Some of the skills are weak, and if you don't pick some of the good skills you are severely handicapped.\n- Speed is either to slow or fast\n- If your player noticed a trap, they should auto try to disarm when moving, stop movement, or prompt you to proceed\n- Resolution makes it hard to tell icons and read text--this may be solve if playing on a 32\" monitor, however, a 15\" laptop screen is challenging\n- The use of chokes makes it way easier, however, a bit boring\n- The controls just feel weird\n- Crafting is a pain--you can only craft 1 highlighted item, not select anything on the screen\n- What seems random isn't, the rooms can be memorized (trap locations, items, etc)\n- Inventory is small, and there are a lot of items\n- I missed the humor part, didn't seem funny"}, {"votes_down": 17, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1504652087, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477118", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 4, "recommendationid": "34765949", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960440131", "num_reviews": 20, "last_played": 1504684038, "num_games_owned": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 237}, "timestamp_updated": 1504652087, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Kinda fun game, but suffers from a clusterf*** interface.  \n\nSo here's how the game works.  You start out on a somewhat massive floor that's been randomly generated and filled with monsters.  Every time you click or move a square, you'll use a turn.  The gameplay somewhat resembles Diablo 2, but the developer went nuts and made the whole interface a mess.  You custom generate a character with something like 6 skills you choose.  Every time you advance a level, you can improve one of these skills.  \n\nHere's where things turn into a mess.  The character sheet has something like 30-50 stats that you can increase.  You have no idea what 90% of them do, but every item or skill will improve or lower several of them.  The major difference between this and Diablo 2 is that Diablo 2 stopped at 4 resistances and 5-6 stats.  Dungeons of Dredmore has 50 and it bundles them altogether in one cramped section that gives you a headache just looking at it.  \n\nBecause of what I mentioned above, the skill system is completely meaningless. I have no idea what would be a good thing to level up. Unless I spend an hour deciphering the stat screen, which I don't plan to do.  \n\nSame problem with items.  I just find the most expensive item and equip it...  I have no idea what is \"good\" in this game.  \n\nAnother problem is the flavorless monotony that is the gameplay.  You are dropped into the middle of a floor full of monsters and have to clear it.  Then you go onto the next floor and do the same thing.  Then the next and the next.  In Diablo 2 they had some storyline to break up the monster killing.  Stories about this horrible monster and that horrible monster.  However, Dungeons of Dredmor has NONE of that.  Just one floor of monsters after the next.  \n\nOn a technical note, when you start the game for the first time, the game will let you set whatever resolution you like including ones WAY OVER your monitor's capibility.  If you do this, the buttons at the top of the screen won't be visible and you'll be stuck at the main menu until you fix the resolution."}]}
