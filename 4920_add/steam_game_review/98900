I got it on a whim (during Summer Sale), and I am not disappointed with my purchase. I love to play games like these, and the graphics were actually very nice (even by today's standards). Sure, as many people have said, it is quite simplistic, but I think that is what works for this game; it isn't overly complicated, but not so simple that the game isn't good. Liked the change of environments, and wide range of enemies; always kept you on your toes. It is a short game, and can get repetitive at times, but overall, I would recommend to anyone who likes sandbox tug-of-war types!"}]}
