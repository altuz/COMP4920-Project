It has been a long and successful collaboration amongst 3 companies and very important for the operation team.\nWe came to know lots of players all over the world because of this game and became friends in the real world. We love EK players because they are always brave to express own thoughts, offering great suggestions, reporting bugs and their dedication to the game. We have the best moderator team that really did a great job connecting us with the players, giving so many valuable opinions that we were able to implement into the game. We wouldn\u2019t have come this far without all of you.\nWe won\u2019t forget those sleepless working over nights for every single version update, accidents fixes or even server rollback. Yes...it\u2019s a nightmare both for players and for operation team, but no matter good or bad, they were great experience to us.\nWe hope when you reading this, you will feel EK brought joy and fun to your life. On behalf of operation team, Time2Play studio and Perfect World, we want to say \u201cThank You\u201d. Thanks so much for playing Elemental Kingdoms. Thanks so much for your time and dedication to the game, and everything you did to make Elemental Kingdoms the great playing experience it was.\nAll the best to all of \nThe EK Team [/i]\n\nSo play the game for free, but DO NOT PAY ANYTHING.\nYou will risk loosing it with no refunds at all."}]}
