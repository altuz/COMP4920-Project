So, If you ever thought about buying this game you SHOULD know what you're about to go through.\n\n-The community is completely unsupported.\n\nI don't understand what is going on with this game but I must say that ATARI (Game Publisher) hasn't done a great job or let's say hasn't done enough towards the community and the game itself. If you visit the official website (www.testdriveunlimited2.com) you can see that the latest news was posted in late 2012. And if you go to the support area you will get an error message. Also, TDU2 Sever Status does not respond. Even though, if you try to register an account you will be forced to verify it through your email which you will never get the verification email. Last but not least, the website is not secure.\n\n-Game launch.\n\nI installed the game, tried to run it, but it does not work. Even though, it says that the game is currently running when I tried to run it for the second time. I'm not sure if there's a way to launch the game but I have tried as much as I can and I'm still experiencing the same issue.\n\nNow I can't disagree with anyone who's gonna tell me that I just lost my money because I literally did and I can't force you guys not to buy the game but you must know that it's not worth it at all and it's a waste."}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1506354736, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501691", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "35205445", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198132962377", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1471612773, "num_games_owned": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 17}, "timestamp_updated": 1506354736, "received_for_free": false, "review": "does not work"}, {"votes_down": 0, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1505005463, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "34850361", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": "1", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164185853", "num_reviews": 1, "last_played": 1500165630, "num_games_owned": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 18}, "timestamp_updated": 1505005463, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I have owned TDU2 on the PS3, Xbox 360 and now on the PC.
