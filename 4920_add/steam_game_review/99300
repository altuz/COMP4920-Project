As \na modern day homage to Jungle Strike it succeeds, but has achieved little else.\n\nThe gameplay quickly becomes repetitive, with little depth or variation. Despite there being four characters and an XP system there is little real replayability value from bagging achievements and XP grinding. Many of the abilities are shared by the characters, so I was very happy to stick with my favourite and play through the game without needing to invest \nmuch time on the others.\n\nAlthough this clearly isn't the focus of the game, I hope that from the awful, cheesy dialogue and one dimensional characters in the cutscenes the developers were clearly going for an over the top parody... Definitely a few small laughs there at least!\n\nIn summary, good for a short blast, but a game with no depth or longevity that quickly becomes tiresome. Ingest in small amounts."}]}
