It's full of personality, the protagonast is delightful, and the art is gorgeous.  But, the physics and control responsiveness is off.  Enough so that it felt more that I was giving suggestions and rough directions to the character.  The combat is boring and repetitive.  Hit three times, walk away, wait for chase, hit thre times, repeat."}]}
