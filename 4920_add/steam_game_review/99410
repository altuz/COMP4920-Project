The gameplay was bland, combat felt clunky with the keyboard and mouse, but improves with a controler. I'd say that the controller support is one of the few highlights of the game. It's clear that this game had a low budget. Low budget games don't have to be bad. I've played plenty of low budget games that had incredible gameplay and imaginitive stories (vvvvvv is one that comes to mind). It sort of feels like dead mage blew the entire budget on graphics at the expense of every other aspect of game play.
