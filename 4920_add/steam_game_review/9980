You just float around solving simple physics puzzles i.e. holding \"grab\" to collect various fruit, some of which might float to the top of the screen or others which drift to the bottom of the level to push a lever to open the way for you, or knocking a larger piece of fruit downward to press a see-saw type shape to let you progress underneath. The game's sounds and visuals are well-made for what they are, and seeing the flowers bloom / begin to glow as you fly near them while carrying other creatures who are playing various music instruments (a guitar, drums, etc..)  is a cool, chill effect, however the game doesn't do much to surprise you from these initial gameplay loops and characters, and begins to get mundane quickly. If you're dying for a relaxing game with cutesy characters in a mostly pointless venture maybe give it a go but I think most people will find they grow bored of what this game offers relatively quickly, even if you find the overall characters and design enjoyable."}]}
