The arcade gates change every 7 days and its random, so every arcade run you do will be different from the last. \n\nIf you wanna merchant, there is plenty of promos you can sink your money into. \n\nCons: \nThere is a ton of promos, one every 2 weeks. They throw promos out like they are candy and are not working toward new content and game updates. \n\nIf you have to submitted a support ticket then you should expect 2-48 hours of waiting for a reply. This is how they get money out of you, they force you into paying for in-game items with real money cause you cant contact support when you have issues of not getting back into a party. \n\nThe Develops and Gm's are not dedicated to running this game, and their minds are only after $$$$, but you are thinking what gaming company is not only after $$$$? All of them are, for the most part, but this one is one of the worst ones because as I stated they refuse to help you if you need help. I've heard \"sorry we couldnt help you out in time, maybe next time\" after they expected the rest of my party to wait 2-3 hours for me to get back into the party. \n\nYou need to see this game as it truely is, It is only about pretty costumes and accessories and thats it. This game is mainly used to see who looks the best and as a chat room. Just think of this game as a chat room version of Tinder with mini games to play like PvP and missions etc. \n\n\nSo end point is no i wouldn't recommend this game."}, {"votes_down": 2, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485441857, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509635", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 2, "recommendationid": "29502741", "votes_up": 10, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198279389817", "num_reviews": 6, "last_played": 1485488037, "num_games_owned": 4, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 572}, "timestamp_updated": 1485441857, "received_for_free": false, "review": "I started playing this game to get the free tf2 items.

Its unique concept is like none others. I'd definitely recommend this game. It has its \"dying phase\" but I'm really hoping that the Game Devs are still planning to update and put more content to the game. I'd purchase things that this game offer if it gets updated. ( SHOUT OUT: Paging Grey Havens, Please proceed to the Game Dev room now... )\n\nI know. It's boring if you're playing it alone. Make some friends, talk to strangers, don't be aloof. It's very addictive when you have people to share your moments with.\n\nHere's what I thought: \n\n> Artstyle - Its cute and very unique\n> Gameplay - Challenging. Well, not if you have good gears. Bottom line, its all about teamwork. Unless you like to play solo.\n> Music - Lovely music you got there bud. Its engaging.\n> Community - Its Great! That's why I love this game.\n> Players - I'd say 50 - 50. Some players are nice and friendly, some are not.\n> Concept - Can you name any game with the same concept? I can't. \n> Auction House - Oh my fudgy bars! Those are very expensive!\n> Supply Depot - Nooo! The trade market keeps on raising! Make it stahp! \n> Grinding - Aw man, this is a bad RNG. Need 'em orbs please!\n> Guilds - I don't know about you, but I love my guild. First and Last. \n> Wiki - Eh? Is the sidebar really down there? Hmm, care for a fix?\n> Steam Login - Why can't I login my Steam to Wiki page? That's crazy, man! \n> Servers - Oh my, why do I have a red dot? Mind if you guys put up some Asian servers? Please?\n> Patch Note - Oh come on!, Where the dang are the Patch Notes? I mean sure, you guys post updates on twitter... but....\n> DLC - I'd be fine if you make more of 'em DLC's too. Like maybe, a side story like OCH?\n> Price Boxes - Will you guys re-release Rageous Stuffs? I've been craving for them since I started playing...\n> Coliseum - Ah, no ones playing there anymore. Make some more PVP. Maybe like Capture the Ball? or Chess? or Maze?\n> Rank - Man, being a Vanguard ain't that good... What am I supposed to do now? Hoard stuffs? Collect gears?\n> Story - The stoy is incomplete. We all got stranded in Cradle. So, there's more content you can actually make here... Like maybe go to the moon? Well, why not?, Cradle has a moon right there in the Main Screen. And what about our homeplanet? our homeworld? What? they're just... gone? Still so many plot holes. And maybe you can have a story on why the Snabolax, Jelly King, Roarmulus twins, and Vanaduke keep on respawning each time we delve deep into the unknow parts of Cradle. Maybe because TIME is reseting? Cause why not, it is the Clockworks... get it? \n\nHere's hoping, like most of the Knights out there who still enjoys playing this game, that it'll live on for another 5 or more years. Because I know it's not abandoned yet. https://twitter.com/Cronus_GH/status/829819314475765760\n\nGood luck to the Devs - Grey Havens.\nKudos for keeping this game alive at the moment!"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485432456, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485166", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 1, "recommendationid": "29500366", "votes_up": 5, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198169952562", "num_reviews": 2, "last_played": 1504769067, "num_games_owned": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 15670}, "timestamp_updated": 1485432456, "received_for_free": false, "review": "Is greatly fun but difficult to get the full 5 star armor"}, {"votes_down": 5, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485979685, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457357", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29635223", "votes_up": 9, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198111518846", "num_reviews": 80, "last_played": 1464873048, "num_games_owned": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 112}, "timestamp_updated": 1485979685, "received_for_free": false, "review": "quite a gem"}, {"votes_down": 1, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1486855458, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503337", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29859967", "votes_up": 4, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198027541713", "num_reviews": 4, "last_played": 1505330507, "num_games_owned": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 2153}, "timestamp_updated": 1486855458, "received_for_free": false, "review": "So here is the thing I am going to say my OPINION on this game.

When I played for the first time (2010 maybe) it had a lot of people.\n\nQ:Is it pay to win?\nA:No, not even close. You can convert 10k crowns(the game's currency) into energy(the paid currency).\n\nQ:Why would I want the energy?\nA:To not grind xD\n\nTL;DR: Game is very grindy if you don't want to pay. Community pretty good but small.
