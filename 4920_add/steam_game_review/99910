It's a puzzler, entirely. Each puzzle is unique to each one, even though they do share elements. Something like bilging is for your match 3 type of people. Something like patching is more for people who like mazes. Being f2p in the game isn't bad once you get going, and if you're really good at the puzzles, you will easily be able to advance through the game at a relative pace. The community is still pretty lively, albeit the number of voyages available have dwindled since I first ever played this game. Over all, there's a number of good things, but a few quirks in the game.\n\nPros:\n*Technically not P2W. You can get different things, but only being good at puzzles will make you win\n*Music is good when it's there\n*Puzzles are diverse\n*Crews work nicely if you can find an active one\n*Learning how to do the puzzles better is very rewarding\n*There's not really much wrong with the game, if you find it enjoyable\n\nCons:\n*Music isn't always there\n*Advancing can seem slow if you aren't very good at puzzles\n*It's a time sink\n*Only the Emerald Ocean is all that lively.\n\nConclusion: Definitely a yes for people who like puzzlers. They're all unique, they're all enjoyable, even if you don't do very well, and they all have a nice atmosphere.

There is pretty much zero tutorial (only a brief introduction to the UI) followed by some introduction pages for the games one can open. The introductions are insanely confusingly written, most I've read twice or three times and was still not clear how the game works. So I learned the rules pretty much every case finally by trial and error. Not good.\n\nThe individual games are either puzzles (just click on the one you want and it just opens) or missions (it asks to do something, bit like a mini-quest, sometimes it ports you somewhere for this). The minigames are diverse but rather pointless besides \"play a game, get a little bit of money, rise the skill level which seems to have not much impact on anything\". At least so far I haven't found anything to motivate you to play a game besides that you hopefully want to play that particular game. Many of the games are not accessible without paying money for Doubloons or grinding enough ingame currency to buy Doubloons from the bank. Individual game sections (crafting, monster hunting, ship navigation & gunning etc) are all split into \"pay with Doubloons for 30 day badge\". \n\nMost money comes from pilfering trips with other players on a player owned ship, you can have up to ... (25?) players on a ship, individual tasks are all minigames. If you are on a ship you can't just leave (bad style) and if the game/task you like is already occupied by enough others you have to do another one (freeloading is frowned upon). So you basically spent hours doing the same minigame over and over for very little money to hopefully encounter other ships often enough and then try to plunder them (or be plundered). There are treasure chests and crafting goods besides the money, but it seems those stay exclusively with the ship owner? So you get money to buy Doubloons or maybe other clothes or weapon or resources.\n\nCrafting minigames do not yield any resources or items. You just lend a shop(pe) your workforce and receive a little bit of money in exchange.\n\nAll very puzzling honestly, the minigames are to some degree not too bad but it feels to me somehow pointless. I've played a lot of FreeRealms and minigames gave resources there which I could then use for crafting in other minigames. Usually I played the minigames for the sake of the minigames but there was a meta game on top that made it feel more like an actual world and overarching motivation. Completely lacking here.\n\nOh and if a shop does not have items pre-made available (the norm) then you can order it for ingame money - but it usually needs to be \"delivered\" (despite you showing up at this island and shop) for Doubloons usually. Which means you are either spending real life money for a few pixels or you grind ingame currency to exchange for Doubloons. Just to give you an idea: puzzles give 25ish coins, plundering a ship 500-800 coins maybe initial (and a bit more at port if you stay so long) - and a Doubloon is roughly 4000-5000 coins. But you need 5 Doubloons to have the monthly crafting badge activated and simplest clothing or furniture cost 1-5 Doubloons to \"deliver\" usually. Besides clothing and furniture there seems very little to buy anyway (besides the ship you want, but for which you need for navigation an officer badge ... more Doubloons).\n\nSo no, I don't really recommend it. Wouldn't mind paying a monthly fee if this whole Doubloon extra charging was then gone, but it isn't. Feel like an insane nickle and diming with barely any explanation and no point to grind."}, {"votes_down": 7, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": true, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1485398234, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482139", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 0, "recommendationid": "29494091", "votes_up": 1, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198025543872", "num_reviews": 450, "last_played": 1485398229, "num_games_owned": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 5}, "timestamp_updated": 1485398234, "received_for_free": false, "review": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"}, {"votes_down": 16, "written_during_early_access": false, "voted_up": false, "language": "english", "timestamp_created": 1487151727, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473264", "steam_purchase": true, "votes_funny": 9, "recommendationid": "29938340", "votes_up": 2, "comment_count": 0, "author": {"steamid": "76561198060403159", "num_reviews": 5, "last_played": 1448787431, "num_games_owned": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_forever": 46049}, "timestamp_updated": 1487151727, "received_for_free": false, "review": "(Ex)-GF made me play with her.
